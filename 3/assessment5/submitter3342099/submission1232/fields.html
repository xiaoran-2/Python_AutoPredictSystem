    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammalian cell a methyl group is added to 5th carbon in cytosine followed by guanine and that's how methylation is stated. The problem is that methylated cytosine can be easily converted into thymine. In mammals methylation is laid down thanks to DNMT3a/b (de novo), and because of symetric nature of CpGs it happens on both strands of DNA. To maintain methylation, DNMT1 lay down methylation on daughter strand after replication. CpG islands are located in promoters of genes (60%), also tumor suppressor genes, so in most of normal cells CpG islands are not methylated (exception-eg. X chromosome inactivation). Unfortunatelly, in cancer those places in genome tends to be methylated what leads to tumor suppressors silencing and the cancer is allowed to develop.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and they constitute most of genome. At intergenic regions it is thought that methylation helps to maintain the genomic integrity, eg. cryptic promoters (between genes, act in opposite direction) are silenced. Repetitive elements are methylated in for the same reason, but normally they acts differently - like transpozoons what is highly mutagenic and silencing is laid down to prevent it. Repetitive elements have strong promoters and silencing them helps to aviod transcriptional interference (in long terminal repeats) and metylation leads to compacted chromatine that is not prone to recombinate. In cancer, those parts of genome are not methylated what leads tp genomic instability and it is visible in all types of cancer. Repeats that are unmethylated tends to tranpose and cryptic promoters are activated, we can see deletions, insertions andreciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a result of a "battle" between paternal and maternal expectation, as a father wants a baby to be big and a mother wants to have a little offspring. Reprograming is available because of parental marks (ereased between generations) that wring demethylation (passive in mothers, active in fathers). In PGCs resseting maternal marks leads to oocytes with maternal imprinted genes methylated, inversely in sperm. Igf2 gene codes hormone which stimulates growth and normally maternal Igf2 is silenced whereas Igf2 receptor is active (conversely with paternal gene). CTCF is an insulator and prevents enhancers from binding to Igf2 and is active in maternal chromosome, what makes H19 active, on paternal chromosome ICR is methylated, CTCF is not binded, H19 is silenced and Igf2 is active. In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 is expressed both on maternal and paternal chromosome and is a result of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome where maternal chromosome acts like paternal one. This results in overexpression of growth promoting genes. Diseases are effects of loss of methylation in ICRs and abnormal expression of imprinted genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent used for <span>myelodysplastic syndromes treatment. It is incorporated only into DNA and ousts methylation. Removing methylation restore normal function of tumour suppressor genes and therefore reinstiute control over cell growth. Other way which decitabine acts by is as antimetabolite - it causes direct cytotoxic effect on tumour cells resulting in their death.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and originally thought to be irremovable, and as methylation helps to maintain genome stability effects of those drugs can last. What's more, as methylation is insuffisient to stop transcription, DNMTs recruits proteins eg to maintain deacethylation. Sensitive periods are moments when clearing of epigenetic marks occurs via DNA demethylation - in germ cell development and early embryonic development. Those are periods when epigenetic reprogramming happens and genome is instable. During those periods treating is not advisable as epigenetic marks are not present and cells are able to be totipotent. In addition if drug is used to methylate DNA it would derange reprogramming what can leads to eg. invalid germ cells (infertilty).</p></div>
