    <h1>Submission 1467 from Anon (session_user_id: 58f8d94718ab8b9ff2162dba1b260dccf7508847)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA-demethylating agent</li>
<li>it decreases the amount of DNA methylation and removes the methyl group</li>
<li>It can make the cancer cell more suciptible to chemotherapy by altering its epigenetic state</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA-methylation is mitoticaly heritable that's why it's passed from the mother cell to the doughter cells </li>
<li>A sensitive period : is the period that the DNA is most susceptible to environmental effect or any other external effect </li>
<li>Premordial germ cell development , early gastation </li>
<li>Because it would affect the normals cells and it might be teratogenic , or yield an inappropriate growth for normal cells , or even it might be lethal </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>To silence specific genes in order to deffrantiate the cells from type to type</li>
<li>It is hypermethylated at CpG islands in cancer cells</li>
<li>It silences important genes like tumor surpressor genes , which in turn gives the tumor the ability to grow</li>
<li>In intergenic regions it helps to maintain genome integrity ( Silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites) , in repetitive elements it helps genomic stability (silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition , silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination) it also helps in genomic defense( protect the gene from transposons)</li>
<li>They are hypomethylated </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the paternal allele , the H19 and the ICR are methylated so the enhancers act on the igf2 gene and its expressed </li>
<li>I. the maternal allele , the igf2 gene is methylated and the promoting region is not methylate and the ICR , so the CTFC binds to the ICR , and the enhancers act upon the H19 gene so it's expressed and the igf2 gene is not expressed</li>
<li>In wilm's tumor there is methylation of the H19 gene on both the maternal and paternal alleles ( the ICR ) and theres overexpression of the igf2 gene </li>
<li>The hypermethylation of the ICR contributes to the loss of the growth restricting genes and the overexpression of the growth promoting genes</li>
