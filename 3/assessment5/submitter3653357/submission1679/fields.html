    <div class="field-value"><p>In<strong> CpG islands</strong> is where you can find more CpG dinucleotides, and you tend to find it at the <strong>promoter</strong> of the gene. They’re usually <strong>unmethylated</strong>, what means that there is gene expression. <strong>Methylation</strong>, in general, inhibits/<strong>silence gene expression</strong>.</p>
<p>In cancer, we can see that the <strong>CpG island’s methylation increases</strong>from normal tissues through neoplasia and metastatic tissue (unlike global methylation, that decreases). “They are not all methylated, but it’s more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell.” That’s called <strong>CpG (CGI) islands hypermethylation</strong> and it’s found in the promoters of <strong>tumor suppressor genes</strong>. That means that these genes are silenced and, in this way, they can’t do their function (downregulate proliferation, induce cell death…). This allows the cell to have an advantage over the others and, in general, this allows the cell to achieve the characteristic hallmarks of cancer, the development of the disease. </p>
<p>In terms of <strong>global methylation</strong>, specifically intergenic regions and repetitive elements, we know that, in a normal cell, they’re <strong>usually methylated</strong>. But, instead, <strong>tumor cells</strong> have <strong>not</strong> this regions <strong>methylated</strong>, as mentioned above; they have less methylation compared to a normal cell, and this is a progressive process, like the methylation of the CpG islands.</p>
<p>It is believed that the hypomethylation of this regions (intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements) causes a <strong>decrease of</strong> <strong>stability of the genome</strong> (gain chromosomes, loss of chromosomes, translocations…). It determines <strong>illegitimated recombinations</strong> between repetitive regions, because if they are hypomethylated (so, the chromatin is open), they can misalign.</p>
<p>This repetitive elements can also <strong>make copies of themselves</strong> and <strong>transpose</strong> or <strong>jump around the genome</strong>. That means that they can disrupt the coding region of a gene or activate/inactivate other surrounding genes.That contributes to the develop of the disease (cancer). They also cause different outcomes depending on where it’s happening.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> H19/Igf2 cluster has the imprint control region methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele.</p>
<p> In the case of the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, which is unmethylated, the enhancers act on <strong>H19</strong> because <strong>CTCF</strong> insulates its ICR. In this way, <strong>Igf2 will be silenced</strong> for the maternal allele, so there’s no expression of this gene.</p>
<p> On the other hand, because of the methylation of the ICR in the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, the enhancers act on <strong>Igf2</strong>. So, in contrast to the maternal allele, <strong>Igf2 is expressed</strong>.</p>
<p> In <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong> we find the <strong>maternal allele methylated</strong>, that means that Igf2 is expressed unlike the maternal allele in normal cell. Hence, we may find <strong>twice the normal level of Igf2</strong> which <strong>increase growth promotion</strong>.</p>
<p> This hypomethylation of the imprint control regions are also associated with <strong>preneoplastic tissues</strong>. That means that they could be, and in fact they are, associated with the develop of cancer, with the develop of disease.That is because if you promote growth a lot, if there are not any control, the cell will divide rapidly and that promotes tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong> Decitabine</strong> belongs to <strong>DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi)</strong>, being DNMT a DNA methyltransferase, and it’s a drug approved by the FDA, like Vidaza is.</p>
<p> Decitabine is a <strong>nucleoside analog</strong>. It’s incorporated to DNA during replication, as a normal nucleoside. Then, when DNMT1 comes along to bind and methylate it (copying the methylation from the mother strand), the <strong>DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly</strong> and it can no longer be released. We can see that its function is replication dependent, so you need the cell dividing.</p>
<p> The <strong>anti-tumour effect</strong> of this drug is based on the rapidly division of cancer cells, that means that they’ll be more severely affected because they’re replicating more in comparison to normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we’ve said, <strong>some drugs can alter DNA methylation</strong>. We use them against cancer cells, but they also affect normal cells and <strong>causes long terms consecuences</strong>, enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sensitive periods’</strong> are defined like periods when epigenetics marks are being established, and is characterized by that the <strong>environment</strong> may be able to <strong>influence</strong> <strong>epigenetic makeup</strong>; they are more sensitive to be altered by environment than the cells in maintenance periods.</p>
<p>The period of production of mature eggs and sperms, called <strong>Primordial Cell Development</strong>, and <strong>Pre-implanted</strong> and early <strong>Post-implantation</strong> period seem to be two sensitive periods, because they’re both periods of <strong>epigenetic remodeling</strong>.</p>
<p>If you use this drugs during sensitive periods, you’re likely to affect some cells, like <strong>gametes</strong> or, if you are pregnant, your <strong>offspring development directly</strong>. That’s the reason because it’s <strong>inadvisable</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if you inhibit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), you’ll not be able to maintain the methylation during replications, during cell divisions. That’s dangerous in both cases described before, because you can determine death or disease in this cell and, later and if it while you’re pregnant, in your offspring.</p></div>
