    <h1>Submission 220 from Anon (session_user_id: 74f94cd5ae3af10b0e8721e3f51e9914959cd7e6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, as well as vidaza, belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is similar to 5-Azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1). It is  a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. Then, when the DNMT comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNMT is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. This means that the action of these DNMTi are division dependent: they act during the replication: cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly than other cells, will be more severely affected.</p>
<p>High Decitabine doses were toxic and didn't have any specific effects. But lower doses have a very good anti-neoplastic effect because they cause DNA demethylation. That´s why it´s supposed decitabine is effective on cancers that are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, as haematological malignancies. Maybe it has an effect through other ways as well since its mechanism is not totally clear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at cytosines that are followed by guanines (CpG dinucleotides). Many CpGs are found in "CpG islands" (CGIs), where there are more CpGs than it would be expected by chance. They tend to be found at the promoters of gene's  and methylation is almost universally synonymous with silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In a normal cell, CGIs are hypomethylated (no methylation at CpG islands). In contrast, in a cancer cell, some  CGIs are more likely to be methylated. Hypermethylation at CpG islands in cancer occurs at the tumor suppressor genes promoters. So, this is a way that a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes and, therefore, one of the insults needed to cell immortalization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since DNA methylation is maternically inheritable is a very effective way of silencing a tumor supressive gene.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other regions of the gene where there is DNA methylation. Repetitive elements, as well as intergenic regions, tend to be methylated around the genome in a normal cell. Its function is to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters and preventing illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In cancer, the repetitive elements (as well as intergenic elements and introns) are hypomethylated.  Therefore, cancer hypomethylation of the repetitive elements increases gene instability and mutations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To sum up, there is "methylation swap" in cancer: The global level of methylation decreases as you progress from a normal tissue through to a metastatic tissue. But, at the same time, methylation at some CpG islands becomes more dense. So, because of this change, as it goes through normal tissue to hyperplasic tissue, to neoplasia and then invasive tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs). Imprint is associated with DNA methylation at the ICRs. So DNA methylation alterations caused by epigenetic drugs could alter the imprinted genes methylation during sensitive periods. These modifications are heritable and, therefore, maintained along the time.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are those whose cells are suffering epigenetic reprogramming on imprinted genes: epigenetic marks are clearing and resetting again. This sensitive periods occur during the early development (since the egg is fertilized by the spermatozoid until the epiblast formation) and during the primordial germ cells (PGCs) development (during the gametes formation).</p>
<p>So maybe we still need to keep in mind that younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells, should not be treated with epigenetic drugs. The epigenetic changes causes by these drugs would be maintain and pass through the gametes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Loss of imprinting is one of the common features of cancer because lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth, either they are growth promoting or growth suppressing. So hypermethylation of imprint control regions (IRCs) is not exclusive in cancer. You can also find hypomethylation, and this depends on the particular IRC and the function of the genes that are found within the control region.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One example of hypermethilation of IRCs is the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm´s tumour:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a normal cell, on the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated allowing insulator protein CTCF and its cofactors to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter. On the paternal allele methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers to access Igf2. Therefore, in the normal cell there are the maternally expressed H19 and paternally expressed Igf2 genes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Wilm´s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of the IRC on the maternal allele: there is Igf2 expression in both alleles and a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with this childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>
