    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at gene promoters. Their methylation serves to silence gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer we observe an increase of DNA methylation at CpG islands (hypermethylation). CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, which leads to their silencing and contributes to disease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer. Normally, their methylation provides genomic stability. Hypomethylation in repetitive regions leads to recombinations of DNA such as deletions and insertions as well as translocations due to the euchomatin form of DNA. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters results in activation of genes that may contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting. It can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>When ICR is methylated on the paternal allele the enhancers act ot Igf2 but the maternal is silenced.<br />In wilms tumour we have a double dose of Igf2, which is promotes growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA. When it demethylates tumour suppressor genes it restores their ability to regulate cell division and growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine is also a antimetabolite. They produce a direct cytotoxic effect that cause death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased.<br />Periods when epigenetic marks are being established are called sensitive. In mammals there are two sensitive periods of development: the period of primordial germ cells development till production of mature eggs and sperms, and the second one: the pre-implantation and early post implantation period.<br />It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as it will affect not only the targeted genes but the whole genome.</p></div>
