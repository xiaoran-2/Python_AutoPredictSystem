    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands are specific area of DNA with higher than average CpG count and found in gene promoters.  Most CpG islands within promoters are usually unmethylated in normal cells.  DNA methylation at CpG islands usually represses expression of the gene from the promoter.  Often cancer cells become aberrantly hypermethylated (i.e. more than normal) in these promoter  regions resulting in repression of the expression of genes.  Genes most likely affected by CpG hypermethylation in cancer for example as tumor suppressors.  The normal function of these gene products is to control cell growth, and they therefore need to be switched off to allow unregulated growth in tumors.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells to promote packaging of the DNA and to inhibit recombination between repetitive elements.  In cancer cells these intergenic regions often lose methylation (become hypomethylated).  The release of silencing of repetitive elements leaves them open to the recombination machinery.  Due to their repetitive nature they have many regions of homology that lead to recombination between repeats on different chromosomes/area.  These translocations can lead to aberrant silencing (e.g. tumor suppressors) or activation (e.g. oncogenes) of genes and creation of gene fusion products.  <br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analogue that when incorporated into DNA irreversibly binds DNMT, rendering it enzymatically inactive.   DNMT is responsible for methylation the new DNA strand, therefore inhibiting it results in DNA hypomethylation.  It is likely that the main effect of Decitabine in cancer therapy is preventing the methylation of CpG islands in the promoters of  of tumor suppressor genes.  As discussed in Q1 the methylation of CpG islands in these promoters usually switches the genes off, therefore Decitabine prevents this switching off and allows the expression of tumor suppressor genes that inhibit the further growth/cell division in the tumor cells.  DNMT inhibitors have shown particular promise in myelodysplastic syndrome, a pre lymphoma that often displays disordered DNA methylation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. At a point of DNA methylation,  as  the new DNA strand is synthesized it is methylated </span><span>de novo</span><span> by DNMT.  This means methylation at this location will potentially be maintained in the cells and any daughter cells and descendants for the rest of the organism’s life (and possibly through the germ cells continue on for generations)</span></p>
<p><br /><span>A sensitive period is a period of time where the epigenome is undergoing active reprogramming and is therefore more sensitive to perturbation of the epigenetic creating/maintaining machinery.  Examples of this are in the early embryo and also during the creation and development of germ cells.  Treating patients during this time (pregnancy, early childhood when germ cells of next generation maturing and probably a couple activly trying to conceive)  would be inadvisable as it could impact the epigenome of future offspring resulting in embryonic death or growth defects and other gene expression anomalies in offspring and possible further descendants.  <br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The Igf2/H19 locus can be methylated in two places - the imprint control region (ICR) and the H19 promoter.  Methylation of the ICR allows binding of CTCF, an insulator protein that prevents expression of  Igf2.  Downstream enhancers have a preference for the Igf2 promoter over the H19, but if Igf2 is insulated they will bind the H19 promoter instead.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated,  so CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 is available for the enhancers to bind and activate expression.  The absence of CTCF also allows DNA methylation to spread to the H19 promoter, switching H19 expression off.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is normally unmethylated allowing binding of CTCF which insulates Igf2 and prevents its expression  The H19 promoter is unmethylated and the enhancers are free to bind and promote expression.</span></p>
<p><span><span>These mechanisms ensure that normally there is only H19 expression from maternal allele and Igf2 from the paternal, and therefore each are expressed in appropriate amounts.  In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of both alleles becomes methylated, resulting in no H19 expression and double expression of Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth promoting protein and therefore a double dose results in aberrant overgrowth in the tumor.  Loss of imprinting affecting growth promoting or inhibiting proteins is a common early step in tumorigenesis.</span><br /></span></p></div>
