    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally associated with silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpG sites can be bound by MeCP1 and MeCP2, which contain a repression domain. They can also recruit factors that condense chromatin, reducing access to RNA transcrpitase to the gene, preventing expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands associated with tumor supressor genes are often hypermethylated, silencing the genes. This can count as a 'hit' to the DNA, a contribution which, if coupled with other 'hits', can result in cancer, as per the Knudson hypothesis. The silencing of a tumor suppressor may result in a cell dividing more rapidly or evading apoptosis, giving it a selective advantage over other cells, causing progression in the development of the tumor. In certain cancers, the CpG islands of certain sets of genes can be found to be hypermethylated. These cancers display the CIMP phenotype. It has also been found that CpG sites in CpG island shores tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. </p>
<p>In intergenic regions, DNA methylation has a function in silencing cryptic splice and promoter sites, promoting genomic stability by preventing, for example, transcriptional interference, which is especially a problem if it occurs within a gene. At repetitive elements, DNA methylation can prevent transcription of the gag and pol proteins, preventing the transposition of the elements. DNA methylation also serves to prevent illegitimate recombination when repetitive elements align.</p>
<p>In cancer repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be hypomethylated. This allows transposition of repetitive elements to take place, which can be especially problematic if they are transposed in such a way that they disrupt nearby genes in their new locations; tumor suppressor genes may be silenced, conferring cells the ability to divide more rapidly and to avoid apoptosis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, preventing DNA methylation from being laid down during cell replication, at specific doses. Being a nucleoside analogue, it can do this by binding to DNMT enzymes irreversibly. Because cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, they are more serverely affected by decitabine than normal cells. Decitabine can prevent the maintainence of methylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes, preventing daughter cells from being conferred advantages such as avoiding apoptosis, rapid and sustaied division and sustained proliferative signalling, which may lead to the formation of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> On the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated and can be bound by CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from its downstream enhancers, allowing the enhancers to act on H19, enhancing its expression on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, the cluster is paternally imprinted. Here CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers act on Igf2. Thus Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele, but not the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene. The maternal allele is aberrantly expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. There is a possibility that a change in DNA methylation will be inherited by daughter cells, and so maintainence of the DNA methylation change is achieved. A sensitive period is a period when the environment can have an effect on the epigenome. The period of primordial germ cell development to the formation of mature gametes is a sensitive period as are the periods of pre-implantation and early post-implantation. </p>
