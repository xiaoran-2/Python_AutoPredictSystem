    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normally <span>CpG islands of promotors of genes are unmethylated if the genes are actively expressed and methylated if genes need to be silenced. In cancer cells we frequently see hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. This leads to their silencing and produces cancer phenotype. It was also shown that CpG islands methylation progresses with time. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In contrast, <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are highly methylated in normal cells, while hypomethyleted in cancer. This leads to genomic instability that is closely relates to cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine belongs to </span>DNA-demethylating agents. It causes <span>inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and thus during cell devision causes hypomethylation restoring cancer cells to normal methylation status. It is </span></span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation is a very serious approach in treatment that can cause <span>enduring effects on the epigenome. There are two <span>sensitive periods during development: early development and PGS development when epigenetic marks are cleared and then restored back. If we treat the cells during these periods we can cause serious changes in epigenetic state that will have enduring effects on the epigenome.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>On paternal allele the imprinted control region is methylated, and <span>Igf2 is expressed because there are some enhancers laying downstream. </span></span></p>
<p>On maternal allele the imprinted control region is unmethylated and bound by CTCF protein that acts as insulator: it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So Igf2 is not expressed. </p>
<p>Loss of <span>imprinting on the in Wilms tumour leads to Igf2 activation. And Igf2 is <span>a growth promoting hormone, so it causes tumour phenotype.</span></span></p></div>
