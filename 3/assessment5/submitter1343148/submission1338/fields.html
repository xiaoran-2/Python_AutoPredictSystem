    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated. This can occur in a locus-specific manner (individual CpG islands) or on sets of CpG islands. This hypermethylation can spread to the surrounding areas or "CpG shores", affecting CpG islands up to 2Kb away.</p>
<p>The level of hypermethylation correlates with tumorigenicity (for example, in lung cancer) i.e. hypermethylation increases over time as the disease progresses. This provides us with a mechanism for monitoring the decline and recurrence of tumours.</p>
<p>Moreover, the sets of CpG islands that are hypermethylated differ depending on the tumour type or sub-type observed e.g. BRCA1 hypermethylation of CpG islands in breast cancer.</p>
<p>This hypermethylation occurs at tumour suppressor genes (more frequently than genetic mutations), acting as one of the many hits triggering cancer in the Knudson hypothesis. These epimutations are rapidly selected for, as the cells that carry them do not die as easily and divide rapidly to form tumours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in cancer is genome-wide and has been observed in almost every tumour. It occurs early in tumorigenesis and progresses with time.</p>
<p>At repeats, this can cause illegitimate recombinations e.g. chromosome translocations, as the repeats can come into allignment when they are not methylated and packed into heterochromatin. Hypomethylation can also activate repeats so that they transpose (move around) and activate neighbouring genes, or disrupt their coding regions. This genomic instability increases the risk of cancer and disease.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation is also observed at CpG poor promotors, and is associated with gene activation e.g. R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The role of altered methylation in cancer is context dependent i.e. whether hypomethylation genome-wide or hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is more critical, can change during tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 (this is preferable over acting on H19), thereby driving Igf2 expression and decreasing H19 expression. CTCF is unable to bind to the ICR to insulate and prevent this.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF binding occurs and insulates the ICR, resulting in the enhancers instead acting on H19, driving H19 expression, but silencing Igf2 which is not expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss in imprinting, since hypermethylation is observed on the maternal allele. As the ICR is methylated on both alleles, they both drive the expression of Igf2, doubling the dose of Igf2 produced.</p>
<p>This hypermethylation is often observed in pre-neoplastic tissue, suggesting it is a very early event in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting, resulting in abnormal proliferation of cells and thus causing this childhood kidney tumour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is not the only mechanism observed - hypomethylation as well as hypermethylation has been observed at other ICRs in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA that is epigenetically modified by this drug, will continue to retain its altered state of DNA methylation until epigenetic reprogramming takes place i.e. it will be stably maintained outside of sensitive periods.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in development where epigenetic reprogramming takes place i.e. the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset on both the maternal and paternal allele throughout most of the genome (exceptions include IAPs).</p>
<p>There are two major sensitive periods: early embryonic pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating someone during these sensitive periods has the potential to greatly disrupt this epigenetic reprogramming, preventing important epigenetic marks from being established or removed. This could have a major impact on development, and even impact the next generation through the germ cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent - it results in the hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>It is an FDA approved drug that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>This drug is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into DNA when the cell undergoes replication. It will then irreversibly bind the DNA methyltransferase, preventing it from going on and copying the methylation patterns to the daughter strand. As cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, they will be affected more.</p>
<p>At low doses, this resulting DNA demethylation has an anti-neoplastic effect i.e. it triggers the death of tumour cells.</p>
<p>The complete mechanism of action is not fully understood. However, CpG island hypermethylation is thought to be a critical factor in the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome, explaining why DNA demethylation is good for treating this cancer in particular.</p>
