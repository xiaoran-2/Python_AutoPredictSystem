    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated to promote expression of regulated genes; while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to suppress transcript/gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells, locus-specific CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation occurs frequently. Hypermethylation also occurs in CpG island shores (regions surrounding CGI). <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Generally found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, silenced CGI  inactivate multiples of downstream regulated genes(the Knudson hypothesis). These single, or sets of CGI epimutations, accumulating over time, are rapidly selected for transgenerationally via mitosis (thus the cancerous cells).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Generally, disease-causing DNA methylation arises stochastically from infidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes. For example, mutation in human DNMT3B causes DNA hypermethylation in ICF syndromes. Specifically, however, the level and frequency of mutated hyper- and hypo- DNA methylation are stage-dependent (e.g. invasion or metastasis) in each tumor. Furthermore, different tumors show varied locus and genome-wide methylation profiles, i.e. reducing DNA methylation at sites of hypermethylated tumor suppressor can reduce tumorigenesis but Not at methylated repetitive regions.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs early in tumorigenesis, predominantly at repeats and intergenic regions. Hypomethylated regions, such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions (LINEs and SINEs), are genomically instable. Reciprocal translocations between chromosomal segements occur at sites of aligned repeats. Such abnormal deletion/ insertional gain in chromosomes, together with un-blocked transposition of repeats disrupting expression of coding and neighboring regions, cause deregulated promoter activation, transcriptional aberration of  non-coding RNAs, plus deregulated piRNA expression (and the corresponding, downstream piRNA-directed DNA methylation).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For example, overexpression of the lncRNA HOTAIR (at the HOX cluster) acts in-trans as scaffold to bind PRC2 and LSD1, causing the addition of inactive and removal of active marks to silence the metastasis suppressor genes in breast cancer.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In hypomethylated CpG poor promoters, the associated hypomethylated gene miR21 is activated to target the tumor suppressor PTEN, up-regulating the oncogene </span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">R-RAS</em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> in gastric cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting maternal and paternal alleles at the H19/Igf2 locus is reciprocal (paternally expressed Igf2, maternally expressed H19), and are governed by the insulator protein CTCF. Paternally, DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to and silence H19 promoter, so that the enhancers can act to activate <em>Igf2</em>; promoter H19 is silenced. Maternally, unmethylated ICR has CTCF and cofactor bound. CTCF insulates/ prevents enhancers to activate <em>Igf2</em>, freeing the enhancers to access H19 instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The diseases is caused by paternal uniparental disomy. The H19/Igf2 cluster loses imprinting by DNA methylation; that is, the cluster does not show monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, but show the expression of two paternal-like alleles and loss of maternal-like allele/ hypermethylation of maternal ICR, hence the dose of expressed <em>Igf2</em> (an oncogene) is doubled compared to normal cell. In addition, <em>Cdkn1c</em> (a tumor suppressor gene) expression is down-regulated. Overall, cell growth is aberrantly promoted, yielding cancerous cells and the phenotype of childhood tumors known as the Wilms tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine) is a DNMT inhibitor. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes/ acute myeloid leukemia that yield abnormally high-level of DNA methylation in cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine, a cytidine analog, is incorporated into DNA strands as azacytosine. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) recognize the azacytisine-guanine dinucleotides, and establish covalent bond between carbon-5 of the cytosine ring. Since that site is substituted by nitrogen in azacytisine, DNMTs remains irreversibly, and covalently bound to DNA, triggering degradation of DNMTs, DNA methylation function loss, and DNA hypomethylation in a cell-division dependent manner. In the rapidly-dividing cancer cells, Decitabine-caused-defects of DNA methylation gets more prominent than other normal-paced dividing cells. Hence, some cancer-caused DNA hypermethylations are hypomethylated</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In human cancer cell line, decitabine also causes double strand breaks, and DNMT1 may mediate cellular damage response.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, the drug fights tumors by aiding in epigenetic regulation (i.e., DNA demethylation) in cell cycle control and apoptosis (i.e., damage signal activation).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic effects are enduring when the alterations are mitotically heritable in somatic cells, and/or transgenerational inheritable via the germline. Transgenerationally, the altered methylation profile escapes global epigenetic re-programming; the incomplete erasure/ aberrant persistence of epigenetic marks can be transmitted and maintained via messenger molecules in germ cells (e.g. piRNA mediating RNA-directed DNA methylation in-trans.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of active epigenome remodelling during development: (1) period of primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs and sperms, and (2) pre-implantion and early post-implantation period of the early embryo. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treatment during sensitive periods is inadvisable due to lack of comprehensive knowledge in drug mechanisms. Mechanistically, the drug might cause aberrant hyper-/ hypo- DNA methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive relements,  histone acetylation/methlation, and chromatin remodeling, adversely affecting normal regulation and expression of regulators (e.g. promoters and enhancers), genes, non-coding RNAs and transposable elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perturbation of epigenetic reprogramming of  the early embryo might yield incomplete/ abnormal proceedings of embryonic differentiation and development, and implantation failure, causing early embryo death, infant defects, and infertility after puberty. Deleterious effects laid down in primordial germ cell development might  transmitted transgenerationally along family tree, as shown in some imprint disorders. </p></div>
