    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of a CpG island regulates the transcription of the downstream gene, by one of two mechanisms. The methylation of the Cytosin in CpG islands can inhibit the binding of transcription factors resulting in a decrease of transcription or, more commonly, aid in a repressive chromatin structure formation by binding CpG binding proteins, such as MeCP1 &amp; 2, which can repress transcription and can recruit factors that condense the chromatin to heterochromatin, which leads to less accessibility of the DNA for transcription and results in silencing of the genes in the affected region. Hypermethylation is associated with a silencing of the associated gene and hypomethylation results in an increased transcription of the associated gene.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes - that are usually hypomethylated - are hypermethylated, (=a higher amount of methylation in CpG islands), resulting in the silencing of those genes. Without active transcription of tumor suppressor genes the cells will divide uninhibited, causing cancer. Hypermethylated genes can be used as biomarkers to identify tumors. Certain cancer types show specific sets of hypermetylated regions, instead of just a single genomic region.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetive elements leads to an increased stability of those regions. Loss of methylation enables reciprocal translocation of repetitive elements due to their similar nature and allows repetitive elements to “jump” and insert themselves in other areas of the genomes, thus potentially disrupting other genes and genomic areas.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, meaning cancer cells show a lower amount of methylation than normal cells, which causes an increased frequency of genomic recombination, including deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocation and duplication, therefore disrupting the genome. This can result in genes being underexpressed (e.g. through deletions) or overexpressed (e.g. through duplications).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes express only either the paternal or the maternal allele of a gene. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, this is regulated by the methylation of the paternal allele in the control region of H19. The maternal allele is unmethylated and can bind CTCF. Both alleles have an active transcription of enhancers, but on the maternal allele the binding of CTCF blocks the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene. On the paternal allele, where no CTCF can bind due to the methylation, the enhancers reach and act on Igf2, activating transcription.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated, therefore, CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers act on the Igf2 region of both alleles, doubling the expression of Igf2. This is an example where hypermethylation does not result in silencing but in an increase in expression, by employing a different mechanisms called enhancer blocking. The methylation inhibits the binding of an insulator protein which blocks downstream gene expression enhancers.Without the blocking of the enhancers, the gene is expressed.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are often involved in growth and their changes in cancer early events. Igf2 is growth promoting and therefore increased expression of Igf2 enhances tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Therefore Decitabine can reverse the hypermethylation of CpG islands that is found in cancer cell. The reversal of the hypermethylation opens up the chromatin structure and allows the binding of transcription factors and transcription to occur. This re-activates genes that are suppressed in cancer cells by hypermethylation of the CpG islands in their promoter region, such as tumor suppressor genes. DNA-demethylating agents can counteract cancers that are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The advantage of this type of epigenetic drug treatment is that the resulting DNA change is mitotically heritable, which can result in “repaired” daughter cells and a remission of the tumor, as once the damage has been erased, it does not return. Side effects seem low, cancer cells are more affected by epigenetic drugs than normal cells, as they divide more frequently. Decitabine has been used successfully to treat myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are mitotically inheritable and are therefore passed on to daughter cells. This is how drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effect long after the treatment – once a cell is affected, the change will be passed on to the daughter cells, when the cells divide.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods during which epigenetic marks are erased and have to be reestablished. During those periods, epigenetic marks are more susceptible to changes or damages due to environmental components.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods, one during early embryonic development where totipotent cells start to specialize (up to blastocyst stage, prior to epiblast) and one during germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter the epigenome would not be advisable during a sensitive period, as the treatment can affect the establishment of epigenetic marks of the embryo during pregnancy or of germ cells that are developing in a young patient and can damage the epigenome of the next generation and therefore harm their development. It should also be considered that a pregnant cancer patient who is carrying a female fetus is carrying two additional generations, as the oozytes of the fetus are already developing. Treatment of a pregnant cancer patient could even affect her grandchildren.</p></div>
