    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">DNA methylation is an important chemical modification of the DNA that is carried out in CpG dinucleotides. It is involved in fundamental epigenetic processes such as the inactivation of the X chromosome, the formation of heterochromatin, imprinting, etc. It is also important for genome integrity, preventing a normal cell from having genomic aberrations. DNA methylation is altered in cancer.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">DNA methylation can be found in different parts of the genome, e.g. CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG islands are regions with high CpG content found in or near gene promoters. Its methylation leads to gene silencing by means of direct (blocking transcription factor binding) or indirect (promoting cromatin condensation) mechanisms. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated; in contrast, cancer cells have hypermethylation in these regions. This leads to the silencing of important genes such as tumor suppressor genes, promoting oncogenesis and tumor growth. CpG islands hypermethylation vary among tumor types and increases with time, and this feature can be used for diagnostics and prognostics in cancer.</span><span style="text-align:justify;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is very important for genome integrity and is altered in cancer. While CpG methylation of these regions is found in normal cells, there is hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cells. Methylation of intergenic regions is important because it prevents transcription interference due to anti-sense cryptic transcription start sites. It is also important to silence cryptic splicing sites. On the other hand, methylation of repetitive elements is important because it prevents gene disruption due to transposition and illigetimate recombination between chromosomes. The demethylation of DNA, via 5mC oxidation by TET proteins and cytidine deamination by zinc-dependent AID/APOBEC proteins to thymine, leads to genomic instability with mutagenic outcomes and cancer.</span> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">Methylation frequency and pattern are important characteristics of DNA that affect its integrity and regulation. Its role is context dependent and has implications for cell homeostasis and disease.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:medium;">One example of imprinted genes is the H19/Igf2 cluster in chromosome 11 (human). In a normal cell, the Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) gene is transcribed from the paternal allele, and its transcription is promoted by downstream-codified enhancers. On the other hand, H19 transciption is repressed in this allele by methylation of itself and of an ICR (imprint control region) upstream. In the maternal allele, this methylation is absent, leading to the binding of the insulator protein CTCF and the subsequent transcription of H19 (a non-coding RNA) promoted by downstream enhancers; instead, the Igf2 gene is not transcribed from the maternal allele.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">What would happen if the H19/Igf2 cluster losses genomic imprint? If the ICR and the H19 gene of the maternal allele are methylated, the cluster behaves now as the one found in the paternal allele. The insulator protein will not bind to the maternal ICR, the H19 will not be transcribed and the maternal copy of the Igf2 gene will be transcribed under the effect of the downstream enhancers. Now, the transcription of the Igf2 oncogene will be two-fold, with a direct implication in cell proliferation. This happens in the Wilms tumor, a kidney tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">The drug Decitabine or Dacogen (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to the DNMT (DNA methyl tranferase) inhibitor group. It is an FDA-approved drug used in epigenetic therapy. It has been used in the treatment of hematological problems such as MDS (myeloid dysplastic syndrome). Its mechanism of action involves incorporation into the DNA of replicating cells after been metabolized to the appropriate deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dCTP). Once incorporated, it interacts with DNMTs to form covalent intermediates, which ultimately inhibits DNA methylation in subsequent rounds of DNA synthesis. By inhibiting methylation, tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by hypermethylation can be reactivated, e.g. p15 (Daskalakis et al. 2002).</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;color:#000000;">If there were parts of the cancer cell genome that were abnormally chemically modified, e.g. hypermethylation, and then, by means of epigenetic therapy, those marks were removed, e.g. with DNMT inhibitors, after subsequent cell division cycles those effects will continue to be present because epigenetic changes can be inherited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;color:#000000;">Since epigenetic therapy is used systemically, the administration of epigenetic therapeutical drugs must be performed carefully, specially in sensitive periods, because epigenetic changes due to environmental stimuli can be transgenerationally inherited. These sensitive periods are 1) preimplantation and early post implantation, and 2) primordial germ cell development, e.g. in young patients. In this periods of active reprograming and remodelling of the epigenome, is carried out the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in different places genome wide. Epigenetic alterations of gametes in germ cell development could affect the progeny. </span></p></div>
