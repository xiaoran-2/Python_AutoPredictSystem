    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl group, which is laid down by some methyltransferase enzymes, to GA nucleotides. In the case of CpG islands, this attachment occurs in the CG sequence with two prior characteristics: They are located generally at the promoters and   in consideration of their symmetrical feature it is possible to inherit through cell division [1]. As the methyl group is enclosed at promoters, the transcription is not available and as a consequence we have silencing of gene expression.  </p>
<p>In a metastatic tissue, gradually, the level of methylation decreases but at CpG islands this methylation increases its density. This means that in a normal cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated and the rest of genome are simple methylated. But at a cancer cell CpG islands are methylated (hypermethylation)  and the rest of genome is hypomethylated. As a result, hypermethylation is found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which means there will be a no regulated cell growth by the inactivation of their suppression ability.</p>
<p>With more detail, in a normal cell there are hypomethylated GpG islands and both intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are methylated helping to the genomic stability [2-3] due to their relevance  to the efficiency of the noncoding repeated elements and the intergenic distance as DNA structure. For instance, if everything goes well in a normal cell, DNA methylation at repetitive elements helps to prevent transposition. So, in a cancer cell repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated inducing genomic instability and leading to transcriptional interference [4]. When we have a disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and  both are hypomethylated there will be confused recombination through repeats triggering insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations that can induce several kind of tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating/hypomethylating agent in the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMTi) inhibitor.</p>
<p>With balanced doses Decitabine/DNA methyltransferase inhibitor(considering that DNMT has a severe effect under cell division), is able to cause DNA hypomethylation, getting to kill tumor cells as it was described in myelodysplastic syndrome (lack of functional blood cells)  cases.</p>
<p>In order to compensate side effects with a suitable lower doses, the mix of Decitabine and a histone-deacetylase inhibitor (which have been affective with lymphoma) can decrease solid tumour growth or make tumor cells vulnerable to traditional chemotherapy as was shown by the researcher Stephen Baylin in his results of lung cancer. Another reason for its functionality is that DNA methyltransferase inhibitor blocks the deacetylation of some transcription factors [1].  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele where the imprinted control region is unmethylated, an insulator protein (CTCF) is confined with it and insulates lgf2 from downstream enhances which now they can act and induce H19 (long noncoding RNA) expression. On the other hand, in the paternal allele the imprinted control region is methylated; now CTCF is inactive, lgf2 is not insulated and as a result enhancers act on lgf2, inducing lgf2’s expression. When we have lgf2 expression there is DNA methylation spreading to H19 promoter in order to silence [1]. <br />In the case of loss of imprinting (both alleles act as paternal allele) there will be an excess of lgf2. As we know lgf2  is a growth promoter so if there is no regulation through some growth suppressor gene, epigenetic disruption will occur. This happens at Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, the patients with this disomy have overgrowth,  large tongue and high predispositions of childhood tumours. For example, the  Wilms tumour (kidney) that is a kind of abdominal cancer and it's generate by loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation have an important role in gene expression as epigenetic mark such as x chromosome inactivation, imprinting, accessibility of transcription and inactivation of growth suppressor genes.  Furthermore, DNA methylation is able to be maintained through cell division and even could be passed through generations under influence of the exposition in sensitive periods. S<span style="font-size:14px;">ensitive periods refer to a period of development when it is susceptible to environmental factors in order to determinate epigenetic control. There are two priority sensitive periods: primordial germ cell and pre/post implantation phases. These periods allow the chance of epigenetic inheritance.</span></p>
<div>
<p>During these sensitive periods would be inadvisable a treatment with epigenetic drugs because of this kind of treatment ( DNMTi and Histone deacetylation) can switch on and off silenced genes whose binary arrangement will consolidate (it's necessary to remember that an epigenetic state set up in early development is laid down for life due to mitotic heritability) the correct function of DNA methylation patterns (epigenetic reprogramming/alteration) impacting at post generations’  phenotypes  and health implications (as we see in Barker hypothesis and agouti viable yellow allele in mice). </p>
