    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One way cancer cells spread is to silence tumor suppressor genes by methylating CpG islands.  Then the cells reproduce at an accelerated rate, creating tumors.</p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit the methylation of the CpG islands (DNA-demethylating drugs) can break this cycle by allowing the tumor suppressing genes to regain function.</p>
<p>Decitabine is one of these drugs.  It reduces methylation by binding to DNA methyltransferase, which inhibits the cell's ability to transfer methylation to daughter cells during cell replication.  This dramatically slows tumor growth since new cells lose the cancerous methylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  These syndromes are the precursors to a form of cancer: acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A CpG site occurs when a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide.  A CpG island is a stretch of DNA where numerous CpG sites are located.  Typically, CpG islands occur in the promoters of genes.</p>
<p>CpG sites are important in epigenetics because they can be methylated:  a methyl group is added to the C nucleotide, changing the way the cell treats that stretch of DNA.  Typically, methylation happens on CpG sites in repetitive elements of the gene, and in its intergenic regions, but does not happen in CpG islands.</p>
<p>Leaving the CpG island free of methylation allows the promoter its part of to operate normally, allowing the gene to be expressed.</p>
<p>A tumor suppressor gene is a gene that slows the growth of a cell by reducing the likelihood that it will replicate.  In some cancerous cells, the CpG island of a tumor suppressing gene becomes heavily methylated (hypermethylated), silencing the gene.  This disrupts the cell’s ability to suppress growth, making it more likely to replicate.  Because hypermethylation is passed to new copies of the DNA when it replicates (mitotically heritable), this cell quickly spreads: it’s unable to slow its own replication, and each new copy has the same problem.  Ultimately, this unconstrained growth leads to tumors throughout the body and various forms of disease.</p>
<p>While we generally want CpG islands to be free of methylation, we want the repetitive elements in the DNA to be methylated and silent.  This keeps the genetic code stable by preventing these elements from interfering with chromosome recombination, and also keeping them from transposing to other parts of the genome and potentially promoting or disrupting normal gene function.</p>
<p>In cancerous regions, removal of the methylation in the repetitive elements can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, extra insertions and deletions, and disruptions to neighboring genes.  ICF syndrome is one example disease where hypomethylation in the DNMT3B gene is the cause.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many growth promoting, and growth restricting genes, are imprinted:  the paternal allele will be epigenetically modified in one way, while the maternal allele is modified in a different way.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 example, normal methylation has each allele expressing only 1 of 2 genes:</p>
<ul><li>The paternal allele has a methylated imprint control region.  This silences the expression of H19, but allows the expression of Igf2</li>
<li>The maternal allele has an unmethylated imprint control region.  This silences the expression of Igf2, but allows the expression of H19.</li>
</ul><p>In a Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and maternal alleles have methylated imprint control regions, providing a double dose of Igf2 (a growth promoting gene), leading to excess growth of these cells and the onset of a rare type of kidney cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation occurs throughout the genome.  Because cells are constantly replicating, the methylation must also be replicated.  This is accomplished with DNA methyltransferase, a protein that replicates the methylation of one strand of DNA onto its duplicate after replication.</p>
<p>As a result, any drug (or anything else) that alters methylation can have a long-term effect:  the drug may be gone, but the methylation change it caused will be spread as that cell replicates.</p>
<p>Because these drugs alter methylation patterns, there are times when they should be avoided.  These "sensitive periods" are the times during development when most methylation patterns are being removed from cells to provide a "clean" genetic code for the next generation.  There are two distinct sensitive periods:</p>
<ul><li>following the fertilization of an egg, until the epiblast is formed (first 1-2 weeks of human development)</li>
<li>during the process of a primordial germ cell developing into a mature sperm or oocytes.</li>
</ul><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods could have unexpected or larger than expected impacts on their epigenome, since the interactions between drugs and the normal cellular machinery is not well understood and the drugs themselves could prevent the removal, or rewriting, of the epigenetic marks.</p></div>
