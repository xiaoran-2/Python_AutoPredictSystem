    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is associated with genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation of specific loci.</p>
<p>Usually, CpG islands tend to be free of methylation. However, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated, which causes the silencing of the underlying genes. In this way, tumor suppressor genes may not be expressed, which contributes to disease.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Cancer cells, nonetheless, are characterized by the hypomethylation of intergenic intervals and repeats. This contributes to disease by leading to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal human tissue, the paternal igf2 allele is methylated, while the maternal allele is not. This means that only the paternal allele is transcribed and the maternal one is not. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal region of H19 is hypermethylated, which leads to the overexpression of igf2. The overexpression of igf2 contributes to disease by overpromoting growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. Basically, Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting BRD4, which at its turn blocks the activity of <em>Myc, </em>whose transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells through cell division.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is characterized by the establishment of epigenetic marks. Pre-implantation development and the primordial germ cells are such sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitiv periods would be inadvisable because it would alter their epigenetic marks or those of their descendants. In this senes, due to the effect on the germ cells, younger patients are not to be treated. </p></div>
