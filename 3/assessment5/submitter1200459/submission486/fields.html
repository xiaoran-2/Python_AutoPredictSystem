    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism. The 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells is methylated at the C5 position of the cytosine. The normal function of DNA methylation is to stabilize the whole genome and to silence specific genes through the formation of heterochromatin. In cancer, aberrant methylation occurs; more accurately hypermethylation of gene-promoter regions and global DNA hypomethylation. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressing genes, contributing thus to the disease.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with the suppression of alternative start sites, antisense transcription and direct RNA splicing as well as with the replication timing. Disruption of these regulating features, through aberrant methylation, contributes to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting may contribute to cancer. An example to this is the hypermethylation of the ICR in the H19/lgf2. The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. Thus, in the former case CTCF may bind to the insulator element and the enhancers downstream of H19 will act on H19 and lgf2 will be silenced. In the paternal allele, the enhancers will act on lgf2 and H19 will be silenced. Loss of imprinting will result in hypermethylation of the ICR and therefore both alleles will express lgf2, which is growth promoting. This double-expression, compared to the normal cells, is associated with Wilm's tumor.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents. The use of such an agent might result in the decrease in DNA methylation. In cancer, aberrant DNA methylation occurs; more accurately hypermethylation of gene-promoter region is accompanied by global DNA hypermethylation. The use of decitabine may result in a decrease of methylation in these hypermethylated regions that include genes involved in tumor suppression. However, this is tumor-specific and no generalizations should be made.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are certain periods in a person's life, in which reprogramming of DNA methylation takes place and are identified as 'sensitive periods' of development. These periods are gametogenesis as well as after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. During these periods any alteration in DNA pattern may result in enduring effects on the epigenome and therefore treating patients during these periods with medicine altering the epigenome would be inadvisable.</p></div>
