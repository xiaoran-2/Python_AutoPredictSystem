    <h1>Submission 157 from Anon (session_user_id: 3b4d3bcbc9b64da167883f4ed383974514c5c1ef)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and it works by hypometilating/demethylating the DNA. In other words, the hypermethylation which led to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in the first place can be reversed, because the DNMTi gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and inhibits the action of the methyltransferase enzymes.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an antitumor effect because it specifically targets DNA methyltransferases that maintain the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This drug depletes the DNMT activity in cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation in gene promoter regions. As a result, the silenced genes that can inhibit cellular proliferation, induce differentiation or induce apoptosis can be re-expressed, enabling, therefore, the tools to fight tumours, allowing cancer treatment.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue the CpG-islands of a gene cell are usually unmethylated. On the other hand, in cancer cells we will find that DNA methylation has been altered and now the CpG-islands will be methylated. Cells that have suffered this "mutation" are rapidly divided and are less likely to die, thus proliferating in the organism. This hypermethylation of the CpG-islands causes silencing of tumour supressor genes, who are essencial in controlling cellular proliferation, inducing differentiation or apoptosis. Since the tumour suppressor genes will no longer be active this results in spreading of the disease (cancer).</p>
<p>On the intergenic regions (IR) and repetitive elements (RE), the opposite can be observed. This means that the IR e RE regions are methylated on a normal cell, but they will be unmethylated in a cancer cell (hypomethylation). Since the IR and RE are important in maintaining genomic stability, once their methylation is altered there will be consequences, such as:</p>
<p>-Illegitimate recombination between repeats, which results in reciprocal translocation;</p>
<p>-Activation of repeats and transposition;</p>
<p>-Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>The illegitimate recombination can occur because the DNA won’t be densely packaged into heterochromatin, as it should be. On the other hand, the hypomethylation causes the activation of the repetitive elements who are now able to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose. The RE may disrupt a coding region of a gene but they may also activate neighbouring genes. This genomic instability causes transcriptional aberrations - addional deletion, insertions (gain part of a chromossome) and/or reciprocal translocations - all resulting in an abnormal karyotype that can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the H19/Igf2 cluster differs in each parent. On a normal cell, in the paternal allele, the ICR (Imprint Control Region) is methylated, so there is no binding of the CTCF on this region. Since enhancers have greater affinity to the Igf2 region than for the H19 region, and there is no CTCF, they will act on the Igf2, thus promoting its expression. On the maternal allele the ICR won’t be methylated, thus CTCF will bind to this region preventing the action of the enhancers on the Igf2. In this case, the enhancers will act to promote the expression of the H19.</p>
<p>On Wilm’s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation. What happens is that the maternal allele pattern will be similar to the paternal allele. This means that, in both alleles, the ICR is methylated and CTCF cannot bind there, therefore the enhancers will act on the Igf2 as they already did on paternal allele. This means that the cell is receiving a double dose of Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Since Igf2 promotes the growth and division (proliferation) of cells in many different tissues, this overexpression of Igf2 can lead to childhood kidney tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation are causing epigenetic changes on the cells. Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased by the epigenetic machinery the effects of these drugs can last beyond the period of treatment. On the other hand, it is known that cancer cell divide e proliferate at an higher rate than usual, so the treatment can be quite effective.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals/changes, this means that the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. In mammals there are two sensitive periods of development:</p>
<p>-The period of primordial germ cell development all the way trough to the production of mature eggs and sperms;</p>
<p>-The pre-implantation and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Since sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, an insult or a stimulus applied during a critical or sensitive period of development can have long-lasting effects. That is why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because when we take a drug such as a inhibitor of the epigenetic machinery this would be an insult to the environment, which could cause severe repercussions.</p></div>
