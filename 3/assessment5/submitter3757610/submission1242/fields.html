    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a healthy cell, DNA is hypomethylated at CpG islands, but highly methylated in repetitive regions, intergenic regions and in introns.  CpG islands are often associated with promoter regions, when they are hypermethylated the associated genes are suppressed.  Quite often in cancer hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, which, in turn, can make cancer more likely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Introns and repetitive elements are thought to be vestigial remnants of IAPs (Intracisternal A-particles).  Hypermethylation of these regions disrupts the retrovirus-like activity of these areas, and keeps them from replicating and inserting themselves throughout the genome.  In cancer, methylation of these areas (and the genome as a whole) tends to decline.  This can lead to 'illegitimate recombination', translocation between analogous repeats on different chromosomes, or to the repeats activating and copying themselves throughout the genome.  Either way it can lead to  destabilization of the genome as a whole.  This leads to a high mutation rate, which can in turn lead to cancer,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2  contains the Igf2 gene, the imprinting control region (ICR), and H19 and a series of downstream enhancers.  In the paternally derived chromosome the ICR is methylated, and the downstream enhancer activates the Igf2 gene. In the maternally derived chromosome the ICR is unmethylated, and binds to the CTCF protein.  This disrupts the enhancers access to the Igf2 gene, and silences Igf2 expression, but promotes the expression of H19 lncRNA.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal copy of the H19/Igf2 cluster behaves like the paternal copy.  For whatever reason the ICR in that copy is methylated, and the Igf2 gene is expressed from both maternal and paternal copies. Igf2 is a growth factor, and it's over expression is associated with overgrowth of kidney cells.  Disrupting this imprinting cluster can lead to a disease state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decetibine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  It is a nucleoside analog which incorporates into the DNA during cell replication, and irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase, thereby preventing DNA methylation. Since cancer cells reproduce much more rapidly than healthy cells, this effect disproportionately affects cancerous cells.  By disrupting the hypermethylation of CpG islands within those cells, it can change their gene expression and disrupt the tumors development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, although reversible, is passed down from cell generation to cell generation because of the action of DNA methyltransferases.  Therefore changes in the DNA methylation state of a gene can have enduring effects on the epigenome. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>During germ cell development, and again during early embryonic development, epigenetic marks are cleared and reset.  Changes in epigenetic state during either of these periods can potentially effect every cell in the body, therefore these two periods are considered particularly sensitive.  We know that the pre natal period in humans (particularly early on) is very sensitive, but the period right before conception can also be considered sensitive (for both men and women).  There is also some evidence that preadolescence may also be a sensitive period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic changes during sensitive periods can potentially affect every organ in the body, and might theoretically have consequences for future generations.  It is advisable to avoid treatments which might have epigenetic effects during sensitive periods to avoid unforeseen complications which may well last for years to come.</p></div>
