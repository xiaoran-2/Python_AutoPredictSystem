    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA methylation in a normal cell, CpG islands are left free from methylation independent of their activity state. But in cancer, promoter CpGs begin to become hypermethylated, thus silencing the underlying gene. Therefore, similar to mutations, DNA methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes allowing tumors to grow. For example, in breast cancer, promoter CpGs frequently become hypermethylated in the BRCA1 gene, affecting nearby tumor suppressor genes; resulting in breast cancer (disease). Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. DNA methylation at repetitive elements functions to protect the genome from transposable elements. In cancer, there is a genome wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions results in genomic instability: illigitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption of neighboring genes. For example, in mouse models, a deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissues can cause hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which leads to genomic instability and various diseases. In a more specific situation, in humans, mutations in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome, based upon genomic instability from hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. On the paternal allele, because the ICR is methylated, the enhancers act on and express Igf2. On the maternal allele, CTCF acts as an insulator on the unmethylated ICR, so the enhancers express H19, while Igf2 remains silenced. To summarize the first half of the question: in materal allele, ICR is unmethylated, Igf2 is silenced, H19 is expressed; In paternal allele, ICR is methylated, 1gf2 is expressed, and H19 is silenced. However, the loss of imprinting can result in the ICR being methylated in <em>both</em> the paternal and maternal allele. Consequently, the enhancers both express the Igf2. This results in Wilm's tumor, where there is a double dose present of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoter, which contributes to the Wilm's tumor. Hypermethylation, or in other situations hypomethylation, is active very early in development (preneoplastic tissue).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In tumor cells, there is a hypermethylation of DNA, and the nucelosomes are more densely packed. In addition, this occurence can happen frequently in large blocks or long regions. These large regions gain additional repressive marks and silence gene expression. Though epigenetic alterations are reversible, large-scale alternations in these long regions is usually hard to reverse, thereby having enduring effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Sensitive periods of development include primordial germ cell development through eggs and sperm that are  mature, as well as preimplantation and postimplantation periods. The least sensitive periods includes the somatic maintenance period. Younger patients that still have developing germ cells and sensitive periods cannot take these drugs that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. This would result in permanent or severe damage to their epigenome or further development processes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors Decitabine belongs to is DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine acts as a demethylation device when used in limited amounts. DNMT1 normally copies the methylation onto a daughter strand, until it moves down the DNA strand. However, Decitabine causes DNMT1 to get stuck on one portion of the DNA strand and now it cannot move around. Thus, there is not enough DNMT1 to fix the partially-methylated DNA strand. Over time, there is a gradual demethylation as cell division and DNA replication continues. To summarize, Decitabine stops the DNMT1 so that it cannot be used for further methylation ont he strand. Overall, Decitabine demethylates the DNA and restricts DNMT1 the more the cell replicates and divides. Tumors and cancer cells replicate and divide at a fast rate, so Decitabine restricts the DNMT1's methylation at an even faster rate, restraining the tumor's growth. </p></div>
