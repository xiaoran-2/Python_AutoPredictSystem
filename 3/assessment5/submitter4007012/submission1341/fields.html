    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from DNA methylation in normal function. Therefore, DNA methylation at CpG islands generally lead to the silencing of gene expression by one of two mechanisms: formation of a repressive chromatin structure via recruitment of remodeling factors (shifting from euchromatin to heterochromatin) or prevention of transcription factor binding which then alters gene expression. Both mechanisms render gene promoters inaccessible to the DNA machinery needed to transcribe genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs in tumor suppressor genes. In this case, DNA methylation silences a tumor suppressor gene and since it is mitotically heritable, the epigenetic mark is maintained in successive daughter cells, gene expression remains silenced.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancers can occur via a single gene or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), where sets of genes are frequently methylated. In addition, CpG island shores surrounding  CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer.</p>
<p>Normal DNA methylation function in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to maintain genomic integrity. DNA methylation renders these regions inaccessible to DNA machinery by condensing these regions within heterochromatin. Specifically, DNA methylation at CpG sites within intergenic regions prevent genomic instability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites and DNA methylation at CpG sites at repetitive sites maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats to prevent transposition and illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation is a defining hallmark of cancer. Hypomethylation occurs most commonly at repeats. Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions contribute to genomic instability due to several mechanisms: Illegitimate recombination between repeats will occur since the repeats are no longer condensely packaged in heterochromatin, activation of repeats and transposition will occur, as well as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes via transposition. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normally, the ICR (imprint control region) of the maternal allele is unmethylated, enabling the binding of an insulating factor CTCF4 to the ICR. The insulating factor prevents enhancers from promoting expression of the Igf2 gene and the enhancers instead bind to the H19 gene promoter. The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, preventing the binding of CTCF4, and enabling enhancer binding to Igf2 promoter, leading to IGF2 expression from the paternal allele.</span></p>
<p><span>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour because both the maternal and paternal alleles ICRs are methylated. Consequently, enhancers bind to and promote expression of the Igf2 gene from both paternal alleles, leading to a double dosage of IGF2 due to loss-of-imprinting via hypermethylation on the maternal allele in Wilm’s tumour.</span></p>
<p><span>A common feature seen in cancer is the loss-of-imprinting of ICRs. Many genes found within ICRs are involved in growth (either growth-promoting or growth-suppressing). Hypomethylation or hypermethylation of ICRs can lead to silencing of genes or enhanced gene expression depending on the context of the ICR. IGF2 is an oncogene and growth-promoting gene; therefore, overexpression leads to a predisposition to tumours.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA upon replication and when DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) binds to Decitabine (nucleotide) to copy methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is now bound irreversibly to Decitabine, preventing the methyltransferase from imparting DNA methylation for that particular nucleotide as well as future methylation in the daughter strand. </p>
<p>The action of Decitabine is division-dependent; therefore cell replication is required for therapeutic effect. Cancer cells, which are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, will be more severely affected by Decitabine than typical cells. CpG islands within tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated in cancer cells; therefore, Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect by preventing the action of DMNTs, consequently lowering the probability of hypermethylation of CpG islands within the tumor suppressor genes and prevents the rapid growth seen with cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; therefore the action of a drug altering DNA methylation within the epigenome in a cell will be seen with each successive daughter cell for the lifetime of the parent tissue or organism beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the period where epigenetic reprogramming, or the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, occurs. Sensitive periods of development include both early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs altering the epigenome during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the drugs are non-selective in their mechanism of actions. This means they do not just influence the epigenetic machinery in cancer cells, but rather all cells. As a result, drugs will alter the normal process of laying down epigenetic marks during sensitive periods with the high likelihood of adversely influencing the epigenome from the beginning by preventing the appropriate marks from being placed. The unintended consequences of alteration of normal epigenetic reprogramming will then be somatically maintained for the lifetime of the cell (and successive daughter cells if the epigenetic mark is mitotically inheritable) or passed onto future generations in the case of primordial germ cells.</p></div>
