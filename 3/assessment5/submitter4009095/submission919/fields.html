    <h1>Submission 919 from Anon (session_user_id: 24aa766ca44173b62437a0e4414a27a51988b804)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl-transferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Thus it blocks the activity of DNMTs in the methylation of CpG islands at promoter regions of genes. Specifically, they may do this by being incorporated into the nuclear DNA itself, so cancer cells (which quickly replicate) are more greatly affected than healthy cells. CpG island methylation is associated with gene silencing. In some haematological malignancies, the overexpression of certain DNMTs is characterised, and this results in the underexpression of some tumour-suppressor genes due to aberrant silencing of these genes. Decitabine may act by inhibiting these DNMTs and reducing their activity. This could prevent the silencing of tumour-suppressor genes and provide a way of controlling tumour growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are prevalent at promoter regions of genes and are commonly unmethylated. Methylation of CpG islands can lead to silencing of that gene, via the recruitment of MeCP proteins which further bring about changes to chromatin density by compacting it. They may also have a role in interacting with other repressive complexes, such as polycomb-repressive complexes. Additionally, CpG island methylation may inhibit the binding of transcription factors to promoters. CpG island hypermethylation is characteristic of the inactive X chromosome, where it causes the chromatin to condense and form mostly inaccessible heterochomatin, but genome-wide it is quite uncommon.</p>
<p>In cancer, an unusual increase in CpG island methylation is seen. The progression of cancer over time is linked to an increase in CpG island hypermethylation. Due to its mitotic heritability, CpG island methylation is passed on to daughter cells so is maintained throughout the tumour.  </p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation at certain CpG islands may induce the underexpression of tumour-suppressor genes, thus promoting cell proliferation. This CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) has been observed in colorectal and breast cancers, and glioma.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions (such as microsatellites) DNA methylation helps reduce the frequency of genomic mutations such as translocations, deletions or insertions, all of which can lead to faulty gene expression. DNA methylation at repetitive elements silences repeats and thus can prevent transposition, or interference from strong promoters.  </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of these regions has been observed in all cancers, which may be brought about by mutations in DNA methyl-transferases. Mutations to DNMT3a have been found in acute myeloid lymphoma, and similarly mutations to DNMT3b in ICF syndrome. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can lead to overall genomic instability and ultimately, aberrant gene expression. For example, failure to silence strong promoters could lead to genes being mis-expressed. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprinting control region and the promoter region of the H19 gene locus are both heavily methylated. Methylation of the imprinting control region means the CTCF protein is unable to bind. The Igf2 locus is located upstream of the imprinting control region. Therefore, enhancers downstream of the Igf2 locus can access it and induce its expression. On the other hand, methylation of the promoter of H19 results in its non-expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele shows no methylation, neither at the imprinting control region nor the H19 promoter region. The unmethylated imprinting control region allows CTCF to bind and this blocks downstream enhancers from expressing the Igf2 gene. The H19 gene is, however, expressed as it is unmethylated.</p>
<p>Overall, at this cluster, the Igf2 gene is paternally expressed while the H19 gene is maternally expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele (there is hypermethylation at the ICR of the maternal allele). The result is the overall over-expression of Igf2 and under-expression of H19. Igf2 is growth promoting so acts as an oncogene. Causes of this abnormality may be due to a mutation on the maternal allele, or uniparental disomy. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenomic alteration. So a change in DNA methylation patterns can have a profound effect on the daughter cells post-cell division and, depending on the extent and nature of the alterations, this may even affect gene expression. This indicates that DNMT inhibitors must be dealt with cautiously.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the genome is most vulnerable to genomic or epigenomic alterations which may be irreversible in some cases.</p>
<p>There are two main sensitive periods in a human’s lifetime. They are both when epigenetic reprogramming takes place and nearly all repressive epigenetic marks are temporarily removed. The first is around the time of early development, from the fertilised egg to the blastocyst stage. The second is from the development of primordial germ cells inside the foetus up until the development of germ cells. This could proceed right the way up to adolescence.</p>
<p>Treating a patient during a sensitive period (for example, a pregnant woman or a pre-adolescent) may result in long lasting changes to their epigenome, some of which may be undesirable. Furthermore, as some epigenetic marks may be passed on to offspring, the impact may extend to future generations. </p></div>
