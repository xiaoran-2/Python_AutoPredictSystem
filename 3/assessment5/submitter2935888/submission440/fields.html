    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation is an important process in the cells to maintain the good genes expressions pass through and establish in the daughter cells. DNA methylation is defined as an addition of a single methyl (CH3-) to cytosine at position 5. Normally, DNA methylation in mammalian only happened on CpG in the DNA sequences and it is not happening in the high density CpG islands. In normal cells, DNA methylation prevents genomic instability and spurious transcription initiations and the unmethylated CpGs islands prevent the cells from obstructions.  However, in approximately 6% of DNA methylation the stability of CpG island is disrupted. Transcription of gene occurs incorrectly and triggers instability of daughter cells. CpG methylation can cause the silencing epigenetic mark and inactive tumor suppressor genes. There are two types of DNA methylation that cause cancer, hypermethylation and hyphometilation. Hypermethylation causes silencing in the gene transcriptional process and hypomethylation causes protooncogenes, retrotransposons, and encoding protein that cause the metastasis of cell. In short, normally the CpG islands is unmethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In diseases, such as leukemia, prostate cancer, lung cancer, hypermethylation and hypomethylation cause the negative mutagenic. in normal cells the function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic integrity and make sure that the good heritability from parental cells pass through daughter cells. But disruption may happened in the methylation process at intergenic regions caused by deletions or insertions of  unwanted genes expressions. At the repetitive elements, disruption of DNA methylation to maintain genomic integrity can cause by the silencing of repeats or mutation of its. As the results, methylation may prevent necessary combination. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Alteration of DNA methylation during the development of human cells can caused the transform of human epigenome. Alteration can happen during the sensitive period. The sensitive period refers to important period of development of human cells. This period influences by transgenic inheritance as well as environment. Altering DNA methylation during sensitive period can cause an epigenetic difference. The sensitive periods of development happens during the first period after birth. The distinction of cell genome that not transmitted through gametes can come from the environment such as change in diet, nurturing, and chemical exposure. Research about mouses nurturing and epidemiology studies have been appropriate evidences of the influence of non-inheritance factors to the cause of malign development during sensitive periods. Stress responding to nurturing in mouses have proved that cross fostering after the sensitive periods does not cause the mature rats as stressful as mouses nurtured by careless mother during the sensitive periods. Correlation between grandparental food supply and grandchildren longevity is another example of how obesity, type II diabetes, and hypertension can pass through from grandparents to the grandchildrens. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because at that time the epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. At the time it maintained is the best time to do influence to change and reverse the malign influence.   <br /></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The Igf2/H19 is located in the human chromosome. Activity of H19 shows closed-relation with malignant cellular processes. These processes include invasion, migration, and angiogenesis, as well as the development of invasive tumor. lgf2/H19 produces non-coding RNA transcript that does not have definitive role, yet causes growth of various malign cell types. Research about bladder cancer, for example, showed H19 affect DNA methyltransferase that causes a consistent change in the methylation from normal to tumoral tissue in the methylated allele. Igf2, normally, is transcribed from the paternal allele leading to biallelic expression of the gene causing loss of imprinting that show in many tumors. Normal developmental programs had been interrupted at an early stage if bivalent genes appears in the tumor cells. The explanation about abnormal imprinting of the Igf2/H19 genes in tumor can be found in the description about Wilms’ tumor. Igf2 in this tumor is overexpressed, and orientation in transcription was reversed. Both paternal and maternal allele of Igfs/H19 genes is expressed in the normal cells. However, in the tumors, such as Wilm tumor, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype. Then, increasing cell growth happened because a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoted, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Intervention with the specific inhibitor of DNA methylation and histone modification has reversed the suppression caused by malign epigenetic process. There are many class of inhibitor available right now. One of them is decitabine. Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is classified as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine-induced inhibition of DNA methylation caused the inactive of X-chromosome locus, reverse the malign process caused by hypomethylation agents. Decitabine has been widely used to treated myeloid-leukemia. It works by helping the bone marrow produces normal blood cells and killing the malign cells. The stimulated dose-dependent of decitabine can help irreversible hemoglobinization and morphological differentiation. In short, the use of infusion with the right dose could help to modify the leukemia cell phenotype.</span></p></div>
