In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of methylation of CpG islands is to suppress the transcription of a particular gene or DNA sequence. In cancer this process goes wrong and there could be genome wide hypomethylation, and there is tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation, in this case the genes required for protecting the cells against abnormal or excessive growth are silenced. So, if there's excessive growth, there would be formation of tumors.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents recombination of DNAat those sites, if there were recombinations of DNA at erroneous sites it would promote chomosome aberrations and genetic instability. These changes in chromosomes affect gene expression, like silencing tumor suppressor genes or excessive expression of cell growth promoting genes, therefore that could lead to cancer.</p></div>
