    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation correlates inversely with gene expression as they are the usual location of gene promoters. When a CpG island becomes methylated, the associated genes are switched off by the formation of repressive chromatin structures blocking the attachment of transcription factors.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated.  Gene promoters, often located in the CpG islands, are turned off. Subsequent gene expression is lowered.  Cell growth genes activate (hypomethylate), and tumour suppressor genes are turned off, allowing cell division to continue unabated.</p>
<p>CpG island methylation also contributes to imprinted gene diseases. Here, both parental alleles are expressed, either due to irregular methylation at a promoter, or activation of another enhancer-type protein upregulating normal expression. Too much or too little expression yields overgrowth or retardation.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation is high at intergenic regions and repetitive elements because there are few or no genes, and transcription there often leads to errors.  Thus, DNA in these regions tends to be highly methylated and tightly controlled, especially at chromosome endings via histone modification, so the endings are not pulled apart.</p>
<p>Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is low in cancer cases. Genomic instability is high because much DNA is regularly (but wrongly) transcribed, and the mechanisms to stop transcription and further cell division (tumour suppressor genes) are turned off.  Repetitive elements are particularly error-prone: nucleotide sequence repetition leads to translocations, inversions, and other genomic mutations.</p>
<p>DNA methylation levels in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be low in the case of disease. With low levels of methylation, active transcription of these regions occur resulting in transcription error, leading to instability in the genome. These areas are highly methylated under normal circumstances, but as the control (methylation) over parts of the genome is lost, mutations and disease result.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions regulate imprinted gene expression. In gene cluster <em>H19/Igf2</em>, on human chromosome 11, Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome causes loss of imprinting. Whereas normally only the paternal gene is expressed, both paternal and maternal alleles are activated, causing overgrowth. </p>
<p>The maternal gene is normally not expressed because CTCF insulator protein blocks downstream enhancers, stopping expression of <em>Igf2</em>.  <em>Kcnq1</em> is methylated, inactivating <em>Cdknc1</em>, a tumour-suppressing gene. The imprint control region becomes methylated, and the CTCF insulator cannot bind to the DNA.  DNA methylation spreads to the <em>H19</em> promoter, causing activation of the maternal <em>Igf2</em> gene. The paternal <em>Igf2</em> gene is upregulated and overexpressed, causing overgrowth and tumours.</p>
<p>In BWS, loss of imprinted growth management genes causes fetal and postnatal overgrowth syndrome, macroglossia, and predisposition to embryonic and childhood (but not adult) tumours. As many imprinted genes control growth, loss of imprinted genes is a common feature of cancer.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, loss of imprinting on chromosome 11 inhibits expression of growth restricting genes and causes overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase from attaching to DNA. Cancer can result from methylation of tumour-suppressing genes in a cell, stopping expression of these genes. Tumours develop when a gene that normally suppresses cell division mutates, and the cell starts dividing, passing on tumour suppression genes that do not function, which further divide enabling the growth of the tumour. When these genes are turned off, cells no longer divide under the normal epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the cell.  Decitabine helps re-regulate out-of-control cells by removing methyl groups from the tumour-suppressor genes, allowing normal cell division to resume.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, a stable epigenetic mark, is passed on to daughter cells. After cell division, unmethylated CpG strands are rapidly remethylated by DNA methyltransferase, ensuring the lifetime stability of methyl marks on the genome.</p>
<p>Dr. Baylin found his patients more susceptible to chemotherapy after taking a combination of epigenetic drugs.  The drug changed the stable epigenetic factors of the DNA by actively stoping histone deacteylase from further damaging the DNA.  HDAC inhibitors and azacitidine alter methylation patterns. They speculate the drug slowed cancer cell division and reestablished normal cell division by demethylating tumour suppression genes. </p>
<p>Germ cell production and gametogenesis are sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Early in embryological development, the methyl marks are removed and then reestablished to ensure the proper parental marks are added. The first few days are critical to proper methylation and gene imprinting. If epigenetic drugs are used during preadolesence, they can interfere with the establishment of the parental lineage marks and result in an imprinting disorder in the next generation.</p></div>
