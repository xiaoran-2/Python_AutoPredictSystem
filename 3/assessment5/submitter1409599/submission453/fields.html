    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in CpG islands is a part of epigenetic code for appropriate nucleosomal packaging and accessibility of DNA for various DNA-binding proteins and enzymes. DNA methylation also serves as a template for methylation of a new DNA strand after cell division to ensure epigenetic maintenance after cell division and continuity of cell type-specific expression of genome. The exact function of DNA methylation depends on the position of CpG islands in the genome. Abnormalities in any sort of DNA methylation (including imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation) may lead to inappropriate epigenetic marking and, consequently, to disease.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in CpG islands in intragenic regions is required for appropriate nucleosome packaging and transcription regulation of neighbouring regions. In repetitive sequences, DNA methylation contributes to heterochromatin packaging in order to a) prevent their expression and b) silence strong promoters within these repetitive elements, which may affect not only these elements, but also neighbouring genes. Another important function of DNA methylations to remove accessibility to enzymes involved in DNA recombination to prevent crossovers between repetitive elements in different locations and ensure chromosome stability in normal cells. Demethylation of repeats results in chromosome instability leading to genetic abnormalities and cancer. Global hypomethylation of  cancer genomes changes expression and regulation of protein- and lncRNA-coding genes.</p>
<p>In the normal cells, DNA methylation in CpG islands in the coding genes, including their promoters, introns etc., affects binding of transcription factors and gene regulation in development and in tissue-specific manner. Similarly DNA methylation in CpG islands in DNA sequences, encoding various non-coding RNAs, is involved in regulation of their expression. Hyper/hypo-methylation of genes and RNA-coding sequences results in their abnormal activity, leading to various diseases and cancer. In particular, misregulation of proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressors could be cancer-promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal myeloid cells in bone marrow differentiate into leukocytes, migrating into blood. When gene regulation is perturbed, these cells proliferate and accumulate in increased numbers in bone marrow, changing blood cell composition and leading to blood disorders. DNA methylation is implicated in pathologically increased myeloid proliferation, which develops further into acute leukaemia. Decitabine (Dacogen) is used for treatment of such myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>This drug is a cytidine analogue, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Consequently DNA with incorporated decitabine cannot be efficiently methylated in a diseased myeloid lineage, so it is undermethylated. After cell division, this DNA becomes demethylated, leading to changes in epigenetic marks for chromatin packaging and DNA accessibility for transcription regulation. This, in turn, results in gene activation and corrected gene expression in myeloid cell precursors, which now can further differentiate in leukocytes. So drug-treated myeloblasts do not accumulate in bone marrow causing the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin’s group successful used epigenetic drugs (EDs) followed by chemotherapy for lung cancer treatment. Chemotherapy affects cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, but cancer cells are usually not sensitive to them and have increased methylation of histones and DNA specifically in gene promoters.</p>
<p>The epigenetic changes in tumour cells induced by EDs are maintained, making cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. Epigenetic marks regulate gene expression. So EDs inducing active epigenetic marks may activate tumour suppressors, checkpoints for proliferation and/or regulators of apoptosis, many of which are downregulated in cancer. The drugs can also restore proper regulation of proto-oncogenes and PRC2, which are induced in caner. On its own, these changes in gene expression may not be sufficient to stop proliferation of cancer cells with multiple genetic abnormalities. So chemotherapy following EDs, will interfere in proliferation of cells with induced check-points and will induce apoptosis in cancer cells, making chemotherapy more efficient.</p>
<p>Epigenetic regulation has sensitive periods when a majority of marks are reset in early embryonic and germ cell development. So using EDs in these periods, e.g. treatment of pregnant women, may be particularly hazardous for foetuses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">The chromosome 11p15 contains two imprinted regions <em>CDKN1C/KCNQ1</em> and <em>H19/IGF2</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The <em>H19/IGF2</em> region is paternally methylated in the <em>H19</em>-coding region and the insulator sequence between <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2</em> genes, leading to silencing of lncRNA H19 expression and preventing CTCF protein binding to the insulator, resulting in expression of the paternal <em>IFG2</em> gene from the upstream H19 enhancer. The maternal region is methylated, leading to the H19 expression and CTCF binding to the insulator, blocking expression of the maternal <em>IFG2 </em>gene. The IGF2 silencing is proportional to H19 expression. Both <em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> genes are proto-oncogenes overexpressed in various cancers.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imprinting abnormalities in chr11p15 cause the Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome with overgrowth in various tissues and increased risk of cancers. The latter is caused by abnormal methylation of maternal DNA, causing the maternal <em>IGF2</em> gene expression additionally to the paternal one. The <em>IGF2 </em>overexpression in cancers is often combined with the silencing of the tumour suppressor<em> CDKN1C</em> gene, which is normally regulated by DNA methylation of the maternal <em>KCNQ1</em> region, blocking the KCNQ1 lncRNA expression to allow the <em>CDKN1C</em> expression.</p>
<p>Thus, the paternal DNA methylation pattern in the maternal chr11p15 predisposes to cancers and is inherited maternally.</p></div>
