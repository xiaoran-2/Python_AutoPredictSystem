    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, which is the addition of a methyl group to carbon 5 of the cytosine at a CpG dinucleotide, is a very stable epigenetic mark for controlling gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. CpG islands, which often surround the promotors of "housekeeping genes" like tumor suppressor genes, usually remain unmethylated and thus maintaining these related genes in active state.</p>
<p>As normal tissue develops into metastatic tissue, DNA methylation of CpG islands becomes more dense and CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells, where different cancers have different patterns of CpG island hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The CpG islands hypermethylation in metastatic tissue causes silencing of the related genes, e.g. specific tumor suppressor genes. The cancer cell inactivates these tumor suppressor genes epigenetically in a mitotically heritable way and has in addition a competitive advantage to normal tissue by growing faster.</p>
<p>Opposite to the CpG islands, the genome in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is methylated in a normal cell. A main function of hypermethylation in these regions is genomic stability.</p>
<p>Repeats by definition have large regions which are similar. In case of repeats become hypomethylated, their chromatin becomes more open (euchromatin) and as a consequence repeats can align and recombinations can occur. Further, repeats can be activated because of hypomethylation and transpose. This may lead to aberrations like activating surrounding genes. In general, these consequences of genetic instability contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The expression of a small number of genes, like in the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, depends on whether they have been inherited from the father or the mother. One of them, either the materal or the parental allele is silent, while the other is active.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the CTCF protein binds on the unmethylated insulator element, blocking the enhancer from the communication with Igf2. Hence, Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the insulator element is methylated and thus the CTCF protein can't bind. Thus the enhancer is able to communicate with Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated, i.e. the materal allele is also methylated and thus both the paternal and the maternal allele express Igf2, which results in double dose. Igf2 is a growth promotor like many other imprinted genes which are involved in fetal development. The double dose of Igf2 results in tumors occuring usually in children as Igf2 is required for prenatal growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, removing methylation from DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase which results in hypomethylation.</p>
<p>By removing methylation at specific locations like CpG islands, it is possible that the tumor cells can express tumor suppressor genes again and slow down growth to normal cell growth. As a consequence, tumor cells would ideally turn back into normal cells by restoring normal gene expression and the tumor would also not re-occur in case of cell division since restored epigenetic marks are inherited.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The impact of epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation is heritable and thus epigenetic restorage persists beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, the epigenome is actively remodelled. There are two main sensitive periods, one from the primordial germ cell to the production of mature eggs and sperms. The second period is from the preimplantation to the early post-implantation.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, the environment has the greatest effect on epigenetics. Treatments may have various impacts on epigenetic reprogramming which would not be the case in non-sensitive periods of epigenetic maintenance. They could prevent certain maternal or paternal imprints which need to be set during reprogramming. In general, this could lead to severe consequences for the organism.</p></div>
