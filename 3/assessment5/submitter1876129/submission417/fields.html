    <h1>Submission 417 from Anon (session_user_id: 9a67fd7845be58fb77997c4f4c34d43263773ac4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), that is, it inhibits the molecules that perform DNA methylation. It is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA upon DNA replication. These nucleosides are special in that they permanently trap the DNMTs that bind to them. As a consequence, they gradually deplete the available DNMT molecules in a cell, which results in an overall decrease in DNA methylation. DNMTi drugs have been approved for haematological cancers, for which a correlation between CpG island hypermethylation and poor prognosis has been shown. It is thus possible that these types of cancer depend on such hypermethylation, which would mean that dampening DNA methylation would disrupt these cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found in the promoters of genes. DNA methylation of such CpG islands is associated with silencing of the gene. In a normal cell, these CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, meaning the gene can be transcribed at normal levels. In cancer cells, on the other hand, the CpG islands found in promoters tend to be hypermethylated, inhibiting transcription of the genes under this promoter's control. This can contribute to a tumour's proliferation when tumour suppressor genes are silenced in this way: Tumour suppressor genes are involved in functions such as growth control, initiation of apoptosis and proper DNA repair. Accordingly, the disruption of these genes can result in excessive growth, accumulation of further mutations across cell divisions, or failure to initiate apoptosis.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, methylation as seen in a normal cell serves to silence repeats, transposons, and cryptic promoters. In a cancer cell, these intergenic regions and repetitive regions tend to be hypomethylated, meaning that these elements are no longer silenced and become active. Activation of repeats can lead to erroneous recombination of repeat regions in different parts of the genome through illegitimate pairing of these repeat regions. Disruption or modification of gene products can occur when transposons become activated and are integrated within other genes, or when cryptic promoters become active. All these events can, again, lead to the disruption of tumour suppressor genes, which promotes tumour development as described above.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the Igf2/H19 cluster, the ICR is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The ICR, if unmethylated can be bound by the insulator CTCF. When this insulator is bound, the enhancer downstream of Igf2/H19 is prevented from acting on Igf2; thus, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. The methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele prevents CTCF from binding. The enhancer is free to act on Igf2, which leads to expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the Igf2/H19 ICR is methylated on both the maternal and paternal allele. CTCF can bind to neither of the two alleles, resulting in expression of Igf2 from both alleles and thus a double dose of Igf2. The product of Igf2 is a growth promoter; a double dose results in excessive growth - a characterizing feature of tumour tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks is maintained and propagated across cell divisions through the action of DNA methyltransferases, some of which act on hemimethylated DNA and copy the DNA methylation marks over to the newly synthesized strand. Interventions that alter the epigenome can therefore potentially affect all progenitors of cells present at the time of treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in epigenetics is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are removed and subsequently reestablished genome-wide. One such period occurs during early embryonic development (EED), until around the time of implantation of the blastocyst into the uterus. Another occurs during primordial germ cell (PGC) development.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to expose patients to epigenetic drugs during these periods since these are the periods when such drugs would be associated with a high risk of death or severe disease for the developing individual (in the case of EED) or for their offspring (in the case of PGC development). Specifically, this means that epigenetic therapy would be highly inadvisable for women in the early stages of pregnancy.</p></div>
