    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code">In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated  and DNA methylation cannot be found in CpG islands. But when the normal cell becomes a cancer one, more CpG island are methylated than usual. This phenomenon is called CGI hypermethylation.</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"> </p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">DNA methylation at CpG islands is asociate with tumour suppressors(a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer).The mechanism of happening of deseases is a cancer cell can make tumor suppressor genes inactivated. Cancer cell could do that genetically or epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in acyl in active state. And since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this means that this is a very good locking down mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing. According to Knudson hypothesis, tumor regenesis may happen when both copies of the tumor suppressor or both copies of the tumor suppressor and infections of other hits(e. g. activation of uncle gene) silenced. CpG island methylation progresses with time. When time passing by, as the cancer progresses, methylation level of CpG islands increases and makes tumour suppressors silenced,as a result, cancer happens.</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"> </p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">Unlike CpG islands, <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</span> in genomes are methylated in normal cell while being hypomethylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause genomic instability for the reasons such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transponsable elements. It brings about deletions, reciprocal traslocation, insertions, duplications to make karyotypes abnormal. Finally, mutations of the karyotypes turn normal cells into cancer ones.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Paternal allele and <span>maternal allele show different methylation paterns. </span></span>In period of gamete, Both of them stand the same level of methylaton(highly methylated). But paternal allele becomes demethylate<strong> more rapidly</strong> than maternal allele until the period of blastocyst (both in the lowest level).Then they have a same trend during period of epiblast (become increasingly methylated) and primordial germ cell (demethlated again). Another difference occur since a female's oocytes do not undergone complete maturation and they actually completely mature <strong>a little later</strong> than sperm do. so an offset of time happened because maternal genome become methylated later than paternal one.</p>
<p>CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.The imprinted control region of maternal allele is unmethylated,binding a CTCF, and makes Igf2 <strong>insulated and unexpressed</strong>. Yet, the imprinted control region of Paternal allele is methylated and without binding CTCF This means  Igf2 <strong>expressed </strong>in patern allele.<span> </span><span>H19 is <strong>only transcribed from the maternal allele</strong>; the paternal H19 allele<strong> is not expressed</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Wilm’s tumour is caused by </span>loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of those geno suppress genes,for <span>H19/Igf2 cluster,</span> <strong>overdove of </strong><span><strong>Igf2</strong> is a main factor of that disease.And Increased H19 expression causes other cancers</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent</span>. It belongs to DNA-demethylating<span style="font-size:12px;line-height:0px;"> </span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferrase 1.</p>
<p>Molecular mechanism of how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect is that Decitabine is able to cause degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in cancer cells.That will cause the silenced (methylated) tumour supressor genes return to activated(hypomethylated). Finally the tumours inhibited by tumour supressor genes.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike traditional <span>chemotherapies, <span>epigenetic drugs have longer <span>enduring effects since </span></span></span>DNA methylation, one of the main mechanisms of epigenetic therapies, is mitotically heritable on the epigenome. That will cause a long effect on genome and a consecutive effect on tumour cells. Long-range epigenetic silencing, or  long-range epigenetic activation contributes to the enduring effect of that drugs.</p>
<p><span>Sensitive period is a period of time patient are sensitive for the side-effect of drugs. Two main sensitive period :one is period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms(<strong>from primordial germ cell to gamete</strong>). The second sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period(<strong>from gamete to epiblast</strong>) .</span></p>
<p>An example is that younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells in sensitive periods. Also, early pregancy(3 weeks to 3 months after fertilization) is a hazardous period for preganant women to have drugs because of their fetuses. The reason for why periods of development(3 weeks to 3 months after fertilization) sensitive is that organogenetic period of fetus happened。</p>
<p><span><span>It is unwisely for early preganant woman use drugs which can cause their babies deformed.</span></span></p></div>
