<p> </p>
<p>- CpG islands that are found in 60% of promoters are usually kept free from DNA methylation independant of their activity state.<br /><br />- In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated.<br /><br />- This disruption contributes to disease because it causes silencing of the underlying gene, ( in cancer it is tumor suppressor gene). And since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is a very good locking down mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing.<br /><br />- Normally, inergenic reigons and repetitive elements are methylated, so they are densely packaged and not available for recombination.<br /><br />- In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, and if you have hypomethylation of the  repeats then either they jump or they just have their promoters becoming active, then this can lead to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions. The overall outcome is that you have additional deletions in cancer, you have insertions so you gain parts of chromosomes. <br />And you even have these reciprocal translocations. So, in general genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />It is methylated on the paternal allel, and It is unmethylated on the maternal allel.<br /><br />When it is unmethylated, CTCF 4 binds insulator element, and it means that  the enhancers  will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we do not see expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, with loss of imprinting and what happened is we have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. On the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what in  a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />- Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br /><br />- It hypomethylates DNA (i.e reduces methylation)<br /><br />- They are nucleoside analogue that bind irreversibly to DNA methyletransferase, and this is division dependent .. So it can not be released then, causing hypome thylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- It lasts because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they don't return.<br /><br />- Sensitive period is a period at early development of hightened epigentic sensitivity. Also known as (critical period). Inwhich epigenetic reprogramming takes place. We need to keeop in mind that  younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells,  for example, in sensitive periods. We should remember about the sensitive period so that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. Treating patient in these periods may alter the epigenitic state of the cells and create aberrations, and we know that epigenetic alteration cause genetic aberrations and cancer. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable.<br /><br /></p></div>
