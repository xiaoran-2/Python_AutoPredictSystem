    <h1>Submission 1350 from Anon (session_user_id: ecf3ea1be8fa8f98832a3451cb499104de89386f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable; also, cancerous cells tend to display stem cell-like epigenetic marks. It may be expected that changes in genome methylation (and therefore gene expression) due to medication may persist in the cancerous cell line, such as more sensitivity towards certain drug. As an example, we can recall how the hypermethylation of MGMT affects the reaction of glioma to temozolomide.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In an epigenetic context, a "sensitive period" refers to a range of time in which epigenetic modifications are actively set around the genome. Embryonic development and germ cell differentiation are usually mentioned as the two most important events related to epigenetic sensitivity, as most of the epigenetic marks are removed or changed. The epigenetic changes underlying these periods are subtle and not entirely understood; however, it can lead to death or impairment of the organism involved. Therefore, it is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive times, as the drugs can overhaul the necessary epigenetic changes and result in a wide range of unexpected consequences. If a mother is treated during early pregnancy, for example, the product might die, or suffer enough damage as to predispose it to its own set of diseases later in life.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two main epigenetic alterations that lead to cancer: hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, and hypomethylation of tumor enhancer elements, such as oncogenes and repetitions.</p>
<p>Normally, the CpG (cytosine-guanine) islands in the genome are protected from methylation, as they act as gene promoters, directing the expression of the genome around them. In cancer cells, the trend reverts, with some CpG islands being hypermethylated (and therefore shut down); these are mostly tumor suppressor genes, which need to be deactivated in order to allow cancer growth. Hypermethylation is usually one of the first crucial changes that lead to cancer.</p>
<p>In other cancers, the opposite happens: some parts of the genome are hypomethylated, which results in loss of stability and activation of oncogenes. In cancers, most of the mutations are located in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, which are usually suppressed to avoid relocation of transposons around the genome and abnormal transcriptional activity. Oncogenes are also normally suppressed, as they directly enhance neoplasias. </p>
<p>When repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated, they become activated and begin to be expressed. As a result, the genome grows unstable and chaotic, and loses functionality. Usually, the cell and its lineage will grow increasingly abnormal, until a cancer finally sets.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted. The maternal cell blocks the expression of Igf2 via CTCF, a transcriptional repressor that binds to a domain lying between Igf2 and its enhancers. Therefore, the enhancers cannot continue upstream to activate Igf2, effectively suppressing it.  </p>
<p>However, the binding of CTCF depends on the methylation of its domain and the nearby H19, which also stands between Igf2 and the enhancers. In the paternal allele, both the domain and H19 are methylated. With nothing blocking their path, the enhancers are free to activate Igf2, expressing it.</p>
<p>The normal functioning of the cluster depends on the correct imprinting of the alleles. In Wilm's tumour, however, this imprinting fails and both alleles express Igf2 (as both show methylated CTCF domains and H19's). The silencing of both H19 codes induces cell replication and growth, as H19 is a tumor suppressor element. Eventually, it may cause malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMTi class of epigenetic inhibitors. It mainly targets DNMT and binds with it, effectively disrupting DNA methylation. Because DNMT is the main agent behind <em>de novo </em>DNA methylation, the drug avoids silencing of tumor suppressor genes, one of the main causes of cancer. However, Decitabine is not cancer-specific, and may cause other unseen side-effects in healthy cells; also, it is replication-dependent.</p></div>
