    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>In cells, methylation can occur at the level of clustered CpG dinucleotides, concentrated at promoters of genes : CpG islands. When methylated, promotor attached to CpG island won't lead to expression of following gene. </span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Methylation at CpG islands plays a structural role for chromatin, a role in chromosomic stability, and is also necessary to determine and maintain different cell types during development and life time. </span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is useful to silence repeats, to avoid interferences from strong promoters, and by compacting DNA it will avoid transposition and prevent illegitimate recombination.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In cancer, DNA methylation appear to be impaired :</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>- There can be hypermethylation at the level of CpG islands, in a locus specific manner, and sometimes at shore regions adjacent to CpG islands. Hypermethylation will, in addition of other factors, <em>directly or indirectly</em> give rise to cancer by inactivating tumor suppressors genes, or promoting activity of growth factors. It can be by a direct way (inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene by hypermethylating his promotor), or an indirect way (inactivation of a gene that, in cascade, will let a tumorgenesis factor be expressed).</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>- There can be genome-wide, global hypomethylation, at the level of repetitive elements, intergenic regions, poor promotors CpGs, and regions flanking genes. Losing methylation will disrupt DNA structure, allowing DNA to be less densely strained, and in consequence leading to illegitimates recombinations between repetitive elements, resulting in genomic instability and finally leading to cancer. Moreover, hypomethylation of poor promotors CpGs will activate associated genes, leading indirectly to alteration of tumor suppressors or of growth factors.</span></p>
<p><span>More generally, and in addition to genetic factors and DNA instability, both alterations injures globally expression of DNA, on multiple loci, making DNA to gain repressive marks or lost activation marks, finally leading to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Imprinted control region (ICR) are regions of genome that are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, meaning that only one of the two parental alleles is methylated. Generally, ICR impairment will directly or indirectly leads to expression of growth factor genes, or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>For example, localized near H19 promotor (a long noncoding RNA) exist a paternally imprinted region.</span></p>
<p><span>On both parental alleles exist enchancers that are able to bind Igf2 (a growth factor) or H19 to enhance their expression (DNA makes loops, binding enhancers preferentially to Igf2). </span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>On the <strong>maternal</strong> allele, CTCF (an insulator protein) will bind unmethylated ICR and protect Igf2 from downstream enchancer, avoiding expression of Igf2. Therefore, enhancers will bind to H19 that will be express.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>On the methylated <strong>paternal</strong> allele, enhancers cannot bind to ICR, and will instead bind to Igf2 an activate it. Moreover, methylation spread from ICR into H19 promotor and silence its expression.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumour, both ICR are methylated, expressing Igf2 on the maternal allele like it does on paternal. Expression of Igf2 is twice what it should be and, producing growth factor in double dose, leads to cells overgrowth and finally Wilm's tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Decitabine is a antineoplastic, antimetabolite and demethylation agent, mainly used to treat melodysplastic syndrome (MDS). MDS have genetic bases, and also an aberrant pattern of epigenetics hypermethylations on more than a thousand genes, including suppressor tumor genes.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Decitabine is a cytosine nucleotide analog, that have an effect on DNA methylation by inhibition of DNA-methyltransferase-1. This way, after mitoses (it is cell-cycle dependent : around 3 and up to 9), decitabine allow DNA demethylation, and so reactivation of silenced genes, leading to re-expression of tumor suppressors, and finally helping to cure this specific cancer.</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Nevertheless, over the last decades decitabine has been mainly used in high doses. At high doses, decitabine have a cytotoxic effect that could hypothetically and partially explain some effects of this drug on cancer. </span></p>
<p><span>Still, recent research shown that tumor-suppressor effects of decitabine where present even at low dose, and without cytotoxic effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Research led by Baylin and collaborators shown that using drugs targeting epigenetic factors (like decitabine and azaticine) on cancer cells resulted in simultaneous and sustained modifications in many tumor signaling pathways : return of normal apopostis, downregulation of cell cyling, and many more. </span></p>
<p><span>How ?</span></p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Epigenetic treatment modify gene expression without modifying DNA sequence. Resulting epigenetic modifications, by definition, are mitotically heritable, meaning that they are maintained with cell division.</span></p>
<p><span>With DNA demethylation drugs, cancer cells don’t dye but are reprogrammed. After cell divisions, a new gene expression appear, a new phenotype with normal cell maturation, normal division, and interestingly for cancer a normal anti-tumor reaction.</span></p>
<p><span>Cells returned to a normal epigenetic state, and are maintained in it.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>There are still some cautions, specifically for pregnant women who should not use such drugs : indeed, sensitive periods exist almost exclusively during foetal period, more precisely during pre-emplantation, early post-implantation and primordial germ cells development periods.</span></p>
<p><span>At this stage, epigenome is actively remodelled : patterns of DNA methylation of the foetus is under construction. If demethylating drugs perturb this process, phenotype of the baby will be strongly impaired, and also the next generation because of germ cells impairments during their development.</span></p></div>
