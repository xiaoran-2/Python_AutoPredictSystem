    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the CpG islands are often promotors of tumor suppressor genes. These need to be active, so they are normally hypomethylated. In cancer cells, the CpG islands tend to get methylated. This means they will be silenced. When this happens, the tumor suppression does not function anymore and so tumors are able to grow.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause genomic instability unless methylated, and so in normal cells they are methylated to silence them. In cancer cells, this methylation will get removed, so the regions become active. This can cause transpositions and illegitimate recombinations, as well as activation of  genes that are normally silent. Cancer cells will profit from this genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, that is, it will help demethylate DNA. It does so during cell division, so it will work stronger on cancer cells than on normal cells, as cancer cells tend to divide more.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine will help when the tumour is (partly) caused by methylation of DNA. Such methylation may, for instance, silence tumour suppressors. When Decitabine removes methylation from the DNA in such cells, the tumour suppressors become active again.</span></p>
<p>Not all tumours respond well to demethylating, in fact some may worsen because of greater genome instabilty. This depends on the type and stage of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, H19 functions as a tumour suppressor, while Igf2 enhances growth. In between H19 and Igf2, there is an ICR. This ICR can be methylated or not. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">On the same gene as this cluster, there are enhancers. These enhancers preferentially work on Igf2, but if they can't reach Igf2 they will work on H19 instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">If the ICR is unmethylated, a complex will bind to it that will prevent the enhancers working on Igf2, so they will work on H19 instead. This is the case in a normal maternal allele.</span></p>
<p>If the ICR is methylated, the complex can't bind to it and the enhancers will pass by H19 to work on Igf2 instead. This is the case in a normal paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on both alleles, so effectively there are two paternal alleles. This has a twofold effect: H19 is underexpressed so tumours don't get suppressed, and Igf2 is overexpressed so growth is overstimulated. Both effects enable the formation and proliferation of tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, that is, daughter cells of cells that had their methylation pattern changed will have the same changes in their methylation pattern, unless the methylation actively gets removed. This means DNA methylation changes can last through the lifetime of a person.</p>
<p>There are two periods where epigenetic marks such as methylation get changed: during the formation of germ cells, and during the early formation of the embryo. These are called sensitive periods. In these periods methylation is first removed and then re-applied to the DNA. The formation of germ cells starts in the embryo and goes on through childhood.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that change DNA methylation during sensitive periods means germ cells and embryonic cells may not get the right epigenetic marks. This has no direct consequences for the patient, but her/his children will be affected and might get diseases through over/underexpression of genes or through increased genomic instability.</p></div>
