    <h1>Submission 1755 from Anon (session_user_id: 790dbf237a3e1ff09b8a6313d3515b6d00fdbfe7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to decrease or silence expression of associated genes, although CpG island methylation is uncommon in normal cells. In cancer, CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes become hypermethylated. Tumor suppressor genes function to prevent abormally high division and growth rates, so when they are silenced by hypermethylation of their CpG islands, a tumor may form. </p>
<p>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation serves to stabilize the genome by preventing aberrant recombination between unlike chromosomes. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability due to possible similarity of unmethylated repeats across different chromosomes. These hypomethylated regions can cause reciprocal translations, deletions and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal H19 imprint control region is imprinted and therefore methylated. Methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR, allowing enhancers to bind to the Igf2 gene, increasing expression. Igf2 is therefore expressed mainly from the paternal chromosome. The maternal allele for the H19 control region is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, which acts as an insulator against the enhancers and thus decreases the expression of Igf2 from the maternal chromosome.</p>
<p>Imprinting disruptions in which both chromosomes act as paternal chromosomes lead to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which predisposes children to Wilm's tumor. Imprinting can be disrupted by insertions or deletions at the imprint control region, or by uniparental disomy. Disrupting <span>imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can upregulate Igf2, which can lead to cancer. It can also lead to low expression of Igf2, which may slow and/or stunt the growth of the individual.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor which serves to inhibit the methylation of DNA. It can have an anti-tumor effect by irreversibly binding DNMT and thus inhibiting the methylation of tumor suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome if the methylation or demethylation is mitotically heritable (i.e. if DNMT1 is not compromised). Therefore, epigenetic drugs can have lasting effects. Even so, such drugs should not be used during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is one that is susceptible to environmental influence, and two such periods occur in human development: gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. Treating patients <span>during sensitive periods would be inadvisable due to the large amount of epigenetic reprogramming going on at these stages. Epigenetic drugs may very well interfere with vital processes in the sensitive periods and lead to defects in resultant children.</span></p></div>
