    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG dinucleotides usually ogranised in clusters, CpG islands, which are mostly situated at promoter of genes. In normal somatic cell CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, except of poor promoters. Hypomethylation of CpG islands at promoter site allow to transcription factors to bind to DNA and leads to expression of gene. Hypermethylation of CpG islands inhibit binding of transcription factors and leads to silencing of gene, it is associated with heterochromatin. In cancer genome-wide hypomethylation is observed, while CpG islands are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation at CpG islands in cancer occurs in tumor suppressor genes, which are responsible for control of cell division, apoptosis etc. Their silencing leads to disruption of normal cell division. Hypermethylation is also meet in CpG islands shores, and even more strongly associated with cancer. It is 2kb regions surrounding CpG islands. In some tumors specific sets of genes were found to be hypermethylated, they were described as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIPM).</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic and repetitive elements are hypermetylated in normal somatic cell. In cancer these regions are usually hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions reflects genome-wide hypomethylation. It leads to opening of chromatin, overexpression of genes from these locuses, and also genome instability. Genome instability leads to occurrence of mutations, as methylated CpG nucleotides are prone for mutations. Methylation at repeats can lead to chromosome aberrations: translocations, deletion, isertion, which usually observed in cancer. Hypomethylation at repeats probably can contribute to changes in expression of particular non coding RNA, like pRNA which is also disrupted in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is imprinted gene. It means that it is expressed from one allele only and it is heritable pattern. In normal cell it is expressed from paternal allele only. Its expression is controlled by imprint control region (ICR), <em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2 </em>cluster, which is situated in human chromosome 11. In normal cell this ICR is hypermethylated in paternal allele and hypomethylated in maternal allele. Hypomethylation of ICR at maternal allele allows binding of insulator protein (CTCF) and insulates Igf2 from enhancers which are necessary for its promotion. Igf2 do not expressed from maternal allele in this case. Hypermethylation of ICR at paternal allele spreads to H19 gene which is strong promoter. It leads to silencing of H19 and decreased expression of enhancers. Enhancers work in cis leading to normal expression of Igf2 from paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor both ICR, maternal and paternal, are methylated, it leads to overexpression of Igf2 as it expressed from both alleles. Dose of Igf 2 is increased in this case. Taking into account that Igf2 is a growth factor it leads to overgrowth which is common in tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is non selective DNA methyltranspherase (DNMT) inhibitor, it is also can be described as drug that affect epigenome - epigenetic drug. It is a nucleoside (cytidine) analogue which incorporates into DNA and irreversibly binds DNMT and protects from DNA methylation. It is dependant from cell division, thus effect of Decitabine is greater in those cells which are dividing like cancer cells. As in cancer cells there is an increased methylation in tumor supressors it is supposed (and was proven in studies) that demethylation should increase expression of tumor suppressor genes and decrease growth and prolipheration in these cells. Its positive effect was shown in myelodisplastic syndrom. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is changed in tumor cells in different ways, including CpG islands hypermethylation, poor promoters, repeats, intergenic regions hypomethylation. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus it transmitts to the daughter cells after each division. It means that drugs which affect DNA methylation can act beyond the period of drug treatment. It is important not to alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods, when most epigenomic marks are cleared. Such periods are: pre implantation stage of embryogenesis and develompment of germ cells. During preimplantation stage only imprinted genes and repeates are not demethylated, while during germ cell development only imprinted genes are methylated. Alteration of DNA methylation during these periods may lead to changes in repeats or imprinted genes methylation which are responsible for grows and tumorogenesis. Changes in DNA methylation during germ cell development may lead to pathologic changes in epigenome and/or diseases that will transmit to the next generations. </p></div>
