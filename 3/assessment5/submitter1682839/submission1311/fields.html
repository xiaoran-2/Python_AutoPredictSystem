    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In case of cancer two major alternations appear in DNA methylation pattern: locus-specific hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>    In normal cells DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing those elements of genome and formation of heterochromatin. In case of cancer some CpG islands are always hypermethylated. Usually it happens in tumor suppressor genes promoters. Silencing of this genes increases frequency of cell division. Formation of CpG islands shores of hypermethylation  is typical for cancer. It means that methylation spreads to neighbouring CpG islands, and correlates well with gene expression just like in normal tissue. This shores are better predictors of tumorigenesis than CpG islands methylation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>    In case of hypermethylation and hypomethylation in ICRs, loss of imprinted state occurs. Therefore, maternal and paternal alleles are both at the same time either silenced or active. It is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues. It is important because most of imprinted genes are involved in growth. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>    Comparing normal tissue with tumor tissues we can see that intragenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated or hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability in general. It allows repetitive elements to copy themselves and spread wide the genome. Illegitimate recombination can also happen between repetitive elements.  As consequence of hypomethylated state ("open chromatin"), both deletions, insertions and transpositions can occur. Hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters leads to activation of oncogenes and cryptic promoters or both contemporaneously.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>At the paternal allele ICR is normally methylated and enhancers interact with Igf2 which leads to Igf2 expression.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>    At the maternal allele ICR is normally unmethylated and insulator (CTCF) binds to this region. It allows enhancers to interact with H19 which leads to H19 expression.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>    In case of Wilms syndrome hypermethylation of ICR occurs, which leads to overexpression of Igf2 as consequence of losing imprinted state.  Methylation of ICR on both maternal and paternal alleles causes expression of double dose of Igf2 which is promotes growth. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. And this drug is the most effective in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine as DNMTi gets incorporated into DNA during replication and binds to nucleotide, as consequence DNMT binds irreversibly and cannot be released. Action of DNMTi is division dependent. This means that cancer cells which divide more rapidly will be affected more strongly. They </span><span>are </span><span>probably strik</span><span>ing</span><span> all dividing cells, so long-term consequences </span><span>are </span><span>still unknown. </span><span>By</span><span> using this drug in very low doses </span><span>one </span><span>can reduce negative effect on normal cells and it is supposed that it will “kill” only tumor cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Alteration of DNA methylation may have various effects on epigenome, gene expression and genome stability. It highly depends on where this alterations occurs. This can lead to overexpression or silencing of some genes, losing of imprinted state, activation of mobile elements and genomic instability in general.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>They are two sensitive periods: first epigenetic resetting at blastocyst stage and resetting in primordial germ cells development. Also we know that not only mothers behavior and diet  takes influence on epigenetic state but our grandmothers too, because of PGC resetting. Sensitive periods in epigenetic sense means periods when epigenetic resetting occurs and external factors have influence on new epigenetic pattern. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods can lead to irreversible alterations of DNA methylation. Which can lead to unpredictable consequences on gene expression and genome stability. <span>And this alterations can be inherited through the gametes.</span><br /></span></p></div>
