    <h1>Submission 1433 from Anon (session_user_id: c40b66c4a7d6f9c1adbceed61538bc262a1bf1da)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine belongs to the class of drugs- DNA methyl transferase inhibitors which targets DNA methyl transferase. it is a nucleoside analogue which gets incorporated into the DNA on replication and binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferase leading to their depletion inside the cell. it however depends on the cell proliferation for its activity, hence more effective in rapidly multiplying cancer cells</p>
<p>it causes drug induced reduction of DNA methylation or hypomethylation of the promoter regions(CpG islands), which contains the tumour supressor genes which may be hypermethylated in the cancer cells.they reverse gene methylation,allowing normal transcription to resume.</p>
<p>it causes growth inhibition and anti-tumour effect in cancer cells by activating tumor suppressor genes aberrantly silenced in cancer. also its effect depends on the dose and the levels of methylation. it is effective in hematological malignancies where more than often mutations in the DNMT is seen</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.if DNA methylation at the CpG islands occurs, it causes silencing of gene expression or inactivation of the genes. it is essential for number of processes like X inactivation,supression of repetitive elements and imprinting</p>
<p>2.CpG islands at promoters are normally unmethylated and associated with promoters of tumour supressor genes. However the hypermethylation of CpG promoter islands and CpG island shores causes the inactivation and silencing of  tumour suppressor genes. Loss of tumor suppressor gene function in cancer has been most classically associated with mutations causing genomic instability</p>
<p>3.when hypermethylation  occurs within the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene this can silence expression of the associated gene and provide the cell to proliferate, which is similar to deletions or mutations. also disruption of methylation at ICR causes over expression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>4,.the normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic region(hypermethylated) is to maintain genomic integrity--lack of methylation or hypomethylation results in deletions, reciprocal trnslocations, insertions and duplications.</p>
<p>at the repetitive elements(hypermethylated) also it functions to maintain genomic integrity by protecting the genome from transposable elements.it causes silencing of the repeats to prevent transposition and abberent recombinations</p>
<p>5.in the cancer cells the intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated affecting the genomic stability.</p>
<ul><li>it causes activation of repeats and their transposition.</li>
<li>activation of CpG poor promoters(activation of oncogenes)</li>
<li>disruption/activation of neighbouring genes.</li>
<li>illegitimate combinations between the repeats.</li>
</ul><p><span><span>6.disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease by </span>increasing transcription from transposable elements and increasing genomic instability</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>DNA methylation is one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic events taking place in the genome. This change, though mitotically and meiotically heritable, is reversible.</span>It is through epigenetic marks that environmental factors like diet, stress, smoking,drugs and prenatal nutrition can make an imprint on genes that is passed from one generation to the next. genomic imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at the Imprint control Region. </span></p>
<p>2.they are defined as periods where the epigenetic marks are actively remodelled or erased and reset. these are the periods which are quiet sensitive to environmental influences wherein the environment can influence the epigenetic control.</p>
<p>3.sensitive periods of development-primordial germ cell development</p>
<p>                                                      early develoment(preimplantation and early post implantation peroid of zygote)</p>
<p>4.treating patients with drugs during sensitive periods may inactivate or alter the epigenetic machinery causing transgenerational epigenetic abnormalities.this may cause diseases or cancer predisposition in the offspring. eg DES</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>genomic imprinting is parent of origin specific monoallelic gene expression.</p>
<p><em>IGF2</em><span> and </span><em>H19</em><span> are two imprinted genes located adjacent to each other. <span>In  </span><em>IGF2</em><span> gene, only the paternally inherited allele is expressed while the maternal allele is silent </span><span>. The </span><em>H19</em><span> gene is paternally silent while maternally expressed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>on the paternal allele, the ICR is imprinted, CTCF cant bind and hence there is no insulator action. DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it,the enhancers then bind to Igf2 and activate it. only expressed in paternal allele.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>on the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, hence binds to CTCF(insulator protein,insulates igf2 from enhancers). then secondary looping occurs and they act on H19 causing its activation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>it occurs when the maternal allele behaves like paternal allele</span></span></p>
<ul><li>loss of imprinting-due to mutations, deletions</li>
<li>uniparental disomy-both copies being inherited from the father</li>
<li>epigenteic disruption causing loss of imprinting.</li>
</ul><div>this is seen in beckwith wiedemann syndrome which shows a predisposition to wilm's tumour.</div>
<p><span><span>in wilm's tumour,there is loss of imprinting and hypermethlation of ICR on both paternal and maternal alleles.<span>methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, </span> causing over expression of Igf2 which promotes cell growth tumorogenesis. it is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</span></span></p>
