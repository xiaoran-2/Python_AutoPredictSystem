    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation in healthy mammalian cells is to allow transcriptional activity to take place, there being an inverse relationship between the two. ThIs allows normal cellular functions to take place and maintains homeostasis.  DNA methylation occurs only at CpG di-nucleotides, these often forming clusters - CpG islands - located near to or in gene promoters, where binding sites for transcription activating factors reside. </p>
<p>CpG islands are usually un-methylated in healthy cells, but when methylation does occur through some internal or external agent (e.g. virus or carcinogen), it reduces expression of the associated genes by blocking their transcription factor binding sites and condensing the chromatin structure in that vicinity (heterochromatin). </p>
<p>The silencing of tumour-suppressing genes allows a possible pathway to uncontrolled cell proliferation.  Additionally, methylation of CpG island 'shores' (DNA regions stretching ~2 kbp either side of the islands) is also found in cancer cells; total methylation of these and the islands - hypermethylation - guarantees gene silencing.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to ensure silencing of any unneeded or extra promoters, enhancers, non-coding RNAs, unidentified genes or gene copies ('repeats') that may reside in these places.  The main effect is to ensure genomic stability, i.e. no loss or gain of chromosomes, aberrant recombinations or random insertions and deletions.</p>
<p>By contrast, in cancer these regions become more de-methylated or hypomethylated than normal, allowing activation of these various elements, especially the repeats, thereby causing catastrophic overexpression of large numbers of inappropriate genes and/or growth factors.  In addition, hypomethylation can be genome-wide, causing overexpression of DNA MethylTransferases (DNMTs) that, in turn, cause localized hypermethylation of CpG islands.  This imbalance of DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer and is being actively pursued in cancer therapeutics.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a parent-of-origin set of epigenetic marks inherited through the germ line.  Disruption of imprinting can cause mis-expression of critical growth factor expressing genes, leading to various forms of cancer and other abnormalities. Each such gene is controlled by the methylation pattern of its Imprint Control Region (ICR).  Normally the paternal allele's ICR is methylated, whereas the maternal one is unmethylated: a differential pattern of imprinted DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The maternal allelle's H19 gene is normally expressed when an Insulator protein (CTCF) binds to its unmethylated ICR, blocking its downstream Enhancers from Igf2 (a growth-promoting gene). Thus Igf2 is not normally expressed by the maternal allelle.</p>
<p>The paternal allele's ICR CpG island is normally already methylated.  This blocks CTCF from binding to the island and inhibits H19 expression by methylation spreading to its promoter region.  Now the Enhancers downstream of H19 can activate Igf2 expression instead.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is caused by a pathological methylation pattern that silences the maternal H19 gene (e.g. via methylation of its ICR) and allows expression of its Igf2 gene. This causes disease by potentially doubling the overall level of Igf2 expression in the early embryo.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome is a pattern of chemical marks on the genome itself that helps determine gene regulation and expression. When disrupted, this pattern may allow incorrect expression leading to disease.</p>
<p>Decitabine affects DNA methylation patterns by irreversible binding to DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs), a protein family that catalyses methyl group attachment to certain histones on the nucleosomes. Thus it is a 'DNMT Inhibitor' class of epigenetic drug.</p>
<p>It induces DNA hypomethylation by forming covalent bonds between itself and the DNMTs already present.  This opens up the chromatin structure to allow either correct cell division or apoptosis (cell death) to take place, depending on the speed of cell replication.</p>
<p>Because Decitabine has differential toxicity (it is more toxic to rapidly dividing cancerous cells than to healthy cells), it needs very careful dosage levels, but has proved highly effective in blood cancer patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal epigenetic DNA methylation is the pattern of attachments of small methyl groups to histones in the chromatin of healthy cells.  This pattern is inherited by all subsequent cell generations or until programmed cell death occurs (apoptosis).  In cancer cells, however, alterations to this methylation pattern are of two types: i)  hypomethylation, which can be genome-wide and ii) hypermethylayion, that silences tumour-suppressing or growth-regulating genes.</p>
<p>Therefore the effects of epigenetic drug treatment (e.g. Decitabine which actively changes a cancer cell's DNA methylation pattern) will be transmitted to daughter, grand-daughter cells and so on . . .   This can be good for adult cancer patients because it allows the therapeutic effects of the drug to 'cascade' on after treatment has stopped. </p>
<p>However, great care is needed for children because their germ cells are still developing: they are in a sensitive period of development when their germ cell methylation patterns are still being established.  Using such a drug for childhood cancer would likely cause changes to these patterns that could result in infertility or further complications in other sensitive periods: during pregnancy, either at very early embryonic development or at mid-gestation when the primordial germ cells start developing.</p>
