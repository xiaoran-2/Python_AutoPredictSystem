    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are usually kept free of DNA methylation independent of their activity state in normal cells. However, <span>in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. This causes silencing of the underlying gene, which could code for tumor suppressors and other products that would normally prevent/suppress cancer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Intergenic region and repetitive elements are generally methylated in normal cells to provide better genomic integrity and stabilily (e.g. prevent redundant reciprocal translocation). In cancer cells, these regions tend to become hypomethylated. This in turn causes genomic instability <span>and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes thus provides an environment for more frequent genetic mutation, lack of DNA repairs etc. that results/enhances tumorgenesis and cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has the imprint control region methylated, which could spread to closer-by H19 gene. This silences H19 expression and allows the downstream enhancers promote Igf2 expression uninterrupted.</p>
<p>The maternal allele has unmethylated imprint control region, which attracts the insulator CTCF protein and forces the downstream enhancers to promote H19 expression instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, both paternal and maternal allele have methylated imprint control region. </p>
<p>The disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster (specifically methylated imprint control region for both paternal and maternal allele) would result in upregulation/overdose of Igf2, a growth promoting oncogene, and loss of Cdkn1c, a growth suppressor. This would in turn cause overgrowth and tumorgenesis (as in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors of <span>DNA-demethylating agents. As the name suggests, Decitabine <span>hypomethylates DNA (by inhibiting DNA methyltrasferase</span>).</span></span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia by reducing hypermethylated epigenome thus allowing<span> the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes</span> and produce an anti-tumour effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylations are mitotically inheritable, thus the effects on epigenome will be preserved for all the daughter cells originated from the initial target as long as no further modification was made (either by the cell or other drugs).</p>
<p>In some periods of development, cell epigenomes are under active restructuring. The state of the DNA methylation would be actively changed even without drugs. Thus additional changes could be unfavorable. Such sensitive periods would include the early (fetal) development and premordial germ cells development when either paternal or maternal allele undergo epigenetic imprints reprogramming.</p>
<p>During these time, cells treated with epigenetic drugs would subject to additional epigenetic changes possibly other than the original imprints. Changes of DNA methylation state on part of the genome would then result in drastically different genes being promoted or silenced or increase genomic instability. For any wrongfully promoted oncogenes or silenced tumor suppressor genes, the risk of cancer and other genomic diseases will certainly increase.</p></div>
