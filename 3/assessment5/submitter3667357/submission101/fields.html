    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Decitabine</em> is a hypomethylating agent.It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine , althouugh Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</p>
<p><em>Decitabine</em> is a cytosine analogue and antineoplastic agent used in therapy of myelodysplastic syndromes.<em>Decitabine</em> is associated with a  low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been implicated in causing clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
<p><em>Decitabine</em> is a pyrimidine analogue (5-aza-deoxy-cytidine)which is the deoxyribose form of 5-azacitidine<em>.Decitidine</em> is converted intracellularly to a triphosphate wich becomes incorporated into DNA and appears to inhibits DNA methylation, resulting in increased expression of silenced genes including tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p><em>Decitabine</em> blocks tumor growth by inducing the silencing of selectve genes of the tumor that head apoptosis of the tumors cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal cell. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation.This causes, on one hand, genomic instability and deregulation of specific tissue and imprinted genes and, on the other hand, silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Interestingly, no global hypomethylation at satellite repetitions could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve death tumors using a genome-wide approach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities.First of all,  there is DNA hypermethylation that is locus-specific, second, there is genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <em><strong>normal</strong><strong> cel</strong><strong>ls</strong> there </em>are <em><strong>hypomethylation CpG Islands. </strong></em>But  the genome in general is <em><strong>methylated</strong></em> in the <strong><em>repetitive elements</em></strong> through the <em><strong>intergenic regions</strong></em> and indeed in the <strong>introns </strong>of genes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast, in general, in <em><strong>cancer cells th</strong></em>e<em><strong> CpG islands</strong> </em>are more likely to be <em><strong>methylated </strong></em>and in the rest of the genome in general including the <em><strong>repetitive elements</strong></em>, the <em><strong>intergenics elements</strong> </em>and  the <strong>introns</strong> are <em><strong>hypomethylated.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>DNA methylation </strong></em><strong></strong>patterns undergo complex changes in cancer.The total amount of methylated cytsine is usually decreced resulting in global hypomethylation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Cancer </strong></em>is caused by failure of checks and balances that control cell numbers in response to the needs of the organism. Inappropriate function of genes that promote or inhibit cell growth or survival can be caused by errors introduced into the genetic code itself or by faulty epigenetic mechanisms deciding which genes can and cannot be expressed. Epigenetic lesions and genetic mutations are acquired during the life of an individual and are cumulative .Both types of events can result in the loss of control over cell growth and develop cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This is example of cancer there is hypermethylation of imprint control regions.Genes that should be displaying monoallelic-parent-origin-specific expression,are genes imprinted are involved in growth.</p>
<p>The Igf2 H19 cluster is the imprint control region and it's methylated on the paternal allele, it's unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When it's unmethylated CTCF is bind to insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19.But Igf2 wil be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see exppression. </p>
<p>On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers.Can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not bindind to insulate this, and Igf2 is expressed from the patter allele .</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour, on the maternal allele, also have expression of Igf2, here it has a double dose of Igf2 in comparision to a normal cell.Igf2 both  promote growth and this is associated with Wilm's tumours.</p>
<p>Specific example loss imprinting is observed in this type of tumour ;so it's often seen in preneoplastic tissue for events of hypermethylation in this context.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered with DNA methyl transferases inhibitors,  but useding very high doses they're just toxic really, but they're been used at much lower doses where is very good anti neoplastic effect and  you are killing the tumours cells.Drogs that produced DNA demethylation do not have any specific effects, there're toxic   ,but can have enduring effects used in the epigenome.Epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddauther cells until they are actively erased.Once erased, though, they do not return.It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods  alterad environment have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are : gametes, fertilised egg, blastocyst, epiblast ,primordial germ cells.</p>
<p>Pre implanted and early post implantation  periods  are in an active remodelling of the genome and are the most sensitive periods to changes in the environment where they were produced in an oocyte a sperm and are very sensitive in the development, therefore, it is not advisable to treat patients during this period.</p></div>
