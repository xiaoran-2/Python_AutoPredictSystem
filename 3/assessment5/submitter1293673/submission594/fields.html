    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the most important function in DNA methylation is genomic stability preservation. Methylation is also crucial to imprinting.</p>
<p><span> </span>CpG islands are normally unmethylated. When hypermethylation is found it is indicative of pathological states - delayed replication, condensed chromatin state, more in general chromatin structure, cancer - when it involves silencing (e.g. of suppressors) - or genomic imprinting, X inactivation.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation of the promoter is associated with malignant progression (by repressing its transcription) and hypomethylation might equally be involved in its development. Hypermetylation in CpG islands is protected by several mechanisms, such as transcription, demethylation and chromatin structure. Repeats are in a way the most important region amongst the alterations - hypermethylation is most commonly found there, which are usually heavily methylated and heterochromatized, in order to prevent aberrant recombination, which would happen in case of alignment of repeats and in general, similarity, and a state of open chromatin, so that DNA is not too coiled to occur. When repetitive elements are hypomethylated, this enables them to duplicate and transpose, which is almost associated to deleterious consequences in the genome (eg Alu elements)</p>
<p>On the other hand, hypomethylation of CpG promoters - poor promoters, which do not have enough density of CpG to be considered a CpG island - is linked with several types of oncogenes, eg. proto-oncogene R-RAS in gastric cancer or hypermethylation of miR21, that underexpress the tumor suppressor PTEN.</p>
<p>Different kinds of cancers have different profiles and patterns of aberrant methylation. If chromosomal instability is the driving force, depleting DNA methylation will only exacerbate the problem. If the cause is suppressor hypermethylation, by demethylating tumorigenesis will also be suppressed. The dependency may change during whilst the tumor progresses, as the methylation pattern will. This can be exploited clinically by considering it a marker.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (DAC) is a DNA-demethylating agent and DNMTs inhibitor, that (often together with <span>azacitidine) is used in the treatment of<span> <span>myelodysplastic syndromes</span>. Because it is a <span>nucleoside analogue, DAC is incorporated into replicating DNA through covalent bonds with DNMTs (Hagermann, 2011).</span> A relative study from Stewart et al (2009) showed that it seems to stimulate proliferation of chemotherapeutic toxicity factors by inducing hypomethylation and augment CTR1 expression. Suh et al (2010) found that it also decreases cortisol secretion and cell invasion and was able to recover expression of silenced genes, thereby making it a possible effective adjuvant therapy in advanced states of the disease. When investigated by Hagemann et al (2011),<span> genome-wide studies also showed that transcriptional downregulation is another effect of decitabine treatment. The study concluded that drug-induced demethylation patterns were demonstrated to be highly specific, with evidence of targeted remethylation upon replication.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, which<span> is transmitted to subsequent cell generations - reprogramming may occurr during gametogenesis and after fertilization (or after artificial reprogramming). Because DNA methylation inhibiting drugs are relatively new and not yet known, their side effects and particularly long term consequences are not known e.g. hitting all dividing cells, having other yet undiscovered effects, not being restricted just to the nucleus,  and wariness is necessary at this stage. Younger patients must be particularly kept in mind as those with eg. germ cells in sensitive periods would be administred a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. This is due to a particular state, termed sensitive period, in which development is extremely sensitive to environment insults, eg. mid gestation; transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is not explain by strictly genetic causes but it can be transmitted through germ cells. In order to have more molecular control of the germline and a lower number of <span>transcriptional alterations and epimutations it would be best to use such drugs on less sensitive patient, at least for the moment.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele - which means the enhancers are able to act on Igf2 because CTCF is not insulating it, and express the paternal allele - and unmethylated on the maternal allele, which means the maternal allele is silenced. If unmethylated, CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, allowing enhancers to act on H19. What disruption and then loss of imprinting can lead to is hypermethylation of the control region of the maternal allele as well, leading to expression of Igf2 also on that allele. It follows a doubled dosage of Igf2 compared to what is considered healthy. Overexpression of Igf2 is linked with Wilm's tumour, a cancer of kidneys almost exclusively found in children - in particular, loss of imprinting in this kind of cancer is associated with loss of maternal allele-specific methylation upstream of the <em>IGF2</em> promoters. The exact mechanism through which this happens is not yet understood.</p></div>
