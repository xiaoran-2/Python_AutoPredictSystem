    <div class="field-value"><p>     The epigenetics mechanisms are controlled changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype that not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence.   The DNA methylation  is one  mechanism which involved the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine  DNA nucleotides altering the expression of genes in cells. DNA methylation also is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin and plays a crucial role in the development of all types of cancer. </p>
<p>    The  CpG island within promoters are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state being less prone to mutational pressure. However, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. The intergenic regions can be responsible for maintain genomic integrity in normal cell and repetitive elements may play role in genome defense (protect from transposable elements) and maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cells, CpG island within promoters tend to become hypermethylated  causing silencing of the underlying  gene. The methylation is established by DNA metil transferase. The DNA methylation can lead to silencing  by two mechanism, when meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression. CpG island hypermethylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, silenced tumour suppressor genes in cancer facilitate cancer cell proliferation.   In contrast occurs the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repeat elements that increasing genomic instability. DNA demethylation can occurs passively, associated with high DNA replication rates, or actively which involve modification of 5 mC via oxidation by the TET family of proteins to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine or via deamination to thymine by AID generating genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, Activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Genomic imprinting  involves DNA methylation and histone modulation in order to achieve monoallelic gene expression without altering the genetic sequence. Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression. At the same time as H19 expression decreases, the expression of IGF2, a neighboring gene on chromosome 11, increases. Thus, the hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele allow the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2 and the hypomethylation of the H19 on the maternal allele governs IGF2 repression of the maternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene. This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers.  In Wilms tumour the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted displaying loss of imprinting. So, you have high hypermethylation of imprint control region on the maternal allele resulting in double dose of lGF2. The lGF2 growth promoting is associated with Wilms tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a hypomethylating agent that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, thus is considered a DNMT (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. Cells in the presence of Decitabine, incorporate this into DNA during replication inhibiting  methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in  sequence. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Cancers cells which are dividing more rapidly than most normal cells will be more affected because there are replicating more. This way, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This way, when we drug treatment alter the DNA methylation the heritability of epigenetic state ensures that this alteration is transferred to daughter cells by cell division generating effects that  last beyond the period of drug treatment. The Sensitive periods are  periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, a period of the epigenetic reprogramming. Clearing or resetting of epigenetic marks occurs in germ cell development and early embryonic development and in a period of maturation of germ cells (younger 8-12 old years). So, the treatment of younger patients with epigenetic drugs (chemical exposure) would be inadvisable because transgenerational epigenetic inheritance still not well understood. The chemical exposure may lead to undesirable effects on their offspring.</p></div>
