    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing and helps to maintain genomic stability. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, because DNA is re-methylated during replication due to the action of DNA methyltransferase. Generally, a small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated across all cell types, while most promoters retain unmethylated status.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, however, this normally stable epigenetic mark is altered in two ways. First, some tumor supressor genes expereince hypermethylation at CpG islands. Which genes expereince hypermethylation varies based on tumor type, such as BRCA1 in breast cancer or MGMT in gliomas and colorectal cancer. Normally, these genes are unmethylated and active - producing proteins (or RNAs) that inhibit excessive cell grown or promote timed cell death. The epigenetic silencing of these tumor supressor genes can cause cells to grow larger than normal or to live past their normal expectancy. DNA hypermethylation in some genes - like MIR-34b1c - are also associated with metastasis of certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>In additon to DNA hypermethylation in tumor supressor genes, genome-wide hypomethylation also occurs in cancer cells. Only a small portion of the genome contains actual genes. The majority of the genome is made up of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which are usually methylated (silenced) in normal cells. Historically, genome-wide hypomethylation is the earliest epigenetic abnormality detected in cancer cells, leading to high genomic instability. As intergenic regions and repeats are demethylated, the resultant cancer cells exhibit more deletions, insertions/duplications, reciprocal translations, and activations of transposons than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer (as well as some other diseases), alterations to the epigenetic state at imprint control regions (ICRs) is a common early event often seen in neoplastic tissues. Alterations (hypo or hypermethylation) at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes (tumor supressors) or overexpression of growth promoting genes (oncogenes).</p>
<p>One example of distruption of imprinting contributing to cancer is the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm's tumor. H19 codes for a long noncoding RNA, while Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene. With the normal imprinting pattern, H19 and Igf2 are each expressed from only one copy. The paternal allele's ICR is methylated, which prevents H19 from being expressed and facilitates Igf2 expression. The maternal allele's ICR, on the other hand, is unmethylated, which allows H19 to be expressed and prevents Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, silencing H19 expression from that allele. An added consequence is that the maternal allele produces Igf2 instead of H19, meaning that Wilm's tumor cells express a double amount of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene (oncogene), overexpression can lead to tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold commercially as Dacogen, is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precoursers to acute myelogenous lukemia (AML). DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA. Once incorporated, epigenetic drugs like decitabine irreversibly bind with DNA methyltransferase "locking" it to the DNA. After DNMTs are bound to the inhibitors in DNA, they are not able to remethylate daughter strands of DNA after replication.</p>
<p>While the exact mechanism of action is still unclear for many DNMT inhibitors, their effect is clear. If DNMT is unable to carry DNA methylation from mother to daughter strands, the amount of DNA methylation in tumor tissues (or any other tissue impacted by the DNMT inhibitor) will reduce over time, diluting the total amount of methylation in that tissue. As replication continues to occur, genes that were previously hypermethylated can return to their previous unmethylated status, allowing tumors to reduce in size.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that cause epigenetic changes - for treatment of cancer or other diseases - have the capability to show effects long beyond the initial treatment period. DNA methylation status, for example, is mitotically heritable, so any changes to DNA methylation will be passed on during cell division to daughter cells. Therefore, drugs that aim to change the amount of methylation in cancer tissues (like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, for example) can have long-lasting effects on tumors without having to kill all cancerous cells in one shot.</p>
<p>There are, however, some periods of development during which treatment with epigenetic-targeting drugs may be inadvisable. Certian sensitive periods exist during which large-scale changes in the epigenome are taking place, and cells are particularly vulnerable to major assaults on the cellular environment. Such sensitive periods include pre-implantation development of the embryo and primordial germ cell development. In younger patients, then, where primordial germ cell development is still occuring, such epigenetic targeting drugs have the potential to effect large-scale changes on not only the patient's cells, but on their germ cells (thus effecting future generations), as the addition of a drug like a DNMT inhibitor certainly constitutes a major insult to the cellular environment.</p></div>
