    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the modification of cytosine at carbon position 5 by adding methyl group through DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a, DNMT3b and DNMT1). Aberrations in DNA methylation are found to be an important mechanism for carcinogenesis. Aberrations in DNA methylation can either be locus specific i.e. at CpG islands or genome wide i.e. in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG islands are often located at the promoters of genes in mammals. In normal cells CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation i.e. they are hypomethylated so that they can be expressed as DNA methylation is inversely correlated with gene expression. However in cancer these CpG islands got hypermethylated silencing the tumor suppressor genes leading to the uncontrolled cell division. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands found to be present frequently in all tumors as they could be heritable mitotically and also these epimutations are rapidly selected which allows the cancer cell to divide more aggressively. In contrast the intergenic regions and repetitive regions are hypermethylated in normal cells to maintain genomic stability. However in cancer cells hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions results in genomic instability. Illegitimate recombination and transposition between the repeats results in abnormal karyotype. Hypomethylation also results in cryptic activation of repeats resulting aberrant transcription. Thus both abnormal karyotype and aberrant transcription contribute to the cancer. Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands or at repeats can be disrupted in cancer by genetic aberrations in these epigenetic modifiers.  Alterations may be due to translocations which activate or deactivate them or through overexpression of their genes. Point mutations are also found commonly in these DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Hence alteration in DNA methylation is among one of the multiple hits which results in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) by aberrant DNA methylation can also contribute to the cancer in locus specific manner. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs could be hypo or hypermethylation. Loss of imprinting is a common early event and often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues. One example of this is the hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells ICR is methylated in paternal allele which does not allow the CTCF, an insulator protein to bind at imprint control region thereby allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2. Hence Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. However in case of maternal allele ICR is not methylated so that CTCF can bind and insulate it which allows the enhancers to bind to H19 and results in its expression but silenced the Igf2 expression from maternal allele. Therefore in normal cell Igf2 is paternally imprinted. Disruption of H19/Igf2 imprinting through hypermethylation occurs in Wilm’s tumor. Hypermethylation results the methylation of ICR also in maternal allele so that Igf2 can be expressed from both the alleles. As Igf2 is growth promoting gene this results in double dose of the protein and development of Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of class of drug known as “DNA demethylating” agents. It is a nucleoside analog i.e. cytidine analog. It irreversibly inhibits the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).  Aberrant DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands results in silencing of “tumor suppressor genes” that regulate cell division and growth. Decitabine is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It works by interfering with the methylation of DNA by inhibiting DNMT resulting in hypomethylation of DNA which may restore normal function of genes that are critical for the cellular differentiation or apoptosis in tumor cells. Also, decitabine incorporates into the DNA during the S phase of cell cycle i.e. during DNA replication that’s why it shows cytotoxicity in rapidly dividing tumor cells while non proliferating cells are relatively insensitive towards it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on epigenome that last beyond the period of drug treatment as unlike other forms of gene expression epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable which are passed on during cell division to daughter and then granddaughter cells. However there are certain periods during which we should avoid treating patients with epigenetic modifiers called as sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are those periods of development during which epigenetic reprogramming occur to clear and then again reset the epigenetic marks for example during early development at pre implantation period and during primodial germ cell development.  Childhood is also considered to be a sensitive period. Therefore treating younger patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive period is not advisable as germ cells are still in development during this and altering the DNA methylation status may have potential implication on fertility and epigenetic state of their offspring.</p></div>
