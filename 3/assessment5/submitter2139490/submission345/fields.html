    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation provides for genomic stability.During cancer there may be hypermethylation of CGI such that it may silence Tumour supressor genes.These TSGs are responsible for the supression of cancerous growth and without their activity the uncontrolled proliferation of affected cells occur.The intergenic regions as well as the repetitive elements in the DNA of a normal cell are methylated to provide for genome stability.Hypomethylation of these regions are seen in case of cancerous growth.THis may be attributed to the activation of oncogenes that were previously silenced by the methylation in the intergenic and repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the ICR is seen in the paternal allele which doesnot allow for the H19 expression as methylation of the region also takes place.This enables the enhancer downstream to act on Igf2 thereby activating its expression.The maternal allele on the other hand is unmethylated at the ICR and bound by CTCF.This enables the enhancer to act on H19 enabling its expression.The Igf2 gene is however silenced and therefore no expression of Igf2 gene is seen.Hence there is equal amount of Igf2 and H19 expression,from paternal and maternal allele respectively.In the case of Wilm's tumour due to loss of imprinting,the maternal allele is also hypermethylated at the ICR and this results in expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele as well.This results in double the dosage of Igf2 which has a role in growth of cells and is responsible for cancerous growth in kidney of children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents or rather DNMTi.These drugs are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind to the DNMT in the replicating cell thereby blocking its action and hence the daughter cells are demethylated.This hypomethylation at the CGI may activate the Tumour supressor genes which would have been silenced in the cancer cells,thereby resulting in supression of cancerous growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed on from parent cell to the daughter cells and so forth untill they are erased due to some imprinting mechanisms.Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects beyond the period of drug administration as these are epigenetic modifications and by definition itself we can understand that they are mitotically heritable.This imolies that once the DNA methylation has been altered,the same will be seen in all its replicating daughter cells.The epigenetic drug treatment is not advisable during certain sensitive periods defined as those periods where active epigenetic marks are being laid or epigenetic reprogramming takes place.These periods include pre pubertal and pubertal periods in females and early gestation periods in embryo development.This is because any epigenetic modifications in the germ line cells will be transmitted to the next generation unlike those seen in somatic cells which are only mitotically heritable.Hence these drugs if used for treatment during the sensitive period can lead to complications in the future offspring.</p></div>
