    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal or healthy cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated allowing the cell to be methylated in the introns of genes, the intergenic region, and in the repetitive elements. However in a cancer cell the CpG islands become hypermethylated disrupting the cell and preventing the methylation of the introns, intergenic region, and the repetitive elements. This change in the DNA methylation can disrupt the alternative to a mutation, which would silence the tumor supressing gene, a key part of cancer prevention. The scilencing of the Tumor suressor gene is just one of the hits needed to cause cancer. With the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes illegitimate recombinations of repeats, resulting in insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations. Over all this effects the stability of the genome adding more hits toward cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the maternal allele has the imprint control region unmethylated allowing it to bond with CTCF, activating the enhansers. The enhansers then act on the H19 gene, leaving the Igf2 gene scilent. With the paternal allele of a healthy cell the imprint control region is methylated, preventing the bond with CTCF. with out that bond the H19 gene becomes methylated, scilencing it. The enhansers are then available to act upon the Igf2 gene, expressing it. However with the Wilm's tumour cell the paternal allele remains the same, but the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated in the imprint control region. Therefore activating the Igf2 gene on both alleles giving the cell an extra dose of Igf2. As Igf2 is growth promoting the cell would have unregulated growth resulting in a cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of DNA-demethylating agents of which Decitabine is a part of is being used to treat syndromes such as <span>myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine allows the demethylisation of alleles in cancer cells, while leaving the normal healthy cells alone. This allows the cancer cell to be unmethylated back into a normal cell. With this theory the cancer cells would all revert back into normals cells, allowing them to die and multiply at a healthy rate reversing the tumor until it is no longer there, the anti-tumout effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By altering the DNA methylation of cells there is a lasting epigenetic effect that remains. This alterations that make the cells more suscepitable to chemotherapy could be mitotically heritable, passing it on to future generations, therefore making the susceptiability last longer than the life time of one cell and changing the epigenome. Sensitive periods, or periods where exposure to enviornments can cause large changes, could be a problem with this treatment. If the treatment were to have major effects if used during one of these sensitive periods that is not yet know it could change the epigenome a great deal. The sensitive periods from primordial germ cell development to the development of mature eggs and sperm as well as the pre-implantation and early post implantation period. Treating patients during this time or treating preagnant women would be inadvisable because during this time there is key reprogaming going on in the cells and the treatment may cause adverse effects and causing more harm than good to the patient.</p></div>
