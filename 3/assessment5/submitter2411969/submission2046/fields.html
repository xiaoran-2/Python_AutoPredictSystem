    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is widely altered in cancer compared to normal cells. </p>
<p>in cancer, most of the genome is generally hypomethylated (including intergenic regions and repeats) while specific regions like certain CpG islands seem to be hypermethylated. </p>
<p>In normal cells however, repeat and intergenic regions are silenced through methylation and are normally part of heterohromatin while active genes have unmethylated CpG islands allowing transcriptional factors unobstructed binding and therefore expression of these important genes. Changes in methylated state of a specific genomic region can lead to a disease in various ways. For example, if a CpG island of a tumor suppressor gene is hypermethylated (and therefore inactivated) it could eventually lead to cancer by not allowing expression of the gene that supresses tumor. Another example is hypomethylation of repeat and intergenic regions that could, by unpacking and structurally changing heterochromatin, lead to genomic instability, illegitimate recombination and eventually cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the characteristic of cancer is the loss of imprinting (parental specific allelic expression).</p>
<p>In normal cells, ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing the CTCF 'insulator' protein to bind to it, therefore the enhancers act on the lncRNA H19 instead of IGF2 (inhibited). ICR of the paterlnal allele is normally methylated allowing enchancers to bind to IGF2 promoter region and this results in expression of IGF2. </p>
<p>In case of Wilm's tumor ICR of both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated resulting in expression of IGF2 from both DNA stands. Since IGF2 is a growth factor, overexpression of this gene can lead to development of cancer.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning that it is involved in elimination of methyl groups from DNA. This drug </span>could have an anti-tumor effect by decreasing the level of methylation in hypermethylated regions of cancer genomes. This demethylation would allow previously inhibited (methylated) tumor supressor genes to be expressed and pehaps revert the process of cancerogenesis.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so it has longterm and transgenerational effects.  </p>
<p>A sensitive period is any developmental phase involving epigenetic reprogramming. This includes passive and active removal of epigenetic marks (to allow oocyte/spermato-genesis) and placement of specific epigenetic marks to generate different sometic cell lineages. These two sensitive perionds are described as <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong> and the <strong>early embrionic development.</strong> </p>
<p>The administration of epigenetic drugs is not advisable in the Early Development and Primary germ cell development due to the delicacy of resetting of epigenetic marks. </p>
