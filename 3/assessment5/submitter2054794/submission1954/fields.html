    <div class="field-value"><p>1)DNA methylation at CpG islands is the most well known epigenetic changes. Methylation doesn't tend to occur at CpG islands,and if it was, this is almost universally synonymous with silencing of gene expression, allowing for transcription of the genes through allowing access of the transcription machinery to the DNA,to maintain genomic integrity and maintain genetic stability.</p>
<p>High frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was relate to cancers.In tumor cells,gene-specific 5′region CpG’s are highly methylated, while the rest of the genome becomes highly unmethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer cells,CpG islands is targeted and hypermethylated, thereby it not only preventing any transcription activators to access the DNA,then causes silencing of the underlying gene,but also activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor supressors genes.This CpG island hypermethylation also attribute to epimutation which help to cancers eventuate.</p>
<p>2) The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity and maintain genetic stability, mutogenic,prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In the case of cancer is that these intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can to DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements,avoid Illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p>In the context of cancer we have high promethylation of these repetative elements or the intergenic regions. The hypomethylation can caused repeats activated,and next repeats make a copy of themselves ,and jump around the genome or transpose. This may disrupt the coding region of a gene and may activate neighboring genes.It also cause caused silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in acyl in active state and transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions. Genomic instability, you tend to see these illegitimate deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-03dcd9e612ed282e6a569294/970238/asst-5/970238-5212da83b69e61.16814771.txt">Q1.txt</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) On the patternal allele, imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind. And if CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2. And promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>2)On the maternal allele,which is bound by a protein called CTCF, which is an insulator protein and can able to insulate CTCF's binding insulate Igf2. From the downstream enhances that he shown as green stars. Because it's insulating IGF2 these enhancers are now free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele so this is thought to happen because of chromatin looping. Though the preferred loop is between the enhancers and IGF two.</p>
<p>3)In Wilm's tumour, loss of imprinting,high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele, you have expression of Igf2 and now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell.(199words)</p>
<p>4) loss of imprinting, hypermethylation. When the ICR is methylated (paternal chromosome) Igf2 is expressed, and when it is unmethylated (maternal chromosome) H19 is expressed.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-03dcd9e612ed282e6a569294/970238/asst-5/970238-5212da8ccb0b68.44326115.txt">Q2.txt</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1)Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent or demethylating agents,it works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>2)Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.Then cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.</p>
<p>3)Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine also as an antimetabolites.Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-03dcd9e612ed282e6a569294/970238/asst-5/970238-5212daa2f22ad0.60659375.txt">Q3.txt</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1)Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.<br />2)To refer to important periods of cell development.The periods that are actually sensitive to epigenetic control are those that are the sames one that were sensitive when we talked about assertive reproductive technologies or IVF. The sensitive period was the slow growth period of about eight to ten years in the grandmother's or around the time they were born.<br />3)the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms, the pre implanted and early post implantation period. These two periods of germ cell development and early embryonic development.<br />4)As we know,a consequence for cancer, perhaps just one cell needs to be affected, most cells may be able to very well maintain. Even one cell is adversely affected and you then have downstream consequences and additional hits like the Knudsen hypothesis,which can result in a tumor.Though, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisabl<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-03dcd9e612ed282e6a569294/970238/asst-5/970238-5212daabd16157.67034035.txt">Q4.txt</a></p></div>
