    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells. CpG island are hypomethylated, by contrast, in cancer cells are hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation in tumor supressor genes allowscycle cell dysregulation and tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In the other side , there is a genome wide hypermethylation in normal cells including intergenic regions,repetitive element and intragenic regions. Cancercells are hypomethylated in this gions leading gennomic inestability with recombination abnormalities with chromosome translocation, deletions,etc.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG island shores can be also found in some tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If  imprinted gene are involucred in cell growth or contains supressor tumor genes, alteration in DNA methylation may alters cycle cell. In H19/IgF2 cluster ( chromosoma 11) ICR is methylated and it don't bind CTCF allowing Enhacers-IgF2 gene interaction(expresse in paternal allele)</p>
<p>Maternal allele is imprinted,because ICR is unmethylated and it bindsCTCF and enhancers allo H19 espression.When maternal ICR is methylated both IgF2 alleles asre expressed) (double dosis of growth cell signal)..Wilmas tumor</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNMT inhibitors, and drecreased DNA methylation " ide novo" (taht occurs in the new strans of DNA in cell in replicatión).</p>
<p>The mecanism is unclear , maybe in Decitabine clears the markts of Cpg islan in supressor tumor gen promotors</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics changes passes to the daugtherscells , so the effects are longer than the drug exposure.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are during primordial germ cells development and the first stages of human development.</p>
<p>During sensitive period most epigenetics markts are erased so , the exposition to drugs that change this process could have effects in another generation</p></div>
