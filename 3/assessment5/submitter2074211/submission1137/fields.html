    <div class="field-value"><p>- Epigenetics is defined as the study of the modifications of DNA and histones that are inheritable and not<br />altering the sequence of DNA bases. between histone modifications that are hurt are: methylation, phosphorylation<br />and acetylation. however, the molecule of DNA methylation occurs only. this consists of adding a cluster<br />the methyl cytosine that usually precedes a guanine (CpG dinucleotide) and is present mainly in<br />promoter regions of genes. DNA methylation participates in gene transcription, among other functions.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is one of the first imprinted genes discovered and occupies a centre stage in the<br />study of imprinting. This is because it has dramatic effects on the control of fetal growth, it is<br />involved in growth disorders and in cancer, it interacts with products of other imprinted genes,<br />and its imprinting status is under complex regulation in a cluster of tightly linked imprinted genes.<br />Here we review briefly the key features of Igf2 imprinting in normal development and in disease,<br />and hope to show what a fascinating subject of study this gene and its biology provides.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>GlaxoSmithKline, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, described the meeting in its efforts to develop a substance that inhibits the activity of an enzyme called EZH2. This enzyme confers methyl groups to histone proteins, which form part of the packaging chromosome. A lot of lymphomas of immune-system cancers are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. This hyperactivity methylates histone longer than they should be and thus surrounding silence genes, including genes called tumor suppressor whose function is to prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that cause cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The methylation markers are also being studied in fecal DNA to determine its usefulness for early detection of colon cancer and / or risk of this disease and similarly for the purpose of lung cancer using sputum DNA. The laboratory of Dr. Baylin plays a special role in these collaborative studies, helping to contribute genetic markers and help in some translational studies.</p>
<p>Secondly, the use of reverse gene silencing as a strategy for cancer prevention and / or therapy is another major implication of translation of the work. The work is fundamental to chromatin concepts that will be incorporated in these strategies. The translational implications are contributing to the ongoing work in the laboratory to clinical use Herman direct these concepts. This laboratory work supports the efforts of Drs. Steve Gore and Mike Carducci to conduct clinical trials of agents and inhibitors of histone deacetylase demethylating in all forms of cancer.<br /><br /></p></div>
