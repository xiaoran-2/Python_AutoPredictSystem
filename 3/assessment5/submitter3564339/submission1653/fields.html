    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> CpG islands preceding gene promoters are normally protected from DNA methylation, hence are unmethylated in normal cells. In cancer cells CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters tend to become hypermethylated, and the underlying gene is silenced. Hypermethylation in CpG islands causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprented genes and silencing the tumor suppressor genes, controlling cell cycle, DNA repair.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions maintain genomic integrity and silence cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. In repetitive elements DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity, silence the repeats to prevent transposition, mutate the repeats to prevent transposition, silence the repeats so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, it can also prevent illegitamate recombination.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes chromosomal - genomic instability, translocations, gene disruptions and reactivation of endoparasitic sequences.</p>
<p>For instance :Loss of imprinting of different genes increases risk of specific cancers.</p>
<p>Disruptions of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements changes the genomic instability, when there are abnormal karyotypes like deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 gene which encodes fetal growth factor is expressed in the paternal allele and is paternally imprinted.H19 is repressed and methylated.</p>
<p>Maternal allele of Igf2 gene is repressed, H19 in maternal allele is maternally expressed and unmethylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour imprinting is distrupted by silencing/inactivation of H19 by methylation and biallelic expression of Igf2. Too much Igf2 (oncogene) which is growth promoting can lead to excess growth and tumour.</p>
<p>Without CTCF, an insulator protein, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it and upregulation leads to growth and a possible tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><br /><br /><br />Decitabine, an anticancer- cytotoxic -chemotherapy drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.  </p>
<p>Decitabine, classified as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent. Epigenetic therapy attempts to change the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to DNA, it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It has bipartite anti-tumour effect : blocks DNMTs and causes demethylation of DNA, this happens when 5-AZA-CdR converts into its triphosphate form by phosphorylation and binds covalently to the DNA. In the process of demethylation, tumor suppressor genes restore their normal function as well the control over cell growth. As an antimetabolite, when the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is one way how cells control gene expression. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Switching genes on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and acetyl groups.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are time or stage when a person is more vulnerable for certain stimuli and changes and when some important development occurs, like in the first 3 months of pregnancy, years after birth and in youngsters.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are embryonic- germ cells, neonatal and adolescence.</p>
<p>Treating a patient during these sensitive periods can lead to to an epigenetic inheritance and/or different errors in DNA methylation which can lead to cancer. Germline -dependent epigenetic change occurs when the epigenetic imprint is mediated through the germline and it passed through to subsequent generations.</p></div>
