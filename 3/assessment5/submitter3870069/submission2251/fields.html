    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are present in 5' regulatory elements of genes and are therefore responsible regulation of downstream gene. Normally CpG islands are not methylated which allows them to be accessible to transcription machinery. Methylation of CpG islands affects there normal functioning.CpG islands are often found in promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes. In cancer these CpG islands are hypermethylated and this hypermethylation keeps on increasing as cancer progresses. Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, these epimutations are transferred to the daughter cells. These cells with epimutations have a cell- division and growth advantage which leads to formation of tumour and ultimately cancer. Though in different type of cancers different CpG islands can get hypermethylated and cause cancer. </p>
<p>DNA of intergeneric regions and repetitive elements is always methylated in healthy cells. This methylations prevents expression of genes which are harmful for normal functioning of cells. It maintains genomic stability. During cancer these intergeneric regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated which leads to expression of genes coded by them. Expression of such genes interfere with normal functioning of cells. Repetitive elements make copies of themeselves and gets inserted in between other genes which disrupt their function and lead to disruption of gene. Repetitive elements can also activate some genes because of their cryptic promoter activity. And if the newly activated gene is an oncogene then it can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated and CTCF cannot bind to it. Thus the enhancers can act on Igf2 gene and it is expressed.</p>
<p>In case of maternal allele the imprint control region is not methylated and CTCF can bind to insulate it. Thus enhancers act on H19 gene and H19 is expressed.In case of Wilm's tumour both the maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated and Igf2 is expressed from both the alleles. Thus there is double expression of Igf2 protein. Igf2 is a growth promoting protein and is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drug which are DNA methyl transferase inhibitors.Decitabine is a nucleoside and it gets incorporated into DNA during DNA replication step of cell division. For copying the epigenetic methylation marks DNA methyl transferase act upon this newly synthesized DNA (which has Decitabine incorporated into it) and binds irreversibly. As a result this DNA methyl transferase is not available for its activity on other methylation sites.The mode of action of Decitabine is cell division dependent, therefore it acts more severely on rapidly dividing tumour cells than normal cells and shows anti-tumour effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Control on altering the content of methylation of epigenome by either making it hypermethylated or hypomethylated can be used as potential therapeutic. Since in many cancers the methylation content of cell genome changes drastically it can be of great impotance.But care should be taken for the sensitive period specially during younger stages i.e gestation when epigenetic programming is happening.Such treatments should be done with utmost care because these epigenetic changes will be continued throughout the life of individual and will have significant effect on future generations.</p>
