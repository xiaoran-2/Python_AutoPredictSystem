    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is necessary for life but this characteristic of the DNA has to be in certain regions. We can find some regions like CpG island that are normally methylated like in promoters of some genes principally the oncogenes because methylation is associated with gene silencing in those regions. In the process of oncogenesis due to a variety of some factors, the methylation status differs between normal and cancerigenic cell and the CpG island tends to be hypermethylated on the promoters of tumor supressor genes and hypomethylated on oncogenes which causes a descontrolled growth. Other regions that are involved in tumorigenesis are intergenic and repetitive elements that normally are methylated because that prevents genomic instability and recombination with other regions with similar siquences, some enzymes and expression of many RNAs may be altered in cancer so they can lead the methylation in many regions like intergenic and repetitive elements casing genomic instability (insertions, duplications, deletions, transpositions, etc.) and accelerate the growth of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the H19/Igf2 cluster there is a imprinted control region (ICR) that are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele, upstream of ICR is found the Igf2 gene and downstream the H19 gene is located, the function of unmethylated ICR is bind the protein CTCF which in turns recruits some cofactors (p68/SRA) that prevents the action of enhancers over the Igf2 and are redirected to the H19 gene, that occurs on maternal allele, on the other hand, in the paternal allele whose ICR is methylated, the CTCF protein can not bind to this site, and the enhancers can access to the Igf2 altogether with methylation at the H19 promoter and some other differentially methylated regions located upstream. The Igf2 gene is associated with cell growth, so, when due to altered expression of some regulators of methylation, the ICR is methylated at maternal allele and there are increased expression of Igf2 that prmotes cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an analog of cytidine, it is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase because of its incorporation to the DNA and its capacity to bind covalently with the protein (DNA methyltransferase) and perform cytotoxicity because the replication can not be carried out and the decrease of the activity of DNA demethylase. On cancer tumor supressor genes are hypermethylated, because the action of decitabine it can be reverted, and those genes increase their action and decrease cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the cell growth there are different fases, one of them are the sensitive periods where the epigenetic marks are erased an re-established (origin of primordial germ cells and embryo), on those periods of growth, the cell are more susceptible to the chemotherapy in combination with drugs that inhibit methylation, because there are some mechanism that are altered in the cell that origins hypermethylation. There are methyltransferases that copy the methylation pattern and tends to make permanent the DNA changes, but during those periods other marks are re-established like the repetitive elements and intergenic regions tha will prevent genomic instability, imprinted genes also, and other marks that is why is the treatment during those periods is inadvisable, the drug must be specifically to the tumor cells for being advisable.</p></div>
