    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands silences or inactivates specific genes across different cell types, rendering them different from each other.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation is usually a characteristic finding in cancer cells, occuring at CpG islands and Cpg island shores.It is mainly present near tumour supressor genes, rendering them silent, facilitating oncogenesis or tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation at ICRs is also found to produce loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, dna methylation preserves the genomic integrity, as its loss displays different types of mutations: deletions, translocation and insertion.</p>
<p>At repetitive elements the main function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic integrity, as many of them contain transposons, thus preventing their transpositioning, and it`s known that methylation of cytosine is mutagenic, so permanently disables the transposon.Silencing of repeats also prevents inappropriate recombination and transcriptional interference.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine prevents oncogenes from being transcribed</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Asensitive period is a period of clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks which is very sensitive to environmental factors to a degree that epigenomic alterations Occurring in this period persists for life until subsequent resetting occurs e. g.: Germ cell Development &amp; early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Thus Treating A-patient with epigenomic modifiers in this period will either affect his offsprings or if it is administrated during embryogenesis it could affect him for life.</p></div>
