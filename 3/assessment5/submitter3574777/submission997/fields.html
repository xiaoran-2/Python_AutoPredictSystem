    <h1>Submission 997 from Anon (session_user_id: f5be60f3cebe0921ba34d91d242d33a6267429fa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic state is mitotically heritable and thus, changes in DNA methylation will be retained throughout an organism’s lifetime. In addition, epigenetic marks can be passed down through generations.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sensitive periods of development are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, which occur during early embryonic development and in primordial germ cell development. Alterations or removal of normal processes during sensitive periods can result in epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because treatment could lead to unintended and serious changes to their epigenome.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression. CpG islands are usually protected from methylation, but in cancer cells they are hypermethylated - both in single genes and in sets of genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands silences tumor suppressor genes. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, a cancerous cell's daughter cells will retain the methylation. As such, the cells’ tumour suppressor genes will also be silenced, allowing for the spread of cancer in the tissue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells. Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps maintain genomic stability. A lack of genomic stability can lead to duplication, insertions, deletions, reciprocal translocations, and illegitimate recombination. Historically, the first epigenetic abnormality found in cancer was a genome-wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. A depletion of DNA methylation is context dependent. If a tumour is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then a lack of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis. If a tumour is driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11 and is enhancer blocking. Igf2 is imprinted, with expression favored from the paternal allele. The protein CTCF is involved in repressing expression of the gene in the maternal allele, by insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation of ICRs leads to loss of imprinting. A loss of imprinting causes the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, so both Igf2 and H19 are transcribed from both parental alleles. Upregulation of Igf2 causes an activation of oncogenes and promotion of growth (through a loss of expression of growth-restricting genes and overexpression of growth-promoting genes). </span>Cancer is, in essence, an activation of oncogenes (as well as inactivation of tumour suppressors), so disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer. Promotion of growth helps cancer spread.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi). DNMTis are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, and thus hypomethylate DNA. An increase of DNA methylation, such as that seen in CpG islands, can result in blockage of tumour suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division is unregulated, promoting the spread of cancer. Therefore, decitabine interferes with the methylation of DNA, giving normal function to tumour suppressor genes. In addition, decitabine is an antimetabolite, which causes death of abnormal cells and promotes normal specialization and blood cell growth. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</span></span></p></div>
