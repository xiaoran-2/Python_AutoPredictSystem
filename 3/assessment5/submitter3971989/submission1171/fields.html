    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The function of DNA methylation in the body is to maintain genomic stability, by influencing which genes are expressed and those that are not.</span></p>
<p><span>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to control gene expression.  CpG islands are normally not methylated.  This allows for the transcription of genes from CpG promoter regions.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer cells, there is typically a change in state of the methylation patterns of CpG islands from hypomethylated towards hypermethylated.  Additionally, other somatic cells change from hypermethylation towards hypomethylation.</span></p>
<p><span>Disruption to the DNA methylation state of CpG islands in cancer cells contributes to disease.  This is because the DNA methylation state at CpG islands has a similar effect as a genetic mutation that silences tumour suppressor genes i.e. the methylation can result in the loss of function of downstream genes which prevent the cell from functioning as normal.  An accumulation of "hits" as described by the Knudson hypothesis can result in tumourigenesis.</span></p>
<p><span>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated, silenced and bound in heterochromatin.  DNA methylation in the body can be mutagenic (C to T transitions likely).  For the body to favour methylation at specific areas like repetitive elements, it must have a function.  This function is to protect the genome from potentially mutagenic transposable elements by silencing the repeats to prevent transposition.  Similarly, silencing at intergenic regions serves the function of blocking other transcriptional start sites that are confusing to the cellular purpose i.e cryptic splice sites.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions become  hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability.</span> </p>
<p>This disruption of the normal methylation state of intergenic regions causes disease because the DNA becomes open and is able to align with other repeat regions and recombine or cause deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruptions to the normal imprinted state of a gene can contribute to cancer by increasing or decreasing the expression of growth promoting genes.  The H19 / IgF2 ICR cluster shows an example of this.</span></p>
<p><span>The H19 / IgF2 paternal allele is normally methylated.  CTCF (an insulator protein) is unable to bind to methylated ICR’s.  Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter through heterochromatin spreading, becoming silenced.  This allows for enhancers to follow their preferred pathway and act on IgF2 and express this gene;</span></p>
<p><span>Conversely, the H19 / IgF2 ICR of the maternal allele is normally unmethylated.  CTCF is now able to bind to the ICR.   This effectively insulates IgF2 from downstream enhancers.  The enhancers instead act on H19, enhancing this genes expression, and IgF2 is no longer enhanced and therefore cannot be expressed. </span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm’s tumour, imprinting of the H19 / IgF2 cluster is disrupted by hypermethylation of the ICR which leads to IgF2 overexpression.  The maternal allele becomes methylated and behaves like the paternal allele.  </span></p>
<p><span>This disruption contributes to disease by generating a double dose of the growth promoting IgF2, which has the deleterious effect of causing the childhood kidney tumour known as Wilm’s tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an FDA approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  </span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML (acute myelod leukaemia).   </span></p>
<p><span>The impact of using such a drug on the epigenome is that it results in a drop in DNA methylation within the body. A recent study involving 100 patients with Decitabine resulted in complete remittance and disappearance of the disease in almost half the patients (Nova epigenetic therapy, 2007).</span></p>
<p>It works by limiting the incorporation of methyl groups into daughter DNA that is undergoing replication (such as rapidly growing cancer cells).    Decitabine’s anti-tumour effect occurs when the cell is able to “lose” the abberant hypermethylation pattern which is causing the diseased cancer state.  The drug "brings back" the expression of previously silenced genes so that they can return to their normal function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs have the ability to change or disrupt the methylation marks on the epigenome.  Anything that alters the DNA methylation pattern in the body is something to be cautious of as these changes are mitotically heritable and generally cannot be changed.  The exception is during sensitive periods which can be defined as periods where it is normal for the epigenetic makeup to be cleared, reset and reprogrammed.</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods are generally during gametogenesis when eggs and sperm are made in an adult and also at fertilisation, when the egg and sperm meet.</span></p>
<p>The treating of a patient during a sensitive period is inadvisable because we do not know the effects that this would cause, particularly on a pregnant woman.  It is likely the rapidly dividing fetus cells would undergo deleterious, permanent and irreversible methylation changes to their dividing cells.  </p>
<p>For example, Decitabine is a DNMTi epigenetic drug that decreases the overall methylation state of the body.  It would be in advisable to use a drug that decreases methylation patterns in the body when a cell is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming that resets the methylation patterns.  </p>
