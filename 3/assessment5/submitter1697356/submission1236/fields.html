    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a normal epigenetic mechanism involved in many phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin, and represents the modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base, found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells.</p>
<p>CpGs are clustered into CpG islands, which are found in about 60% at promoters of the genes. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression by formation of a repressive chromatin structure or by prohibiting transcription factor binding, which alter the gene expression. CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state whether intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.</p>
<p>Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation occurs in CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes, and in ICR. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene, including tumor-suppressors genes. Genome wide DNA methylation studies revealed that hypermethylated CpG islands vary by tumor type - RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer, etc. They can also be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and informed treatment. Recently discovered hypermethylation in CpG island shores correlates well with gene expression in cancers, as well as in normal tissue differentiation.</p>
<p>Hypo- or hypermethylation in ICR leads to loss of imprinting. It is a common, early event, often seen in preneoplastic tissue. It can results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpressing in growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements maintains genome integrity by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promotors, and may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>Historically the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome-wide lack of methylation. Hypomethylation at intergenetic regions and repetitive elements leads to genetic instability. Consequence of hypomethylations depends on location – where it is on CpG poor promotors leads to oncogene activation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2- (insulin-like growth factor 2) and H19-genes are imprinted in mammals; they are expressed unevenly from the two parental alleles. Both the Igf2-gene and the H19-gene are imprinted in a reciprocal matter in most somatic cells, where the paternal chromosome express IGF2 but not H19, and the maternal transcribe H19 but not IGF2.</p>
<p>The imprinting control region (ICR) at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. CTCF is a transcriptional repressor and an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p>
<p>Overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), an imprinted gene located on chromosome 11p15, has been reported as a characteristic feature in various embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor (WT). However, the role of other imprinted genes in the genesis of WT is still unknown. Alterations of the differential methylated region of H19 were found in two-thirds of the WTs. Alterations of the DNA modification machinery drive erroneous setting of methylation marks in imprinting regions throughout the genome, which leads to the concomitant activation of imprinted genes in blastomagenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

<p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is an epigenetic inhibitor drug, classified as DNA-demethylating agent. These agents, as known as DNMTs inhibitors, are nucleoside analogues, which bind irreversibly to DNM transferases. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Chemically, it is a cytidine analog, who can only be incorporated  into DNA strands, not in RNA chains. The mechanism of action of Decitabine is still unclear but it is thought that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase after incorporate in DNA strand.</p>
<p>The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is related to tumor-suppressor gene. Haematological malignancies are characterized by Hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor gene, so Decitabine demethylated them and convert gene silencing of  in gene expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications, unlike other forms of gene regulation, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Since DNA-demetilating agents are used for cancer treatment, many studies investigate the prolong effects of the drugs. Nucleoside analogues, by direct incorporation into centromeric DNA sequences, could lead to heterochromatin decondensation and altered centromeric structure.</p>
<p>At low doses DNA demethylating agents can induce the reexpression of aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes, allowing tumor cells to revert to a normal phenotype (terminal differentiation) and/or reacquire cellular pathways crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction. Based on their ability to induce the reexpression of tumor suppressor genes, DNA demethylating drugs can be used as “biosensitizers” by increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to standard oncologic therapeutics or procedures.</p>
<p>Demetilating agents should be avoid in sensitive periods (such as stage of gametogenesis, fertilized eggs, blastocyst, epiblast, primordial germ cells, gametes). DNA demetilating drugs and their alterations in mechanism of DNA methylation have irreversible effect on human genome and may lead to developing cancer. Or the future children of the patients may impair their development because epigenetic marks/drug modifications need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. <br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-856d11a987909929ac39b4f8/970238/asst-5/970238-5210e9dc97fcc5.35335771.txt">Q4-.txt</a></p>
