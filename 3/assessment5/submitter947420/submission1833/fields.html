    <h1>Submission 1833 from Anon (session_user_id: c5e7d8fed319322cfe5bd7fce94a19e0e4b41bb4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal DNA Methylation at CpG islands is a way for otherwise dangerous genes to be suppressed by transcriptional silencing. If the CpG islands are unmethylated, then the genes are transcribed.</p>
<p>Sometimes CpG islands lie in front of genes that produce proteins involved in regulating cell death or tumor suppressing. During cases however when those CpG islands become hypermethylated, the cell death and tumor suppressing genes become silenced. This promotes cancerous cell activity.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation can lead to unusual genes being activated e.g. potentially cancerous promoters, illegitimate repeats, unusual recombination.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is supposed to silence genes.</p>
<p>However at those same intergenic regions, when there are instances of hypomethylation, there can result illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoterse and distruption to neighboring genes.</p>
<p>Disruptions in the intergenic regions due to hypomethylation can lead to chromosomal instability and therefore tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In IGF2 cluster, the paternal allele is unmethylated and therefore expressed. The maternal IGF2 allele is methylated and not expressed.  Though when the ICR is hypermethylated, Igf2 will be overexpressed, which leads to Wilm’s tumour. Additionally, when IGF2 alleles in both mother and father are expressed, this can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent and, therefore, demethylates DNA. Because it de-methylates DNA, it can have an effect on areas of the epigenome that are hypermethylated. Additionally, tumor suppressing genes that are suppressed because of methylation can be demehtlyated as a result of this drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can have enduring effects on the epigenome evidenced by the idea that they can be passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells. The sensitive period (particularly embryogenesis, gametogenesis) is the period where epigenetic marks are being established. </p>
<p>Treating patients with these drugs may cause irreversible changes to the methylation state when it might otherwise be unnecessary during the sensitive period.</p></div>
