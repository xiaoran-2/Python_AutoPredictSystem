    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the basis for many epigenetic phenomena, ie imprinting, X inactivation, and the formation of heterochromatin. Usually, CpG islands are protected from methylation. When they are methylated, because they are often located in promotors, the associated genes are silenced. In cancer, DNA hypermethylation is often found in the promotors of tumor supressor genes. Thus, the tumor supressor genes are no longer functional. Additionally, hypermethylation of imprinting control regions can lead to a loss of imprinting marks and altered gene expression (sometimes increases, sometimes not), a common early event in cancer development. </p>
<p>While, in cancer, methylation increases in the CpG islands, it is reduced in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. . The normal function of methylation in these areas is to stabilize the genome -- to reduce translocations, and the "jumping," insertion, and repeating of repetive elements. It may also inhibit antisense transcription.  Hypomethylation leads to depackaging and thus greater activity in these regions, and because this activity is often mutagenic, it can lead to cells with a cancer phenotype. It can also lead to activation of oncogenes. There are CpG poor promotors that, normally methylated, become active when hypomethylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Any alteration to DNA methylation will be mitotically heritable, for good or for ill. So, while the changes that have given rise to the cancer are conserved, any subsequent changes that cause the cancer to be non-cancerous or less malignant are also "remembered." I would avoid giving these drugs in sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are stripped away from the genes and later re-established. It is believed that these changes are necessary to restore cells to a state or pluripotency that is necessary in embryonic development and in gametogenesis. Thus, it would be unwise to give these drugs to women who might become pregnant (because their eggs undergo some final maturing at that point), in early pregnancy to spare the embryo, and to males in the time right before adolescence when the gametes are maturing, because the drugs could interfere with either the removal or the re-establishment of epigenetic marks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The removal of imprinting marks is believed to be a common early occurrence in cancer, often giving a not yet cancerous cell a more developmentally early, or neoplastic, phenotype.  Imprinted genes are most often involved in growth (either enhancing or suppressing).  The removal of imprinting marks can lead to either silencing (both maternal and paternal genes silent) or increased expression (both activated).  The H19/Igf2 cluster of genes is hypermethylated in some cancers. In normal cells, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is insulated by CTCF, which allows downstream enhances to act on the H19 gene and blocks expression of the Igf2 gene. The methylated ICR on the paternal allele is not insulated by CTCF and also leads to methylation in the H19 gene, blocking it's expression and leaving the enhancers free to act on Igf2. In Wilm's tumor the maternal ICR is also methylated, which leads to doubling of Igf2 expression (growth promoting) and complete silencing of H19.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a dna methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It acts on the DNMT class of enzymes in the epigenetic machinery. DNMTs increase methylation in normal cells, contributing to genomic stability, and they are essential to cell survival (DNMT knockout mice are non-viable). Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue which must be incorporated into the DNA. Once there, it binds to a DNMT and makes it non-functional. Because it must be incorporated into the DNA, it requires cell division. Once the DNMT is captured, DNA methylation is reduced, and the cell dies. While is could obviously have very unwanted effects in normal cells, the drug "targets" cancer tumors because cancer cells are rapidly dividing (though it is also incorporated into normal cells that are dividing as well).</p></div>
