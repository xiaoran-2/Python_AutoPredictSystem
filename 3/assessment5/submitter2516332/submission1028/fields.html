    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation occur on C5 position of CpG in normal cells mostly in intergenic or repetitive element region. Associated with gene silencing if found in promoter. Inactive epigenetic mark. CpG on promoters usually not methylated to remain its activity. Mitotically heritable, maintian during cell division. Give genomic stability, integrity. Basis in formation heterochromatin or X inactivation. Silencing marks essential for life (embryogenezis,development). Lay down DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b. Can remove actively with TET or passively. But mutagenic, can change meC to T.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG in promoters are hypermethylated (mostly on tumor or metastasis suppressor genes), silencing mark on affected cells pass trough on daughter and next generations cells while  repetitve and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer often occur in CIMP or CpG island shores ( in shores associated with gene expression maybe oncogenes). Reversible action, epigenetic drugs can effect to treat them with less side effects. In cancer genome wide hypomethylation and regionic hypermethylation can be observed. Disrupt the genomic stability and integrity, change chromatin structure-open where shuldnt be, not prohibit transcription factors-where should be, occur transcriptional interference, illegitimal recombination.</p>
<p>Normally intergeninic region and repetitive elements are methylated, maintain genomic stability, integrity, silence cryptic transcription start sites ans splice sites, avoid transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. During epigenetic reprogramming repetitive elements high methylation level are maintained.</p>
<p>In cancer cell both are hypomethylated resulting genomic instability activating growth promoting genes and all  defense function turnn other direction. Repetitive elements then copy themselves, jump into genes disrupting them, mutagenic effect: deletion, insertion, duplication,translocation, but also strong promoters of their LTR regions activate genes.The surrounding regions disrupt because of genomic or transcriptional disruption. In intergenic regions small not powefull promoter is hypomethylated might express genes on other direction cause transcriptional interference.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting occur when few genes in mammalian genome have monoallelic parent of origin gene  expression. Epigenetic process involve DNA methylation/ histone modification achieving monoallelic gene expression, and no modify the genome sequence. One parental allel is silenced while the other works only in these genes. Controlled by ICR. Plays role in growth and development.</p>
<p>On paternal allel of H19 (lncRNA) gene and ICR are methylated so cant express H19-nc and cant bind to ICR an insulator CTCF protein so lgf2 (oncogene) is accessible for enhancers so express lgf2. Paternal methylation at DMR1,DMR2(located on lgf2 promoter) occur after fertilization.</p>
<p>On maternal allel the ICR is unmethylated so can bind the CTCF insulator so enhancers free to act on H19-nc to express, lgf2 is not express. The lgf2 locus on maternal allel: no lgf2 expression because no Airn expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour hypermethylation of ICR cause overexpression of lgf2 because of paternal and maternal allele are also methylated on ICR.</p>
<p>Abnormal regularity of ICR because of its hypermethylation change the normal expression state, H19 (normally restrain growth) no express and lgf2 overexpress to promote growth lead to cancer. Lgf2 overexpression associated many types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, FDA approved epigenetic anti-cancer drug. For treat myeloidpalstic syndrome progress to AML. Nucleosid analogue(cytidine), irreversibly bind DMNT after incorporate into DNA. Hypometilaging agent by inhibit DNA methyltransferase. Replication, cell division dependent. Have effect on rapidly divinding cancer cells. Cancer cells are diving more rapidly than normal cells so have effect on these. Use DNMTi after replication no remethylation on new DNA strand, so appear totally unmethylated allele so tumorsuppressor genes being acitvated again.  The drug has pleiotrop effect on cancer cells with less side effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation cause change in epigenome which then pass trough on daughter and next cell generations. Once epigenetic marks remove do not return, works only on targetted cells and stop growing cancer cells. Have less side effect of epigenetic drugs and do not kill cells, opposite general chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>
<p>2 sensitive epigenetic reprogramming periods are when removing (actively/passively) epigenetic marks and resetting them during in early development and/or PGC development. Treatment during sensitive periods may cause disruption in epigenetic reprogramming: a pregnant lady with a progeny in early development may disrupt DNA methylation on ICR, so can misexpress the maternal protect protein for ICR. In younger patient in PGC development (gametogenesis) can cause non predictable changes in patient’s germ cells and maybe in their future offsprings.</p></div>
