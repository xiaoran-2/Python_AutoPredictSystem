    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process, in which the 5` group of cytosines whithin CpG dinucleotides is methylated. DNA methylation occurs by methyltransferases like DNMT3a, DNMT3b and maintained by DNMT1.This process occurs at intergenic invervals and modificates DNA molecule without any changes in nucleotide sequence. DNA methylation - is an inactive epigenetic mark, that is associated with gene silencing and differs between different cell types. DNA methylation is mitotiically heritable due to features of DNMT1 and can be removed passively, or actively.</p>
<p>DNA methylation has many functions:</p>
<ul><li>protection from transposable elements.</li>
<li>silencing of repeats</li>
<li>avoiding transcriptional interference</li>
<li>prevents illegitimate recombination</li>
</ul><p>DNA methylation is mutagenic, but it has a vital benefit - protection the genome from transposones.</p>
<p>So, DNA methylation plays an important role in gene transcription and, therefore, in etiology of many diseases, like cancer. Important to note, that any deviations in patterns of methylation - hypomethylation or hypermethylation can lead to desease.</p>
<p>Case of hypermethylation:</p>
<ul><li>In normal cell of CpG island is hypomethylated, intergenic regions are methylated, repetetive elements are also methylated. In normal case it helps to prevent genomic instability. In case of cancer, intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. So, whole genome is hypomethylated, and CpG island are hypermethylated. </li>
<li>CpG islands are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So, in cancer tumour supressors are hypermethylated, which leads to fast cell division and tissue hyperplasia. </li>
</ul><p>Case of hypomethylation:</p>
<ul><li>Hypomethylation occurs at repeats.</li>
<li>In normal cell recombinations wouldn`t happen because of heavily methylated and heterochromatonized repeats. </li>
<li>In case of cancer there is a high promethylation of repetative elements or the intergenic regions. </li>
<li>Repeats can make copies of themselves, transpose. </li>
<li>It leads to genomic instability.</li>
</ul><p>So, in case of cancer there is a hypomethylation genome-wide in one hand, and hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor gene in other.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a antineoplastic drug and hypomethylating agent. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. When the cells incorporate antimetabolite into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells (apoptosis)</p>
<p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It incorporates into DNA upon replication and when DNA methyltransferase come to bind it, the DNMT1 comes to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released.</p>
<p>So, the action of Decitabine is division dependent. It means, that rapidly dividing cancer cells will be more affected.</p>
<p>Decitabine seems to cause DNA methylation in some cases. But mechanism of action is still not clear. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Insulin-like growth factor 2 (lgf2) gene promotes the growth and division of cells in many different tissues.</p>
<p>Igf2 copy is inherited from father. Mothers copy is methylated. This is a phenomen of genomic imprinting.</p>
<p><span class="geneSymbol">Igf2</span> is part of a cluster of genes on the short arm of chromosome 11, that undergo genomic imprinting. Another gene in this cluster, <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span>, is also involved in growth and development.</p>
<p>In normal case, the <span class="geneSymbol">Igf2</span> gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active.  In some cancers both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce. This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting</p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to diseases like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene activity and increased activity of the <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene in many tissues. A loss of <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene activity, which normally restrains growth, and an increase in <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene activity, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors. </p>
<div dir="ltr">So, loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While epigenetics play a role in development in embryogenesis, plays a role in maintaining our tissues, it is difficult to modify once we are adults.</p>
<p>For a cancer cell, these epigenetic changes are absolutely essential for the cancer cell to continue behaving as a cancer. Therefore, any modification of these epigenetic changes might mean a large effect on the behavior of a cancer cell, but only a small effect on the behavior of a normal cell. Reassuringly, when we stop these drugs the epigenetic patterns of normal cells go back to essentially normal.</p></div>
