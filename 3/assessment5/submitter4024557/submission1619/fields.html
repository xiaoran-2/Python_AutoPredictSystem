    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands inhibits the gene expression (CpG islands are unmetylated on active genes). In cancer cells, these CpG islands are methylated, so the genes which are close to these islands are inactivated. If these inactivated genes are tumour supressor genes, it's easier to appear cancer. Some examples are the inactivation of RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT genes.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is the opposite that in CpG islands (to activate genes), so these regions are normally hypermethylated. But in cancer cells these regions are hypomethilated, activating the oncogenes, which are the genes responsables of cancer. This can occur, for example, by a mutation in DNMT3B (ICF syndrome). The hypomethylation of these regions also cause genomic instability: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. All that can end with cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer in many ways, and one of these ways is changing the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>Normally, the paternal allele has the imprint control region methylated, so CTCF (an insulator element) can't bind to this region, so the enhancers act on Igf2. So Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the imprint control region is normally unmethylated, so CTCF bind to it and the enhancers activate H19, but not Igf2 on the maternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is like the paternal allele, so the imprint control region is methylated and Igf2 is expressed in both alleles. That means that there will be the double amount of Igf2 in the cells, and that causes cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA-demethylsting drugs. This drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. What Decitabine does is to demethylate the DNA, so in the cases which a cancer is produced by hypermethylation on the DNA this drug can improve that.</p>
<p>Like it occurs with the use of all the epigenetic drugs, the epigenetic changes that are produced are hereted during cell division, so finally there aren't anormal cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are passed on during cell division, so when you "repair" the epigenomics of a cell, when this cell divides on two cells, these two cell will be normal (epigenetically repaired). These two cells will divide in four cells, 8 cells, 16 cells... so the amount of normal cells will grow exponentially.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during an organism's life which is susceptible to epigenetic changes, so environmental factors can change the epigenetics control on the cells during these periods and that have consequences for itself and for it's offspring. The sensitive periods of development are the period of primordial germ cell development, the preimplantation and early post implantation periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because that can have a lot of bad effects on the epigenome.that would have consequences for his all life and his sons' life.</p></div>
