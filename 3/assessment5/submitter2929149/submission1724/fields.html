    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions (IR) and repetitive elements (RE): Only a small percentage of methylation occurs at CpG islands (activation and gene silencing). Predominant fraction of methylation marks occurs at IR or RE. At IR this methylation marks the beginnings and ends of the genes, helps with differentiating the introns and exons while transcription - insurance transcription mechanism. At RE methylation ussually silences repetitive elements, that are able to eighther to replicate and transpose into other gene regions or are cable of homological recombination, which  disrupts genome stability.</p>
<p>EVERY CANCER IS CHERECTERISTIC THE HYPERMETHYLATION OF TUMOR SUPRESSORS AND GENOME WIDE HYPOMETHYLATION.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in cancer occurs at CpG islands and disrupts the silencing of the methylated genes and the consequence of hypomethylation is dependend on the specific gene that was silenced and its function. It happens early in the disease and progresses with time as the mutation and genome instabilities become more pronounced. The genes that tend to get hypomethylated in cancer are oncogenes which strongly contribute to the disease progression as they promote cell division and activate cell cycle (silenced in differentiated cells). On the other hand the hypermethylation affects tumorsupressor genes which act oppsite to oncogenes and are the guardians of the genome stability and inhibit cell cycle. Their hypermethylation causes silencing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IR and RE are responsible for genome instability in cancer. Their hypomethylation causes recombinations, which cause genome instabilities - deletions, translocations and insertions  of chromosomes. Transponsomes become active, can replicate and incorporate into the genes (cause disruption of gene function) affect gene surrouding - change gene transcription (activate or cancel it).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This gene cluster is paternally imprinted - the imprint controll region (ICR) is methylated and the alle is silenced. At maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, binds CTCF (insulator protein) and transcription enhancers are bound to the promoter region of H19 gene which is trascribed (Igf2 is silenced). At the paternall allele this bond is not permited due to the methylation - H19 is not transcribed (enhacers bind to the Igf2 promoter - Igf2 is transcribed). </p>
<p>The disruption of the methylation occurs at ICR. In cancer eighter hyper or hypomethylation of imprinted regions can occur. It is solely dependent on the effected gene. In this particular case hypermethylation is the crucial epigenetic change. Hypermethylation of the maternal allele causes the silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2 from both parental alleles - loss of imprinting results in the double dose of Igf2 protein. Igf2 is a growth promoting protein associated whith Wilms tumor - special kind of childhood kidney tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer threatment drug that belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents and is used for myelodysplastic syndrome treatment (the beginning of acute myelogenous leukaemia). It binds to demethylases and inhibits the maintnance of the genome methylation, which helps to reactivate genes previously silenced as a result of cancer progression. Reactivation of genes silenced ("by cancer") - tumor supressor genes -  inhibits cell division and maybe can also restore genome stability and therefore inhibit cancer progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic change that is heritable - is the same in daughter cells. Shortly after the chromosome replication the methylation pattern of the maternal DNA is established on the newly synthesised DNA thread by DNA-methylases. Alterations in this pattern are therefore heritable and these drugs could have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprograming. A stage indevelopement whenmethylation pattern (not each and every methylation on the genome but a large part of it) is reset. Sensitive periods: the preimplantation early development of an embryo, primordial germ cell development. During these periods the level of methylation drops for a while until the methylation is restablished and this mechanism ensures totipotency of the zygote and the establishment of parental imprinting.</p>
<p>Experimenting with methylation levels in this periods could effect the development of the embryo and cause irreversible epigenetic changes. Shortly after fertalisation there is a period of demethylation of paternal and maternal genome which is a key period in embryo development. If demethylases are affected by epigenic cancer treatment (demethylation ihibitors) this process could be interupted and the embryo would be most likely terminated. Similar process happens in primordial germ cell development. </p></div>
