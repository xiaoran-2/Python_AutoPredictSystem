    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are, on average, unmethylated at GpG islands which allows for the transcription of the genes near the islands. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be over methylated which inhibits the ability of trancription of genes near the islands. If you have tumor suppressor genes that are active, as they are in normal cells, then uncontrolled cell division does not occur. But, if the CpG island becomes hypermethylated, the ability to express tumor suppressor genes is inhibitied leading to uncontrolled cell growth and cell division...a hallmark of cancer. Intergentic regions and repetitive elements are, on average, more methylated in normal cells which represses these sequences and stabilizes the genome. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become less methylated to decrease genomic stability and allow for transposition of genes, deletion, insertions, etc. In cancer genes, a physical changes occurs in the chromosomes as pieces are inserted, deleted or are broken. This can alter the expression of particular genes as they my have been turned off while part of one chromosome, but at another may be turned on because they are now located next to an expressed and active promoter leading to more, or less, product produced due to overexpression or hypoexpression in the altered cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal paternal allele, the imprint control region is silenced through hypermethylation which prevents CTCF from binding. This causes hypermethylation of the H19 gene and turns H19 expression off. This allows for the enhancers to increase Igf2 expression. In the normal maternal allele, the imprint control region is hypomethylated which allows CTCF to bind. This causes H19 to be hypomethylated and, therefore expressed. H19 expression causes the enhancers to increase CTCF expression and increase binding of CTCF to the imprint control region which continues the loop without allowing for Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal imprint control region is abnormally hypermethylated and silenced leading to hypermethylantion and silencing of H19. The enhancers are then free to enhance the expression of the maternal Igf2 gene. Essentially, the maternal allele has been converted, in action, to the paternal allele causing the production of double the amount of Igf2 needed by the cell. Igf2 codes for  growth promoting activities by the cell. When the paternal allele produces just the right amount of product and then you have increased production by the maternal allele through epigenetic abnormality, the cell is abberantly stimulated to increase growth and division leading to tumor production and the formation of cancerous tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Decitabane is a nucleotide analog that is inserted into the DNA through cell division. When DNMT1 comes along to "copy" methylation marks from the parental chromosome to the daughter chromosome, the nucleotide analog irreversibly binds DNMT1 preventing methylation of the daughter chromosomes. In persons with myelodysplastic syndrome, it can lead to the loss of methylation of the newly formed cells over time which may have the ability to reestablish proper marks at CpG islands of tumor supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. While intiailly, the new daughter strand of DNA is unmethylated, within a few hours, a whole host of enzymes come in and copy the epigenetic marks of the parental strands to the daughter cells. Then the cell divides to produce two daughter cells that are clones of the original cell. A sensitive period is a time when certain epigenetic marks are cleared and reset in an organism. The first sensitive period is between fertilization of the egg and the formation of the blastocyst. The second sensitive period occurs when the primordial germ cells are being formed. Decitabine is a good example of the dangers of treating patients during sensitive periods. Without DNMT1 during primordial development, development stops in utero around mid-gestation and that life ceases to be.</p></div>
