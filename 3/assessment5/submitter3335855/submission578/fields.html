    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. However, the latest research shows that hydroxylation of methyl groups occurs rather than complete removal of methyl groups in zygote. Some methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and cause genomic imprinting. Also, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA that have been incorporated into the genome of the host over time. DNA methylation also forms the basis of chromatin structure, which enables a single cell to grow into multiple organs or perform multiple functions. DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development of nearly all types of cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine has the specific effect of reducing gene expression and has been found in every vertebrate examined. In adult somatic cells <strong>DNA methylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide</strong> context, non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embryonic stem cells, and has also been indicated in neural development.</p>
<p>And, <strong>in cancer</strong>, It is an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that genes with high levels of 5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent, and that DNA methylation gradually accumulates upon long-term gene silencing. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. <strong>Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation.</strong> Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>For IGF2 (Genomic) Imprinting</strong>, methylation at the IGF2/H19 imprinting control region (ICR) has been linked with cerebellum weight. We aimed to investigate whether decreased IGF2/H19 ICR methylation is associated with decreased birth and childhood anthropometry and increased contemporaneous adiposity. The H19-IGF2 locus within the imprinted cluster of the human chromosome 11, has been implicated in a variety of disorders and cancer pre-disposition including bladder cancer. BBN induced bladder cancer model in rats has identified both H19 and IGF2 among differentially expressed genes that are induced in response to carcinogen exposure.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>the role of both H19 and IGF2 genes in cancer will be handled in general with special focus on bladder cancer</strong>. Although IGF2 role in human cancers is relatively well established, recent data from our laboratory and others have just revealed a critical role for H19 RNA in the process of tumorigenicity including that of the bladder. H19 functions as a stress modulator, being induced by hypoxia, and a survival factor that is involved in several fundamental processes of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we uncovered a molecular mechanism that integrates H19, p53 and HIF1 to hypoxic stress response.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Example, New inhibitor named GSK2816126 of GSK,  <strong>treated lymphoma cells</strong> with this inhibitor and found that it reduced the growth of tumor cells. He also saw that it had no effect on any normal cells that were nearby. One picture in our lecture showed the cell division with normal p53 protein and then another picture showed the cell division with abnormal <strong>p53 protein</strong>. About the <strong>cell division process</strong>, all of the background information about cancer during continued on with the study of a different aspect of cancer, which focused on epigenetic processes. It also made me think of when we did the natural selection lab with the birdseed. The fact that epigenetic processes are open to drug treatment is very exciting in hopes that someday someone might find some sort of<strong> anti-tumour</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern in question is that many of the genes whose breakage leads to cancer are themselves involved in a specific sort of genetic regulation, known as epigenetics. This switches genes on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and acetyl groups. The nature of these reactions means epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention in a way that genetic mutations are not. They are, in other words, open to drug treatment.</p>
<p>who leads the epigenetics research group at GlaxoSmithKline, one of the world's biggest drug companies, described to the meeting his efforts to develop a substance that will inhibit the activity of an enzyme called EZH2. This enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas cancers of the immune system are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
