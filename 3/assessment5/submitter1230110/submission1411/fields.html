    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation is known to be an important epigenetic modification. DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. In normal cells CpG islands are unmethylated while the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated. In cancer cells, however, local hypermethylation of certain CpG islands occurs while the repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated  CpG island hypermethylation is associated with gene silencing; affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone. Aberrant de novo hypermethylation occurring in transformed cells serves as an alternative mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The methylated residues are thought to recruit methyl-binding proteins (e.g. MeCP2) and associated factors, such as histone deacetylases, leading to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional shut-down (reviewed by  Wade, 2001)). Thus, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of growth controlling genes (cell cycle regulators, DNA repair enzymes, and other potential tumor suppressor genes), can contribute importantly to cancer development and/or progression. In adult cells, human repetitive elements (REs) are generally highly methylated and this status is associated with maintenance of chromosome structure and genome integrity. In cancer cells, hypomethylation of REs and intergenic regions is observed. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons). In cancer cells, a genome-wide hypomethylation is observed, which could contribute to carcinogenesis through oncogene activation, retrotransposon activation and chromosome instability. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting (Su, et al., 2012; Hassler and Egger, 2012).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Two genes, insulin-like growth factor 2 (<em>Igf2</em>) and <em>H19</em>, are located in domain 1 of the 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster. <em>Igf2</em> is a paternally expressed fetal growth factor gene with an important role in cancer development. H19 is a maternally expressed noncoding RNA with possible tumor-suppressor functions. The reciprocal imprinting of <em>Igf2</em> and <em>H19</em> is controlled imprinting center 1 (IC1) in the majority of tissues. IC1 (also known as H19 DMR) is a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator located between IGF2 and H19. Its nonmethylated maternal allele interacts with the multi-zinc finger protein CTCF. This binding is required on the maternal chromosome for maintaining the nonmethylated status of the region and preventing the activation of the <em>Igf2 </em>promoter by downstream enhancers that activate the <em>H19</em> gene instead. On the paternal chromosome, conversely, DNA methylation prevents CTCF binding at IC1 and allows the enhancer-mediated activation of <em>Igf2</em> while the <em>H19</em> promoter is hypermethylated and silenced. In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting is loss and the maternal allele becomes methylated like the paternal allele, allowing the activation of downstream enhancers, thus, <em>Igf2 </em>is transcribed by both alleles resulting to <em>Igf2 </em>overexpression and consecutive tumor formation (Riccio, et al., 2009).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to a class of drug known as DNA demethylase inhibitor.  Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA and after incorporation, they may cause cell death by obstructing DNA synthesis or may induce structural instability and DNA damage or by binding to DNA methyl transferase. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells (chemocare.com).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Good cells and bad cells continue to divide and in the case of drugs that belongs to a class of DNMT inhibitors it's posssible that they could also demethylate the normal cells aside from the cancer cells. Unmethylated DNA is mitotically heritable so the patient can carry and reproduce these cells containing unmethylated DNA during its lifetime. This is why they are avoiding treating young patients who are in the stage of germ cell production stage (the sensitive period) with DNMTi class of drugs. Sensitive periods are during reprogramming of the genome when methylation occurs and when epigentic marks are being laid down to the maternal and paternal genome. This is during primordial germ cell development and early stages of development.</p></div>
