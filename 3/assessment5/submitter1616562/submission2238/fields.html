    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually the CpG islands which are found in about 60% of promoters are unmethylated. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in  transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Tumour suppressor genes are silenced in cancer because of the DNA methylation in CpG islands. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found unmethylated. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can keep these regions silence. DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The regions of Igf2 gene are more methylated on the expressed paternal chromosome and which causes <span class="st">imprinting of lgf2 (paternal allele expressed)</span>, but in contrast to the maternal allele, lgf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor lgf2 is overexpressed and  its imprinting is disrupted. A transcript that is antisense to IGF2, IGF2-antisense (IGF2-AS), is transcribed from within IGF2 in a reverse orientation. This transcript is also maternally imprinted and overexpressed in Wilms' tumor. In Wilms' tumors that demonstrate maintenance of imprinting of IGF2, IGF2-AS was imprinted. Loss of IGF2 imprinting will cause disease, including cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a histone-deacetylase inhibitor. Decitabine can decrease or inhibit the  DNA methylation. It works as a substance known as JQ1, which inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocks the activity of a gene by the name of Myc. Myc encodes a protein called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation system. This particular transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes, it blocks Myc and stops the cancer, finally reduces the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue. DNA methylation is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. Some methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and cause genomic imprinting. A sensitive period is a period  in early life that the environment gets factored into development. This period is usually in childhood. In this period, the epigenetic modifications' effects are stable, and persist into adulthood, if there are some "bad" input, it will last the whole life, so it would be inadvisable.</p></div>
