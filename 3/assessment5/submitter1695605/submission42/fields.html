    <h1>Submission 42 from Anon (session_user_id: 21faac7da07b9eff5f004388b57f770ea5f1f1a0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, ie removing the methyl group attached to DNA. Hypermethylation of DNA often silences gene expression. If that silenced gene is a tumour suppressor gene, tumour formation may occur in a higher rate. Administering Decitabine can specifically remove some of the methyl group on DNA so the tumour suppressor gene will be on and effectively suppress tumour formation or growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is metastable, ie the pattern can pass on to the daughter cells and more generations, before they are actively removed during reprogramming. Therefore, once the drug alters the DNA methylation pattern in a cell, that of the (grand-)daughter cells will be inherited and behave as the (grand-)parent cells. In Baylin's case, better response to chemotherapy with previous intake of the epigentic drug.</p>
<p>Epigenetically sensitive period is the time when epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed, ie removed and re-tagged. There are 2 sensitive periods in a life-time, namely the pre-implantation stage of an embryo and during the primodial germ cell formation in later stage. Any external influence may make the reprogramming faulty and unfavourible results may be seen. If an epigenetic drug is administered during these sensitive periods, over- or under-methylation may be resulted, causing silencing and activating the gene in an unwanted way. Regarding the cancer pathology, the undesired situation will be silencing of the tumour suppressor genes and the activation of the (proto-)oncogenes, which will cause higher cancer rate. Therefore, application of epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually hypomethylated in normal cells and tumour suppressor genes express. In cancer cells, these originally hypomethylated CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated. As a result the tumour suppressor genes are not expressed and the tumours are not suppressed. Usually a specific set or a panel of CpG islands are hypermethylated in a particular cancer which makes itself a more accurate biomarker set for diagnosis or prognosis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally in the hypermethylation state, ie suppressing those genes they regulate. Some of those may be oncogenes. In cancer cells, these regions loss the hypermethylation state and the genes regulated, like oncogenes, have expression in an abnormally high level. Also, genome-wide hypomethylation can cause the genomic instability. If the active region makes extra copies of itself and transpose to other chromosome, the normal function of other genes may be disrupted. Deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocation of chromosome may also be resulted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal case, the paternal imprint control region (ICR) is methylated so that CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. As a result, the downstream enhancer can enhance the expression of Igf2. The CTCF binding makes the H19 gene promoter methylated, resulting in down-regulation of H19. ICR is not methylated in the maternal allele, which allows the CTCF binding onto ICR. H19 gene is expressed without the methylated promoter. The binging of CTCF onto the ICR blocks the downstream  enhancer to enhance the expression of Igf2; thus Igf2 in down-regulated in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, ICR of both the paternal and the maternal alleles are hypermethylated. As a result, both of the copies of Igf2 are expressed. Since Igf2 exprssion is related to growth of cell, over-expression of Igf2 will lead to over growth of cells and tumour will form.</p></div>
