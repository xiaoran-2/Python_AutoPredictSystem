<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>1. CpG islands (CGIs) are short interspersed DNA sequences that deviate significantly from the average genomic pattern by being GC-rich, CpG-rich, and <strong>predominantly nonmethylated</strong>. CGIs are sites of transcription initiation. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.</li>
<li>2. CpG island methylation is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands become hypermethylated.</li>
<li>3. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. In <a title="Cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a>, gene promoter <a title="CpG island" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island">CpG islands</a> acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in <a title="Transcriptional silencing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_silencing">transcriptional silencing</a> of tumour suppressor genes that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less <a title="Methylcytosine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcytosine">methylcytosine</a> than the genome of a healthy cell.</li>
<li>4/5. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell but <strong>nmethylated </strong>in a cancer cell.</li>
<li>6. Hypomethylation of these parts of the genome leads to <a title="Chromosome instability (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chromosome_instability&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">chromosome instability</a> due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of <a title="Transposable element" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element">transposable elements</a>..</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is a <a title="Genetics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics">genetic</a> phenomenon by which certain <a title="Gene" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene">genes</a> can be <a title="Gene expression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression">expressed</a> in a <a title="Parent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent">parent</a>-of-origin-specific manner - from the non-imprinted allele.</span></p>
<ul><li><span>1. Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Paternal allele: ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on paternal allele. CTCF is not binding and there is no insulator action. Enhancers are free to access Ifg2 and promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele.</span></p>
<ul><li><span>2. Maternal allele: ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. It is bound by protein CTCF - insulator protein. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Enhancers act on H19 instead and enhance it's expression on maternal allele, breaking the preferred loop between enhancers and Igf2 - secondary preference. </span></li>
</ul><p><span>H19 - LncRNA - is produced just from the maternal allele.</span></p>
<ul><li><span>3. Willm's tumour (childhood kidney cancer) is caused by loss of imprinting which makes maternal allele behave like paternal. It results in  loss of Cdkn1 - tumour suppressor and an overdose of Ifgf2- growth promoter.</span></li>
<li><span>4. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. Loss of imprinting is a common feature for cancers. Disrupted imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster results in expression of growth and suppression of tumour promoter genes.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Current drugs targeting epigenetic machinery are enzymatic epigenetic regulators since enzymes are most readily targeted with small molecular inhibitors.&lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--&gt;</span></p>
<ul><li><span>1. Decitabine belongs to DNMTi class of epigenetic inhibitors - DNA methyltransferese inhibitors. Used to treat Myelodisplastic syndrome progressed to AML.</span></li>
<li><span>2. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. It Irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependant. Causes DNA methylation. Most effective in Myelodisplastic syndrome  possibly due to dependency on CpG islands hypermethylation which is a sign of poor prognosis for MDS.</span></li>
<li><span>2/3. DNA methyltransferese inhibitors are incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNA DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy to a daughter strand that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. The action of DNMT is division dependant - you have to have cells replicating. This means that cancer cells that divide more rapidly will be severely affected. </span></li>
</ul><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span class="pullquote-text">The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to  "reprogram" the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer  cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="pullquote-text">In other words the idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from killing the cell. Rather to change the instructions of the cancer cells so they start behaving normally again by bringing back the expression of the genes that have been silenced in the cancer cell and letting those genes do the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="pullquote-text">The drugs also appear to alter gene activity in stem  cell-like cancer cells—cells that are capable of self-renewal and that studies  have suggested are inherently resistant to most current therapies.</span></p>
<ul><li><span class="pullquote-text">1. Main concern in regards to epigenetic drugs is lack of specificity to their mechanism of action - long term efefct on the whole epigenome is unknown.</span><span class="pullquote-text"></span></li>
<li><span class="pullquote-text">2. Sensitive period is a period of establishment of epigenetic marks (reprogramming) rather than maintenance. </span></li>
<li><span class="pullquote-text"> 3. Periods for epigenetic programming of the germ line are those associated with primordial germ cell development and subsequent fetal germline development.</span></li>
<li><span class="pullquote-text">4. Epigenetics marks can be transmitted transgenerationaly, so any alterations to epigenome during sensitive periods may have multi-generational effect.</span></li>
