    <div class="field-value"><p>Many CpGs are clustered into ‘islands’, genomic regions that contain lots of <a title="CpG site" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_site">CpG sites</a>. Since CpG islands are often found in or near gene promoters, if there is methylation, it is often associated with gene silencing. In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. However, there are exceptions. For example, inactive X chromosomes have extensive CpG island methylation.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG islands protected from methylation in normal cells are more likely to be methylated. Hypermethylation tends to be found in islands associated with promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Silencing through methylation is mitotically heritable. Thus the hypermethylation results in replicative immortality. The epimutations are rapidly selected. Cells with dysfunctional suppressor genes have a competitive advantage over cells with expressible suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In addition to hypermethylation of CpG islands, cancer cells display other epigenetic abnormalities. In normal cells, CpG methylation tends to occur in introns, intergenic regions, and in repetitive elements. This methylation, particularly the methylation of repetitive elements, contributes to genomic stability. It mitigates against deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, and chromosome duplication. Methylation at repetitive elements silences the transposition of repeats. It silences strong cryptic promoters that have the potential to express, or interfere in the expression of, neighboring genes. In cancer cells, there tends to be little CpG methylation in introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. This hypomethylation leads to increased genomic instability with an increased chance of cancer inducing events. It leads to transcriptional aberrations, which might include activation of tumor-promoting genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cells is loss of imprinting. Either through ICR hypomethylation or hypermethylation, instead of one allele being expressed, both or neither are expressed. Dysfunction of imprinting is associated with cancer because lots of imprinted genes are involved with growth promotion or suppression.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor results from hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Status of ICR methylation determines the action of downstream enhancers. The enhancers prefer to promote the expression of Igf2, located upstream of the ICRs. Their second choice is H19 promotion, located between the ICRs and the enhancers.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated. The unmethylated maternal ICR is free to bind CTCF, which limits enhancer access to the Igf2 region. The maternal enhancers instead direct their attention to H19. The methylated paternal ICR cannot bind CTCF. With no binding and consequent insulation of Igf2, the paternal enhancers are free to promote Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>With Wilm’s tumor, both paternal and maternal ICR’s are methylated. Thus the ICR of neither allele can bind CTCF, and all enhancers are free to promote the expression of Igf2, leading to a double dose of a growth promoting protein.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is directed by DNA methyltransferases (e.g., DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B). Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1. DNMT1 recognizes hemi-methylated DNA resulting from DNA duplication and lays down methylation on the daughter strand to restore a fully methylated dinucleotide. When DNMT1 levels are reduced, as is the case following decitabine treatment, daughter strands are less likely to undergo such maintenance to restore full methylation. With each replication, the promoter regions are more accessible to transcription factors. A DNA methyltransferase inhibitor like Decitabine reverses methylation induced gene silencing of tumor suppressors. Reversal of these epigenetic mutations can restore control of cell growth and death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance can occur in humans in response to food supply and smoking. It seems not a great leap to add to this list drugs that specifically target the epigenome. The child of a pregnant woman is developing the F2 generation.  A drug that influences the epigenome of the mother may well influence that of the baby and the baby’s primordial germ cells. The primordial epigenome may in fact be the most vulnerable since germ cells are in a ‘sensitive period’.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are windows in which epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. They are periods in which the environment has the biggest influence on epigenetic makeup. They occur in early development and during primordial germ cell development. The Overkalix  study suggests the sensitivity of the latter window includes the start of puberty. It found that the food supply of grandparents (9-12 in boys, 8-10 in girls) affected their grandchild’s longevity.  </p>
<p>When the costs of using drugs that affect the epigenome are considered, consideration should include possible effects on future generations. There may well be hidden costs when treating a pregnant woman or a child; the drugs might affect the epigenome of their descendants.</p></div>
