    <div class="field-value"><p>     Many promoters (about 60%) contain CpG islands, which are regions rich in CpG dinucleotides and which are normally unmethylated, regardless of promoter activity.  Hypermethylation of a promoter's CpG islands causes silencing of gene expression from that promoter.  In many cancers, targeted hypermethylation at CpG islands of specific genes is found.  The genes whose promoters are hypermethylated in cancer cells, and thus whose expression is silenced, are tumor suppressor genes.  Silencing of tumor suppressor gene expression contributes to cancer, because these gene products are needed to regulate cell division and prevent runaway cell proliferation and metastasis.  A proposed mechanism of how targeted hypermethylation occurs in cancer is that methylation at a CpG island could occur randomly by chance, and such methylation at a tumor suppressor gene would be selected for, since those cells would have a growth advantage over cells which express the tumor suppressor gene.  The mitotic heritability of DNA methylation marks allows such selection to occur.</p>
<p>    The DNA of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally methylated.  This methylation is necessary for silencing transposons and for packaging this DNA into heterochromatin.  One function of this methylation and packaging of intergenic and repetitive DNA is to prevent illegitimate recombination between repeats from different parts of the genome during DNA repair, which would result in chromosomal abnormalities.  Intergenic and repetitive DNA is hypomethylated in all cancers.  Loss of methylation occurs early in tumorigenesis and progesses with time.  In consequence, tumors  accumulate chromosomal deletions, translocations and other rearrangements.  A deletion or breakpoint could result in loss of a tumor suppressor gene; a rearrangement could place a strong promoter next to a proto-oncogene.  These types of changes, as well as others, could propel a cell further down the path to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer.  Most imprinted genes encode proteins that promote growth and cell division.  They are expressed from only one of the two homologous chromosomes.  Any disruption of imprinting which causes both chromosomes to express the gene would result in overexpression of the growth factor and tend to promote unregulated cell division, a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is such an imprinted gene which is normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome.  The imprinting control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is normally methylated.  This methylation prevents binding of an insulator protein (CTCF) at the ICR, and, together with methylation of the H19 promoter, allows enhancers binding near the H19 gene to drive high expression of the Igf2 gene.  In contrast, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind and establish an insulator domain which blocks access of the H19 enhancers to Igf2.  In patients with Wilm's tumor the ICR of both maternal and paternal alleles is methylated, resulting in Igf2 expression from both chromosomes.  Increased Igf2 expression would then contribute to cancer because the higher amount of Igf2 growth factor would stimulate cells to proliferate. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Several drugs which affect epigenetics are being used to treat cancers.  Decitabine is one such drug.  It is an inhibitor of  DNA methyl transferase enzymes (DNMTs).  Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that can be incorporated into DNA in place of cytosine.  When the DNMT attempts to methylate the analog, the transition state during which the enzyme is covalently bound to the Decitabine cannot be resolved, and the enzyme becomes stuck.  Such stuck enzymes are degraded, resulting in depletion of DNMTs in the cell.  Over time, therefore, fewer regions will be methylated and the loss of methylation is mitotically heritable.  The result is that DNA methylation is decreased by Decitabine.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect if a driving force for that tumor is hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor gene promotors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some epigenetic drugs can have a lasting effect on tumor cells because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  If a drug removes DNA methylation at a CpG island in a cell, for example, that CpG island should remain unmethylated in the progeny of that cell, thereby resetting the cells to an earlier state in the progression of the tumor.  The problem is that epigenetic drugs act globally.  A drug like Decitabine reduces DNA methylation overall, not just at CpG islands. Such drugs might be especially dangerous to use during sensitive periods of development.  Sensitive periods are times when the epigenome is being actively remodeled, and thus may be particularly sensitive to environmental influences.  The two major sensitive periods are early embryogenesis and gametogenesis.  Any drug that altered the epigenome during those times could cause long-term changes in gene expression patterns for the life of the organism.  <br /> </p></div>
