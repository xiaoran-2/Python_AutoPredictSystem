    <div class="field-value"><p>Q. 1</p>
<p>In the normal genome DNA is hypomethylated in CpG islands in the promoters of normally expressed genes but hypermethylated in the promoters of silenced genes. DNA methylation also functions in the imprinting of genes and X inactivation. In general, DNA methylation serves to regulate the expression of genes.</p>
<p>In cancer the overall DNA methylation is increased, especially in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  Methylation tends to be decreased in promoters of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands generally, is likely to activate oncogenes, can result in genomic instability and various abnormalities (diseases).</p>
<p>DNA methylation in normal intergenic and repetitive elements helps to maintain chromosomal stability and telomere length.</p>
<p>Cancer disrupts the pattern of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive regions by demethylation.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive regions leads to instability of chromosomes, resulting in various abnormalities such as transpositions, additions, and deletions.  Such abnormalities often result in cancer and other diseases. The effect is similar to the effects of genetic mutations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q.2</p>
<p>The <em>H19/igf2</em> gene cluster involves cell growth.</p>
<p>Both maternal and paternal alleles comprise enhancers,<em> H19 </em>gene, an imprint control region and igf2 growth promoting gene (i.e. an oncogene).</p>
<p>The normal paternal allele ICR is hypermethylated which spreads to the promoter of<em> H19</em>. This enables the paternal enhancers to act on<em> igf2</em> and allow it to be expressed.</p>
<p>The normal maternal allele ICR is not methylated allowing an insulator protein CTCF to bind to it. The CTCF blocks the action of the enhancers on<em> igf2</em> resulting in silencing of the maternal copy of<em> igf2</em>.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor the normal imprinting is removed and the maternal ICR becomes hypermethylated. The enhancers on both the maternal and paternal alleles can now act directly on the respective<em> igf2</em> alleles causing both to be expressed. When both paternal and maternal <em>igf2</em> alleles are active this results in overexpression which is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer and other diseases by causing over expression of oncogenes or under expression of tumor suppressor genes.  This loss of imprinting is common in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q.3</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>It causes hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>Tumor cells tend to be DNA hypermethylated which silences many genes needed for normal tissue functioning, growth, differentiation and apoptosis and tumor suppression.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect by causing DNA hypomethylation in tumor cells.  This may restore normal functioning of tumor suppressor genes and other genes critical for normal cell growth and apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q.4</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks, of which DNA methylation is one kind, are mitotically heritable and can persist throughout many cell generations.  Unless modified by some intervention they have enduring effects.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those in which the epigenome is reprogrammed.   An example is shortly after fertilization when the existing epigenetic marks are mostly cleared from the zygote and blastula and a new epigenome is established in the developing embryo.   Another example is during the formation of primordial germ cells in a developing embryo.</p>
<p>Drugs which affect the epigenome should ideally be quite specific in their action and should be administered only after the epigenome is well established.  If they are administered during sensitive periods they might interfere with desired epigenetic reprogramming and have undesirable nonspecific action.</p>
