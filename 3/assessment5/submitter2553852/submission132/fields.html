    <div class="field-value"><p>- Methylation of CpG islands leads to transcriptional silencing. About 70% of promoters of human genes have a high CpG content. Thus, methylation of CpG in the promoter of a gene inhibits gene expression. In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated.</p>
<p>- In Cancers, aberrant DNA methylation is found to occur in form of hypomethylation (genome-wide) and hypermethylation, typically of CpG islands in promoter regions. Thus, the CpG methylation profile is inverted in cancer cells. </p>
<p>- In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, resulting in transcriptional silencing of these genes and this, subsequently, leads to unchecked tumor growth. Alongside, the CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased, thus promoting mutagenesis and tumor growth.</p>
<p> - The normal function of DNA methylation at intergeenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. Approprite methylation at these intergenic regions, silences a cryptic promoter, preventing transciptional interference  or a  cryptic splice site, preventing inaccurate splicing. While appropriate methylation of repetetive elements prevents occurence of mutagenic transposition and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>-  In cancer cells, global hypomethylation due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases, results in hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The resulting genomic instability promotes mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, .</p>
<p>- Hypomethylation at intergenic regions leads to illegitimate deletions, insertions, recombinations, reciprocal translocations, even duplications of chromosomes or  loss of chromosomes. Loss of methylation at repetitive elements reactivates transposable elements, which alongwith LTR associated strong promoters,  results in transcriptional aberrations in neighbouring regions.</p>
<p>- Thus, hypermethylation of CpG islands decreases tumor suppression while global hypomethylation results in mutagenesis and tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes (DNA methylation imprint on paternal chromosome) on chromosome 11 (short arm) is a good example of chromatin looping. The preferred loop is between the enhancers and Igf2. When the insulator protein, CTCF, binds and blocks it, the enhancers loop to H19, enhancing its expression.</p>
<p>- The imprint control region, on the paternal allele, is methylated. Thus, CTCF cannot bind to it. Since, there is no insulation of Igf2, the enhancers act on Igf2 promoting its expression.</p>
<p>- On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated. CTCF binds to it, insulating Igf2. The enhancers act on H19, enhancing its expression.</p>
<p>- In Wilms tumor, there is hypermethylation at Imprint control regions. The maternal Imprint control regions are methylated. This results in loss of imprint. The maternal allele starts behaving like the paternal allele and there is a functional paternal uniparental disomy.</p>
<p>- There is resulting upregulation and overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting (oncogene). Thus, Igf2 overexpression causes abnormal proliferartion of tissues, resulting in predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA Methylatransferase) Inhibitor (FDA approved).</p>
<p>- Decitabine acts as a hypomethylatiing agent. It is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits DNA methylation by irreversibly binding DNA Methyltransferase. However it can bind DNMTs only after they are incorporated into DNA. Thus, its hypomethylating action is replication dependent.</p>
<p>- Hypermethylation of CpG islands on promoter of tumor suppressor genes leads to silencing of these genes. Thus, there is undeterred growth of tissues leading to malignancy. Such hypermethylation is associated with a number of human malignancies especially Hematoligical malignancies. But these epigenetic alterations are reversible. Because of its hypomethylating action, Decitabine actually targets the epigenetic processes regulating genes.</p>
<p>- Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, Decitabine is cytotoxic due to the incorporation of covalent DNMT-decitabine adducts into DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- DNAmethylation is addition of methyl group to cytosine/adenine nucleotides in DNA. It alters expression of genes in cells as they divide/differentiate. Unlike other gene regulating processes, epigenetic changes (eg. DNAmethylation) are passed during cell division to daughter cells. But once actively erased, they don't return. Therefore epigenetic therapies targeting DNAmethylation can lead to heritable changes in neoplastic cells, which not only stop cancer growth but, leave surviving cells with altered methylation patterns permanently modifying their gene expression.</p>
<p>- Sensitive period is when cells are most vulnerable to epigenetic alterations like specific developmental periods when there is rapid naturally occurring epigenetic change, which is essential for differentiate.</p>
<p>- There are essentially two periods when there is dramatic decline in global DNAmethylation and subsequent steady increase in methylation. One is during formation of progenitors gametes, the primordial germ cells, during in utero development (while gonads are formed allowing for sex specific imprints). The second is just after fertilisation in early zygote.</p>
<p>- If, drugs targeting epigenetic machinery are given during such sensitive periods, they can adversely alter epienetics of stem cells leading to led to cellcycle arrest, failed or premature differentiation, failure of tissue self-renewal, etc resulting in widespread permanent damage.</p></div>
