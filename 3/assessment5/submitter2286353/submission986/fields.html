    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions of DNA with high content<span> of CpG dinucleotides relative to the genome. <span>In vertebrates, 60 to 90% of all CpGs are methylated. <span>DNA methylation is important for different events such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. However, CpG islands are mostly non-metilated even if that gene is not active. </span></span></span>Promoters  have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be metilated. DNA metilation on intergenic regions helps mantaining genomic stability. Metilation of repetitive elements mainteins genomic integrity. Hypometilation of these regions leads to genomic instability, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations that are tipical in cancer. Normaly recombinations happen in normal cells between regions that have genetic identity, but in cancer cell, repeats are hypometilated and intergenic regions are not heavily packed so recombinatons can happen between regions where it is not suppose to happen. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> <span class="geneSymbol">Igf2</span> gene , located on chromosome 11p15, undergoes metilation and only the copy inherited from the father is active. In some cancers both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, which increases the amount of igf2 that has been produced. This is known as loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Transcription of this gene is regulated by two major mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. Histone modifications inhibit transcription by DNA condensation. DNA methylation occurs in CpG rich sites of the genome. Methylation of CpGs in differential methylated regions (DMR) serves as a regulatory mechanism of imprinted genes. Overexpression of the igf<span class="geneSymbol">2 gene, </span>which is part of the IGF2/H19-cluster, has been associated with various embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor. An increased amount of igf2 can stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine<span> </span><span> is a nucleoside analog  drug </span><span>for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It</span> has specific hypomethylating effect and it is inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase activity that mediates DNA methylation. </p>
<p>Since there are big number of genes that are silenced in tumors by methylation, (like <span>promoter hypermethylation that plays a major role in cancer through silencing of growth regulators such as tumor suppressor genes), by</span> inhibition of this process Decitabine works as cancer therapy drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>During cell division epigenetic changes are passed from mother cell to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased they do not return, so this could be the way for these drugs to have effects that last after drug treatment has finished.</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods would be preimplantation period (early development) and premordial germ cell development, because there is epigenetic reprogramming happening  in these two periods. Since there is a DNA demetilation and then afterwards again metilation in these two periods it would be bad idea to treat patients with drugs that have hypometylating effect.</span></p>
