    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands regulate transcription.  In normal cells the DNA at CpG islands is hypomethylated allowing the strand to be in euchromatin form and for genes to be expressed.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer the CpG islands can become hypermethylated which can make the DNA more tigthly packed and silence genes.  Hypermethylation at CpG islands and island shores at the promotor regeons of tumour suppressor genes can silence these genes and as such can be regarded as potentialy one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">of accumulated mutations as the hypermethylation is mitotically heritable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Methylation in intergentic regions and repetitive elements has a role in maintaining genetic stability. In normal cells intergentic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and mainly compacted into heterchromatin increasing the stability of those areas. In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetative elements can be hypomethylated reducing the density of the packing into a more unwound form and potentially reducing stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to disease as the DNA is vulnerable to disruption via genomic instability such as inserions, deletions, recombination, activation of cryptic promotors or disruption to neighbouring genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Within a normal cell at the H19/lgf2 cluster imprint control region the paternal allele is methylated at the H19 promoter preventing the binding of the CTCF regulator protein so H19 is also methylated and not expressed and the enhancers act positively on lgf2 causing it's expression. The maternal allele imprint control region is not methylated at the H19 promotor allowing the binding of the CTCF <span>regulator protein </span>so H19 is not methylated and so produced and lgf2 is not. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the imprint control region of the H19/lgf2 cluster in the maternal allele is hypermethylated resulting in there being an under expression of H19, a tumour suppresor and an over expression of lgf2 which is a growth promotor gene - this imbalance leads to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor which can act as a DNA-demethylating agent.</span></p>
<p><span>For methylation marks to be mitotically heritable they need to be maintained during DNA replication, </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methyltransferases are a class of enzymes which methylate <span>cytosine</span></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> particularly in hemimethylated CpG di-nucelotides during mitosis, an inhibitor would block this action. When the CpG nucleotides are un-methylated <span>on CpG islands within promoter regions</span> the genes can then then be expressed, when thos occurs to a tumour suppressor gene it can have an anti-tumour effect.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mititically heritable, DNA methyltransferases act during mitosis to transfer methyl marks to the daughter strands of DNA enabling the new cells to express in the same way as the parent cell.  Sensitive periods are times of epigenetic reprogamming recognised as happening during early embryo development and during primordial germ cell formation. If treatment that alters epigenetic markers is undertaken in these times the altered markers could cause long term health problems not only to the patient but also to their ofspring. </p></div>
