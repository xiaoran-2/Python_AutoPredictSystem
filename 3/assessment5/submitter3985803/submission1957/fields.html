    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal, healthy tissues or cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated; CpG islands in the promoters of genes are often kept free of methylation to insure the normal activity of the genes (hypomethylation insures that certain genes, such as tumor suppressors, remain active). In cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated, especially in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This excessive methylation at CpG islands can result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and therefore can enable tumor cell survival and growth.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in normal, healthy tissue; this allows for overall genomic stability. In cancer cells, these regions are usually hypomethylated. This can result in genomic instability in tumor cells. Hypomethylation in repeats can lead to illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes, activation of repetitive elements (leading to transposition), and activation of cryptic promoters (leading to the illegitimate transcription of regions of DNA). Insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations can result; this generates general genomic instability. This genomic instability can promote tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is common in cancers, as changes to the methylation pattern of these regions can result in the increased activity of oncogenes or the loss of activity of tumor suppressor genes - an excellent example of this phenomenon can be seen in Wilm's tumor. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated; this allows the enhancers to act upon the Igf2 gene, allowing its expression. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated, which allows the insulator element CTCF to bind; this allows the enhancers to act on H19 and NOT Igf2, and Igf2 will therefore be silent/not expressed from the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation occurs on the maternal imprint control region as well. This results in a double dose of Igf2 in cells with the aberrant hypermethylation of the maternal imprint control region. Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, and thus a double dose can contribute to the abnormal growth of cells in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (the DNMTi class of epigenetic inhibitors). Decitabine therefore reduces the amount of DNA methylation in tumor cells (or in successive generations of tumor cells) by inhibiting the DNA methytransferases that allow the DNA methylation pattern to be inherited by daughter cells during cell division. It does this by irreversibly binding DNMTs after it (the drug) is incorporated into the DNA of the dividing cell. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect in tumors that are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation; by removing this hypermethylation, it may allow tumor suppressor genes to become reactivated, thereby preventing further tumor growth. The drug removes/reduces the hypermethylation that its characteristic of the tumors that it's designed to treat. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark; therefore, changes in DNA methylation will be inherited by successive generations of cells and thus have an enduring effect on the epigenome. Sensitive periods are periods epigenetic reprogramming during which the methylation pattern of cells/tissues is susceptible to changes from the envirnonment, and therefore the epigenome is sensitive to the environment during these times. The two major periods of epigenetic reprogramming (sensitive periods) occur during production of primordial germ cells through the production of eggs and sperm, and during the pre-implantation and early post-implantation of the embryo. There are other brief, tissue-specific sensitive periods that occur in various organs as the organism develops. As drugs that target the epigenetic machinery act throughout the body (and not just in tumor tissues), treating patients during sensitive periods may result in permanent (mitotically heritable) changes to important DNA methylation patterns in various tissues. Taking therapeutic drugs that target epigenetic patterns during sensitive periods could negatively impact development or lead to further disease.</p>
