    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Normally there is hypo methylation at CpG Islands.  But, in cancer we find locus specific hyper methylation at CpG Islands.  The hyper DNA methylation can silence tumour suppressor genes and become additive with other DNA hits to the genome leading to cancer.</p>
<p>  Normal genome wide hyper methylation is found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  DNA methylation in these areas contributes to genomic stability.  In cancer, we find genome wide hypo methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  The hypo methylation contributes to disease by causing genomic instability via illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Altering methylation (hyper or hypo) of Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) leads to loss of expression of growth restricting genes (H19) and overexpression of growth promoting genes (Igf2).  Normally the paternal ICR allele is methylated leading to Igf2 expression.  But, the maternal ICR allele is unmethylated and binds with CTCF which prevents enhancers from expresing Igf2 and instead expresses H19.  In Wilm's tumour, the maternal ICR allele is methylated like the paternal and leads to two copies of Igf2 and silencing of H19.  Extra Igf2 would promote more growthand the silencing of H19 a growth restricting gene contributes to cancer formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator that works as a DNMT-Inhibitor.  Decitabine will prevent DNA methylation of the daughter cells during replication.  In an adult the cancer cells would be replicating at a higher rate then normal somatic cells.  Therefore, the drug would target the new daughter cells epigenetic machinery by preventing the aberrant methylation pattern from being copied from the original mother cell.  It would not be selective to the cancer cells so worries would be in place if used during sensitive periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   DNA methylation is a normally stable epigenomic mark that is mitotically heritable during replication of daughter cells.  So, once DNA methylation is established in a somatic cell it should remain throughout the life of that organism.  A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed.  The sensitive periods are during early embryonic development and during the development of primordial germ cells (gametogenesis).  This would be an inadvisable time to treat patients with epigenetic altering medications as important epigentic marks are estblished during this period and altering them could cause many unknown but likely life threatening epigenetic alterations that could lead into genetic mutations as well.  </p></div>
