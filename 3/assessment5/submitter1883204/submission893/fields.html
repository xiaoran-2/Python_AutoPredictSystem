    <div class="field-value"><div><span><span><span>CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes, they have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression, this is because methylated CpG island can prohibit transcription factor binding, therefore, only a small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated between cell types. This will allow the expression of restricted subset of genes within each cell type during differentiation and development. CpG Island methylation also plays a big role in X chromosome inactivation so that males and females have the same dose of genes on the X chromosome. Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. The function of DNA methylation is to maintain genetic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites in intergenic regions and preventing transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination in repetitive elements.</span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span><span>In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells. Methylating CpG islands which are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes will inactivate tumour suppressor genes. Hence, this will allow that particular cell to gain a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues. Over a period of time, the cells that have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly or not die as much. On the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements whose normally methylated are hypomethylated in cancer cells, this increases genomic instability due to increasing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, besides activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</span></span></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span><span><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It belongs to a class called DNA-demethylating agents specified in targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators in this case inhibiting DNA methyl transferase.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span><span>Increasing in DNA methylation can result in silencing suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine have anti-tumour effect by acting as nucleoside analogs, which means they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and interfere with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Also, since DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are division dependent then cancer cells (which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body) will be more severely affected.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

<p class="western"><span>Genomic imprinting refer to the expression from just one of the two parental alleles, which occurs in a parent of origin's specific manner and associated with DNA methylation at imprint control region ICR.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span>One example is H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes where only the paternal allele is methylated at ICR while unmethylated on the maternal allele. Therefore, when this ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele it will be bound by a protein called CTCF (which is an insulator protein) to insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. These enhancers become free to enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele. However, on the paternal allele, when this ICR is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind; hence enhancers will promote the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. As such, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western"><span>In Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is hypermethylated as well. This results in a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what we expect in a normal cell. Igf2 is a growth promoter which can stimulate growth in tissues, as such, when Igf2 production is doubled then tissue growth rate would double as well.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span><span><span><span>It is possible that an epigenetic drug could alter DNA methylation and have effects that last after the period of drug treatment? One explanation is that epigenetic drugs altered the epigenome in tumour cells, these changes are then passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</span></span></span><br /><br /><span><span>The epigenome may be most vulnerable to environmental insults during periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming, which may in theory be disrupted by exposures that interfere with any process that governs reprogramming. Periods of particular vulnerability may therefore include the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the pre-implanted and early post implantation. Childhood is also proposed as a period of vulnerability, especially in the germline of females, since oocytes remain in a haploid de-methylated state until puberty.</span></span></span></p>
