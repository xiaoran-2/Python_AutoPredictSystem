    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>In many cancers there is a general genome-wide decrease in methylation, and an increase in methylation at particular locations.</p>
<p>        CpG islands (CGIs) are normally hypo-methylated. When the CGI is located in the promoter area of a gene, its hypo-methylation leaves the promotor available to initiate transcription of the gene.</p>
<p>If the gene in question is a tumor-suppressor, methylation can silence the promoter: the tumor suppressor will not be made. If the matching allele's CpG island (on the other chromosome) is also silenced by methylation, and enough additional different “hits” (gene mutations, epigenetic disruptions) occur, unsuppressed overgrowth can occur, leading to cancer.</p>
<p>        DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally methylated, stabilizing the genome. Loss of methylation, especially at repetitive elements,  renders the chromosomes vulnerable to insertions, translocations, deletions. If these mishaps interrupt a key suppressor gene rendering it inactive, or activate an oncogene, and enough additional different “hits” (gene mutations, epigenetic disruptions) occur, unsuppressed overgrowth can occur leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>Parent-of-origin imprinting assures mono-allelic expression of some genes. When both alleles express the gene, some cancers as well as overgrowth of placenta and other organs can occur.</p>
<p>        In the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the paternal allele's Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, and methylation tends to “spread” to H19's promoter (a CpG island), silencing H19 expression. Methylated ICR can't bind CTCF insulator; therefore downstream enhancers instead enhance upstream Igf2 (by chromatin looping), activating it. Igf2, an oncogene, is thus expressed only from the normal paternal allele.</p>
<p>        The maternal allele's ICR, normally unmethylated, can bind CTCF insulator. The insulator prevents enhancers from accessing Igf2 upstream; the oncogene will <strong>not</strong> be expressed from the normal maternal allele.</p>
<p>        Wilm's kidney tumor is one symptom of Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, in which both H19/Igf2 clusters behave like the paternally imprinted cluster. Loss of correct imprinting of the maternal allele can result from mutation, deletion, or epigenetic disruption. (Or the syndrome can result from uniparental disomy: a patient did not receive the maternal chromosome but got two normal paternal chromosomes.)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>Decitabine, a Cytidine analog, is an inhibitor of DNA methyl transferases (DNMTi), decreasing DNA methylation.</p>
<p>        In many cancers, normally methylated loci (such as repetitive elements and inter/intra genic sites) become hypo-methylated, while the normally hypo-methylated CpG islands become hyper-methylated. An agent that blocks DNA methyl transferases can prevent or decrease hyper-methylation of GPIs.</p>
<p>        If tumor suppressor genes were silenced by the abnormal hyper-methylation of CpG islands in their promoter regions, inhibiting DNA methyl transferase would ensure that when the DNA replicates in preparation for cell division, the daughter strands' CpG islands will not become hyper-methylated. After a few rounds of cell division, that DNA region would be hypo-methylated in a majority of cells. Tumor suppressor genes would again be expressed normally, and myeloplastic syndrome could be prevented from advancing into acute myelogenous leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable: DNA methyl transferases that are specific for hemi-methylated DNA copy the methylation of the parent strand onto the Cytosines of facing CpGs. Thus any alterations of DNA methylation will be passed on to daughter cells in the cell lineage, perpetuating the change.       </p>
<p>        Sensitive periods are times when the epigenome is cleared and reprogrammed. Parent-specific imprinting of epigenetic marks onto the chromosomes of gametes occurs during formation of eggs and sperm. Altered imprints, including altered DNA methylation, go to the next generation. Hyper-methylated repetitive elements are not cleared in the generally genome-wide clearance of epigenetic marks during gamete formation, nor during primordial germ cell (PGC) formation in the developing embryo. Alteration of repetitive elements' DNA methylation in the previous generation would thus be passed on in the epigenome of the offspring.</p>
<p>        In humans, key sensitive periods are early pregnancy (especially when embryo's PGCs differentiate from the cell mass); spermatogenesis (males esp ages 9-12); and oogenesis (females ages 8-10).</p>
<p>During these times, it is risky to treat with drugs that target the epigenome because they may alter the epigenome that the patients would pass on to their offspring.</p></div>
