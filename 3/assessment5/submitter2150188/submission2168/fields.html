    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, one can find locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<ul><li>CpG dinucleotides frequently cluster as CpG islands in promoters of genes. Normally, promoter CpG islands are protected from DNA methylation. The normal function of CpG island methylation is silencing of genes.</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated; rarely CpG-poor promoters are hypomethylated.</li>
<li>CpG Hypermethylation frequently silences tumor suppressor genes and positively correlates with tumor malignancy (i.e. increased hypermethylation in malignant tumors). Less tumor suppressor gene expression means increased (uncontrolled) cell growth. Hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands in cancer is called CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) and can be associated with good oder bad prognosis. Rarely, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters affects oncogenes, whose increased expression can promote tumor cell growth.</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally DNA methylated and hence silenced to prevent activation of cryptic promoters or splice sites, and to prevent mutagenesis by suppression of (retro)transposition of repetitive elements. Hence, the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to provide genomic stability.</li>
<li>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypomethylated. In addition there exist long-range epigenetic alterations (large organized chromatine lysine altered regions, LOCKs) that are hypermethylated and silenced (LRES) or may be hypomethylated and active (LREA) and may include intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements.</li>
<li>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can cause activation of cryptic promoters or splice sites resulting in aberrant gene expression. <br />Hypomethylation of repetitive elements can cause genomic instability via deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, transposition of repetitive elements. It can also cause activation of long-terminal-repeat (LTR) promoters interfering with normal expression of nearby genes. Hypermethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements within LOCKs may accumulate muations due to insufficient DNA repair.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, monoallelic gene expression is generally lost by hyper- or hypomethylation of imprint control regions, resulting in overexpression or expression-loss of the imprinted genes.</p>
<ul><li>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation pattern of the paternal allele consists of DNA methylation of the imprint control region (ICR) and of methylation spreading to the H19 promoter with subsequent silencing of H19 expression. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of insulator protein CTCF and hence downstream enhancers can activate expression of the growth-promoting (oncogene) Igf2.</li>
<li>The methylation pattern of the maternal allele consists of an unmethylated ICR and H19 promoter. CTCF can bind to ICR and the downstream enhancers can promote expression from the H19 promoter but activation of Igf2 expression is blocked by the insulator protein (no Igf2 expression).</li>
<li>In Wilms tumor, hypermethylation of the ICR on both the paternal and maternal allele occurs.</li>
<li>ICR hypermethylation of ICR on both alleles prevents CTCF insulator binding and allows downstream enhancers to overexpress the growth-promoting oncogene Igf2 from both alleles with twice the regular dosage.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is FDA-approved for myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloic leukemia.</p>
<ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.</li>
<li>Decitabine (5-Aza-2’-Desoxycytidine) is incorporated into DNA during mitosis. Decitabine can covalently and irreversibly bind to hemi-methyltransferase DNMT1 and prevent DNA methylation on the newly synthesized DNA strand. This results in DNA hypomethylation with subsequent cell divisions. As tumor cells divide more rapidly, they will be more severely affected.</li>
<li>The anti-tumor effect of decitabine can result from i) prevention of CpG island hypermethylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in reactivation of these genes with improved control of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis; ii) reduction of hypermethylation of imprint control regions, resulting in higher probability of correct monoallelic expression of imprinted genes (see Igf2 overexpression); iii) potential prevention of heterochromatin formation in LOCKs associated with increased mutation rates and rearranged nuclear architecture.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome after cessation of epigenetic drug treatment due to i) mitotic heritability of DNA methylation changes; and ii) selection of the new cells with less methylated epigenome, e.g. due to intrinsic factors (better control of growth, differentiation, and apoptosis; evasion from the immune system) or extrinsic factors (continued selection by standard chemotherapy, allowing cells with slower cell division to survive).</li>
<li>Sensitive periods are periods when treatment with epigenetic drugs should be avoided: in particular periods of rapid cell division and differentiation (as DNMTi are dependent on cell divisions), and periods of epigenetic reprogramming such as the embryonic pre-implantation phase and germ cell development.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods of human development are i) in dependence on the lecture of environmental effects (considering all epigenetic drugs): the periconceptional period (maturation of gametes, embryonic pre-implantation phase), mid-gestation (primordial germ cell development), the first 3 months of embryonic development and perinatal phase (organogenesis), and mid-childhood (“slow-growth period” during ≈ 8-11 yrs. of age); and ii) (considering particularly DNMTi and rapid cell growth/differentiation): the first 3 months of embryonic development; the newborn, toddler and early childhood periods; and puberty.</li>
