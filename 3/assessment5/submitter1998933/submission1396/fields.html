    <h1>Submission 1396 from Anon (session_user_id: 8de408879f388282f406eccc2a931bf743d6615b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA. It can have an anti-tumor effect because many cancers benefit from hypermethylation and subsequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA demethylating agents like dicetabine will inhibit this silencing. Cancer cells will be preferentially affected by agents like decitabine because it's effect is replication dependent due to it's incorporation into DNA, and cancer cells are actively dividing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division. Once methylation is erased,it does not return, so changes will be lasting. Sensitive periods are those where altered environments may have an effect on epigenetic control and they include primordial germ cell development, pre and post implantation periods, and organ based sensitivity during tissue differentiation and organ development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods could affect non-cancerous cell types which could result in negative heritable epigenetic changes which may additionally have trans-generational effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at the promoters of genes and are typically unmethylated in normal cells. In cancer cells, these CpG islands often become methylated resulting in silencing of associated genes.CpG island methylation increases as tissue progresses to neoplasia and metastasis. Some examples are RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer. CpG island hypermethylation can also affect sets of genes in cancer, which is called CIMP (CpG Island methylator phenotype). The gene sets affected vary by cancer type. Silencing of tumor supressors is one way that this disruption results in cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal cells which is important in maintaining genomic integrity, and silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. In cancer cells, these regions can become hypomethylated which is historically one of the earliest epigenetic abnormalities found. The consequence depends on the location. Hypomethylation in repeat or intergenic regions results in genomic instability, activation of repeats and transposons, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes such as RAS in gastric cancer. The end result leading to disease can either be due to silencing of tumor suppressors or activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTCF is an insulator protein which when bound to the ICR in the H19/igf2 cluster insulates igf2 from downstream enhancers, theoretically by preventing chromosome looping. The result is enhancer activation of H19 and silencing of igf2. DNA methylation at the ICR (which is paternally imprinted) prevents binding of CTCF and the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter.This results in silencing of H19 and enhancer activation of igf2. The maternal allele does not normally show this methylation pattern. The end result is that in the paternal allele, H19 is silenced and igf2 is expressed while in the maternal allele H19 is expressed and igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele takes on the methylation pattern of the paternal allele, resulting in overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene and thus, the overexpression of this gene is important for development of the tumor.</p></div>
