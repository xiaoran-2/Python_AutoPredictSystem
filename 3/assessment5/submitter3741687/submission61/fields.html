    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer cells has two main categories of abnormality. Hypermethylation of CpG islands and Hypomethylation of the remainder of the genome has been observed. Both of these paterns increase over time and aging.  The effects of the hyper and hypomethylation are dependent upon where they occur in the genome.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is uncommon at CpG islands in normal cells and this allows normal expression of tumor suppressor genes.  In cancer cells CpG islands and shores are hypermethylated.  This abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands then inhibits expression of tumor suppressor genes and thus promotes tumorgenesis. The hypermethylation "locks up" or makes the tumor suppressor gene less accesible to transcription.  </p>
<p>Methylation of DNA in the intergenic regions in normal cells  suppresses expression of genes and suppression of intergenic cryptic promoters.  Methylation of repetive elements  in normal cells makes these regions  less accessible for transcription and also for transposition or "jumping" to other places in the genome where they don't belong.  In cancer cells there is loss of methylation (hypomethylation) of both intergenic regions and repetetive elements.  Hypomethylation "opens up" the DNA and makes it more accessible thus increasing expression of cryptic intergenic promoters of genes.  Expression of cryptic promoters in the intergenic regions causes an abnormal increase in expression of genes and contributes to tumorgenesis.   Hypomethylation of repetitive elements increases expression of repetive elements and can also interfere with normal transcription of genes and allow increased transposition of these elements in the genome.  The repetitive elements that are over expressed can have effects on genes they do not normally target.  </p>
<p>Both hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to genome instability and tumorgenesis as they are mitotically heritable.  More rapidly dividing or growing cells may have a selective advantage, contributing to cancer growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting contributes to tumorgenesis by altering the normal expression of genes.  In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster disruption of normal imprinting occurs when the maternal allele becomes methylated stochastically and mitotically heritable. (Other methods of imprint disruption: mutation/deletion and parental disomy.)</p>
<p> Normally, the paternal allele ICR (imprint control region) in this cluster is methylated allowing the enhancers  to act on the Igf2 gene resulting in gene expression.  This methylation also "spreads" to the adjacent H19 gene promoter and silences H19 on the paternal allele.  </p>
<p>The normal maternal allele ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated  and binds CTCF,  blocking the enhancers from acting on Igf2 , thus silencing the maternal allele expression of Igf2. The enhancers also act on the adjacent  H19 gene causing expression of maternal H19.</p>
<p>Normal scenario results in the correct amount of Igf2- expressed from only the paternal allele.  In the case of Wilms tumor this normal balance is disrupted by methylation of the maternal allele ICR.  Once methylated, the CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and enhancers can act on the maternal allele Igf2 resulting in a "double dose" of Igf2 expression causing Wilms tumor. Maternal H19 is silenced. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which is incorporated into the DNA. During cell replication, this nucleoside binds irreversibly to DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT) thus inhibiting it and interfering with replication.  Its effect is replication dependent and essentially acts on the epigenetic "machinery" of the enzyme.  This class of drugs is called DNTM inhibitors.  This drug has a greater effect on dividing cells and so on cancer cells.  This drug works at a low dose has the benefit of being well tolerated by elderly patients presumably because it has less effect on healthy normal cells. The exact mechanism of action is unclear and higher doses used in the past were toxic and non specific.  Long term effects of decitabine are unclear. It is effective in myelodysplastic disorder that has progressed to AML and may have use in other hematologic and solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has lasting effects on the epigenome as the methylation is mitotically heritable. If a drug interferes with DNA methylation, depending on the context of where that methylation is located in the genome, it may have a tumor suppressive effect or tumorgenic effect.  For example, if the drug removed abnormal methylation of a CpG island that is a tumor suppressor, this would promote tumor suppression.  On the other hand, if the drug removed methylation of an intergenic island or repetetive element that may result in promoting tumorgenesis. </p>
<p> Regardless of the effect, as they will be mitotically heritable it would be prudent to avoid using the drug during "sensitive" periods of gametogenesis and early embryonic development.  In later embryonic development various tissue types also have "sensitive" periods at varying times as they are epigentically programmed.  These drugs may interfere with imprinting and with epigenetic reprograming in these cells.  Also, use in children, pre conception and post conception mothers may also have an effect on gametogenesis just as the grandsons of adolescent male smokers, and grandsons or grandaughters in the OverKalix data had transgenerational epigenetic effects. </p></div>
