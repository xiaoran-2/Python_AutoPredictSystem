    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands are generally located at the promotor regions of genes in vertebrates. In normal cell functioning, DNA methylation of these CpG islands is associated with reduced gene expression.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancer cells, there is increased methylation or ‘hypermethylation’ of CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. The level of methylation increases over time as tumor growth progresses. </span>This leads to the reduced expression of these tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In combination with other DNA mutations and epimutations this can result in rapid growth of the cell and hence the development of a tumor.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cell functioning, methylation of repetitive elements and intragenic regions is important in maintaining genomic stability. This includes by suppressing illegitimate recombinations, movement of repeats and inappropriate activation of neighbouring genes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancer cells, there is decreased methylation or ‘hypomethylation’ at repetitive elements and intragenic regions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This leads the genome to become less stable which in turn leads to tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cell functioning, the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal chromosome is methylated. This methylation extends to the promoter region of the H19 gene which prevents expression of this gene. In addition, the enhancers downstream of H19 promote expression of the Igf2 gene.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cell functioning, the same ICR on the maternal chromosome is not methylated and as a result, the CTCF insulator protein is able to bind to the ICR. This protein prevents the downstream enhancers from enhancing the expression of the Igf2 gene and as a result the maternal copy of Igf2 is not expressed. In addition, because there is no methylation of the ICR the H19 promoter is also not methylated and as a result the maternal copy of the H19 gene is expressed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilm’s tumour cells, the H19 gene on the maternal chromosome is methylated as is normally only the case for the paternal chromosome. As a result the maternal H19 gene is not expressed but both the paternal and the maternal Igf2 genes are expressed. This is thought to cause genome instability and hence tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is a member of the DNA demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. It does this by inhibiting the effect of DNA methyltransferase which ordinarily catalyses the addition of methyl groups to DNA. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It does this as follows. Decitabine is first converted into </span><span>decitabine triphosphate in the cell. It is then integrated into DNA where it prevents the action of DNA methyltransferase directly. The resulting hypomethylation of the DNA is thought to restore the function of genes involved in regulating cell growth and division thus reducing tumour growth. Also the combined  Decitabine-DNA methyltransferase may induce cell death.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Because epigenetic state can be inherited, the changes in epigenetic state induced by drugs targeting the epigenome would likely persist in the somatic cells of the individual being treated. But the epigenome of this person’s offspring or even their grandchildren could be similarly impacted by the drugs.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A sensitive period with respect to epigenetics is a period in which there is substantial changes to the epigenome or in which the epigenome is particularly sensitive to external impacts. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The two key sensitive periods are during gametogenesis and the early development of the embryo.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Treating patients during such sensitive periods would be inadvisable as the normal processes involved in establishing the epigenome of the gametes or the early embryo would likely be disrupted in turn resulting in greater rates of developmental disorders.</span></p></div>
