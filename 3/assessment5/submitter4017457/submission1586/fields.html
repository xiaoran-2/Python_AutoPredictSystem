    <h1>Submission 1586 from Anon (session_user_id: 91138682a07e51e60dbf580f9c09e32b376c276e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Decitabine is a demethilating agent which belongs to the group of azanucleosides. It is a cytidine analog which can be incorporated into DNA substituting cytosine. This nucleotide analong is recognized by DNA methyltransferases but the methylation reaction will be blocked because of the substitution of a carbon by a nitrogen atom in the pirimidine ring. The mechanism of action of this drug consists on trapping DNA methyltransferases, which will be bound to the DNA but will not be able to drive a succesful methylation reaction. This results in a decrease of DNA methylation in the cell. The anti-tumour effect displayed by decitabine is based on its ability to revert hypermethylation-induced gene silencing in key tumor supressors and other cancer-related genes, which can therefore restore proliferation control in the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">The alteration of DNA methylation causes altered gene expression which commonly leads to the development of diseases such as cancer. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, and though it is reversible, it is also inheritable, so changes in the pattern of DNA methylation can produce enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sensitive periods are periods of time during development when the environment may be able to influence the epigenetic state of an organism. One of these periods where the organism is sensitive to epigenetic control comprises the time that goes from primordial germ cell formation to the production of mature gametes. Another sensitive period during development is the period comprised between the preimplantation and postimplantation of the embryo. Both are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Treating patients during sensitive periods would not be advisable because the epigenetic alterations that take place during these periods would be maintained after embryonic develpment or would be transgenerationally inherited in case these epigenetic modifications occur during germ cell development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">DNA methylation normally occurs at CpG islands in mammals, and is laid down by methyltransferases. This methylation occurs normally at promoters of genes, leading to silencing of gene expression. However, in cancer, DNA methylation may be disrupted by locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands. This hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer may silence the expression of tumor supressor genes which contributes to the development of the disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in disease-free cells thus promoting the maintenance of genomic stability by the silencing of repetitive regions which would be involved in genomic transposition or ilegitimate recombination. However, in cancer, those regions appear to be hypomethylated thus resulting in increased chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. This disruption of DNA methylation at those regions may produce aberrant gene expression and chromosome instability which can lead to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, which means that the ICR of the paternal allele is usually methylated while the maternal allele remains unmethylated promoting the binding of CTCF which is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This methylation at the maternal ICR promotes the enhancers to act on promoting H19 expression, which is a lncRNA produced from the maternal allele in a mechanism dependent on chromatin looping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the paternal allele, the binding of CTCF to the ICR is prevented due to the methylation of this region, so the enhancers are able to act on Igf2 region, promoting its expression from the paternal allele. The methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele can spread into the H19 promoter, thus silencing its expression. Igf2 is an oncogene, so its disruption by mutations or deletions that cause loss of imprinting can result in an uncontrolled cell proliferation. This loss of imprinting overexpressing growth promoting genes such as Igf2 can cause Wilm's tumour, which is a common feature of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome patients.</p></div>
