    <div class="field-value"><p>Most CpG islands in normal DNA are unmethylated and their main role is to act as a promoter for gene expression. Cancers, by contrast, are often associated with locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands and genome-wide hypomethylation in regions that are normally silenced, such as intergenic regions, repetitive elements and the introns of individual genes.<br /><br />The hypermethylation in cancers is almost invariably linked to specific CpG islands acting as promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which are then silenced so tumour suppressors are no longer produced. This type of hypermethylation has been found in virtually all cancers that have been studied so far and it has been postulated that this is one of the multiple 'hits' or insults to DNA that can result in tumorigenesis. CpG island hypermethylation is also involved in loss of imprinting, such as when the CpG island promoting the H19 gene in the Igf2/H19 cluster becomes methylated on the maternal as well as the paternal allele and is silenced.<br /><br />Hypermethylation of CpG islands is known to spread to the surrounding DNA or CpG island shores for up to 2kb in either direction and to increase with the progression of the tumour, while different tumours are linked to different methylation profiles.<br /><br />Conversely, hypomethylation results in tumours by allowing the expression of sections of the genome that are normally heavily methylated and silenced, such as oncogenes or the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation serves to silence and 'pack down' such regions - repetitive elements in particular - preventing their expression and their interaction with the rest of the DNA. When it is removed, this leads to genomic instability by allowing the transcription and transposition of repeats, illegitimate recombinations of chromosomes leading to deletions, insertions or translocations, or the activation of powerful hidden promoters that disrupt normal gene expression.<br /><br />Hypomethylation may also be responsible for loss of imprinting or, alternatively, the over activation of CpG poor promoters linked to either oncogenes or the blocking of tumour suppressors.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is commonly associated with tumours, possibly because imprinted genes tend to regulate growth factors. The H19/Igf2 cluster is a typical example of a gene with parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression that results in cancer when disrupted.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the Igf2 gene is only expressed on the paternal chromosome and not on the maternal chromosome due to differential methylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) and H19 gene. This comes about indirectly, through the blocking on the maternal chromosome of enhancers that act on Igf2 by the insulator element CTCF.</p>
<p>Since the ICR on the paternal chromosome is methylated, CTCF is unable to bind to the ICR and enhancers are able to act directly on Igf2 so that it is expressed. The methylation also spreads to H19 promoters, which are then silenced so that H19 is not expressed. The ICR is not methylated on the maternal chromosome, however, so that CTCF can bind and prevents enhancers from acting on Igf2, so that they activate H19 instead.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting in Wilm's tumour comes about when the ICRs on both the paternal and maternal chromosomes are methylated. This prevents the binding of CTCF on both and results in a 'double dose' of the oncogene Igf2, while there is no expression of H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors or DNMTi that act as demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Like others in its class, it is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA upon replication and then binds irreversibly to DNA methyl-transferases and prevents their action. This stops DMTs from attaching methyl marks to DNA and thus prevents gene silencing.</p>
<p>When used as a treatment for cancer, Decitabine probably reduces abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands activating tumour suppressor genes, allowing these proteins to be produced, and 'reactivates' the normal functioning of the genome as seen in healthy cells.</p>
<p>Since it is dependent on replication, it probably preferentially acts on cancer cells that replicate more rapidly and 'cures' them by removing hypermethylation and restoring more normal function. It is currently used to treat blood cancers known as Myelodysplasias and myelogenous leukemia but recent research has indicated that this class of drugs may be useful in solid tumours as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns in the epigenome are stable and mitotically heritable, usually lasting for the lifetime of an organism. Any changes made to methylation patterns are therefore permanent.</p>
<p>The effect of factors that make such changes is not the same throughout an organism's life cycle, however. Though all cells might potentially be affected by them, their impact is greatest on cells that are dividing rapidly, such as in cancer or when organisms are still developing, but less significant in adult organisms where epigenetic marks are simply maintained and resistant to change.</p>
<p>The times when changing the epigenome can have profound and lasting effects on an organism are termed sensitive periods. Such periods occur when the epigenome is being reprogrammed and previous marks are cleared so new ones can be laid down. Two such sensitive periods of reprogramming are in early embryonic development when cell lineages are being established and when primordial germ cells are still developing. </p>
<p>Since such drugs affect all cells, treating people with drugs acting on the epigenome during sensitive periods could have long-term repercussions that are hard to predict, both within the lifetime of the patient and transgenerationally. Therefore, their use on young children and pregnant women, when they might affect the growing fetus and still-developing germ cells, is not advisable.</p></div>
