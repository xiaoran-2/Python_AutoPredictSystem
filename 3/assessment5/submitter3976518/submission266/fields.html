    <div class="field-value"><p>In human cells CpG islands are CpG rich regions which are found within the promoter of about 60% of genes. In the case of CpG islands methylation of cytosines on these CpG dinucleotides acts as a repressive mark for gene silencing. This mechanism takes place on a series of physiological events such as X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting as well as the establishment of tissue specific expression patterns. In the cases of X inactivation and genomic imprinting CpG island methylation acts as a repressive mark ensuring the monoallelic expression of particular genes. <br /> In normal tissues most of these CpG islands are found hypomethylated. However this is not the case of cancer cells in which these specific regions experiment a dramatic increase in their methylation content leading to an aberrant silencing of several genes which in many cases act as tumor suppressors.</p>
<p>On the other hand DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents chromosomal instability by a serial of different mechanisms. For example it prevents the activation of these regions which could lead to an aberrant expression of the surrounding genes. It also can act removing these regions from the expression machinery by creating regions of heterochromatin. Finally methylation of cytosines within these regions increases the number of spontaneous mutations on these sequence fragments decreasing the probability for illegitimate homologous recombinations. These regions which in normal cells would be heavily methylated become hypomethylated in cancer cells. This phenomena leads to an increase in the number of genomic translocations, deletions and insertions as well as overexpression or downregulation of particular genes, all of them causes of genomic instability and characteristic events in cancer progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most imprinted genes are growth related genes which expression is restricted to one parental allele. The expression of each of these genes is controlled by an imprinting control region (ICR) that shows different methylation patterns between both maternal and paternal alleles. These differential methylation profiles between both alleles ensure the expression of only one copy of the gene. In the case of ICRs methylation can lead either to activation or silencing depending on the gene or cluster on which each ICR acts.<br /> As an example, H19/Igf2 is a cluster which expression is controlled by an ICR. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene that in normal tissues is only expressed from the paternal allele.  This is because methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele prevents binding of CTCF on this region allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 and for instance activating its expression. That is not the case for the maternal allele in which the lack of methylation on the ICR allows CTCF to bind, attracting the enhancers towards the expression of H19. In the case of Wilm’s tumor ICRs in both alleles are methylated what leads to an overexpression of the Igf2 growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases. By inhibiting these enzymes this drug prevents methylation of DNA sequences to occur. On one hand, this feature could be used to restore the expression of particular tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation of their promoters in particular types of cancer. This can have a beneficial effect in terms of slowing tumor progression and growth as well as inducing apoptosis. On the other hand, due to its complete lack for sequence specificity this drug also acts on genomic regions normally methylated such as imprinting control regions, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. As explained above, the loss of methylation within these regions increases genomic instability. Nevertheless the impossibility to direct the delivery of the drug only to the malignant cells makes every single cell in the organism potentially susceptible of suffering the consequences of this genomic instability, including germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. On this sense, drugs that prevent the action of the methylation machinery even for a short period of time will establish new epigenetic signatures that will remain on the next generations of cells.<br /> In this case we could define a sensitive period as a period of time in which the action of a particular drug could lead to very negative consequences on the future patient outcome.<br /> There are two periods that appear to be extremely sensitive in terms of DNA methylation, preimplantation period and primordial germ cell development period. These two cases are considered sensitive periods because a very active remodeling of the epigenetic landscape takes place during them. There is an almost complete clearance of methylation during the first cell divisions after fertilization followed by the establishment of a genome wide methylation pattern including imprinted regions as well as X inactivation, which would remain almost unchanged in all somatic cells. In the case of primordial germ cell development, these cells experiment dramatic epigenetic changes necessary for the development of gametocytes. For instance treating patients on one of these two periods would lead either to teratogenic effects or irreversible heritable epigenetic defects.</p></div>
