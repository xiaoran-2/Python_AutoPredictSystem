    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is the addition of a methyl group  within the CpG dinucleotide. The areas defined "CpG Island" and formed by segments of DNA of 200 bp or more with a content of G and C of 50%; these areas are near the 5 'end of the genes, in many cases upstream of a promoter, and their methylation state participates in the control of the gene  expression. The main consequence of DNA methylation is the alteration of the degree of compactness of the chromatin in which, in normal condition, the DNA is organized. A more compact chromatin, due to the presence of promoters and ipermetilated with deacetylated histones, excludes the transcriptional apparatus of the cell and it turns off the gene expression.<br />The  alteration of epigenetic mechanisms can produces the  silencing of oncosuppressor genes, activation of oncogenes.<br />the alteration of methylation in cancer by hypomethylation can determine the expression of inserts oncoviralis, the expression of genes subjected to imprinting, chromosomal instability; by hypermethylation can determine inactivation of genes involved in regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, inactivation of onco suppressor. <br />DNA methylation is frequently disrupted in cancer:  typically cancer cells display hypomethylation across the genome, attributed to the loss of  methylation at repetitive elements, whereas methylation at gene promoter regions is increased.  Particularly, tumour suppressor genes are commonly silenced by hypermethylation of their promoter  regions as an alternative to loss-of-function mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting  can be of maternal origin, in this case the maternal allele is silenced and expressed the paternal allele or,  of paternal origin, if the paternal allele is silenced and expressed maternal allele. Examples of human genes subjected to imprinting are: 1) the gene coding for insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-2), subjected to maternal imprinting, 2) the gene H19 instead subjected to paternal imprinting. H19 is expressed in the maternal chromosome, while Igf2 is inhibited by the binding of proteins CTFC insulator. In the paternal chromosome is expressed Igf2 and H19 is suppressed due to methylation of the H19 promoter and insulator. In normal  individuals. <em>IGF2</em> expression is from the paternal allele and <em>H19</em> is from the maternal allele. IC1(Imprint Control region )and DMR0 (Differentially methylated regions) are methylated on the paternal chromosome. In the Wilms tumour, <em>IGF2</em>activation and <em>H19</em> silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints (somatic loss of imprinting), so it means that  in this cancer both parental marks are lost and reprogrammed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The authors says that many genes have an epigenetic regulation, essentially chemical, and thus open the way to a pharmacological intervention even on the cancer, which often has an epigenetic component Among other substances presented, which act on the hyper-methylation of the DNA, they present a particular substance, the decitabine, (and azaticidine) belongs to  DNA-demethylating agents.They report that a group of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine reserchers have  experienced an association of a histone-deacetylase inhibitors with azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This is significant because this is the first epigenetic drug used successfully,and, also, some people have shown a good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs. The hypothesis of researchers is that once erased epigenetic changes, they don’t return, so, in some case, this could stop a cancer growing without having to kill all cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation need to maintain a scheme of gene expression. This process occurs almost exclusively through the binding of a methyl group in position 5 of the cytosine present in CpG dinucleotide sequences of DNA, by the family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes. DNA methylation is maintained by specific DNAmethyltransferases (DNMT1, 3a and 3b). The methylation pattern is passed into dividing somatic cells the genetic code. DNMT1 works together with the protein UHRF1 ,that  detects CpG sites methylated only on a single DNA strand . An alteration of the methylation status involves a structural change (DNA hypermethylation : CpG islands and CpG islands shores of tumour, ICRs-loss of imprinting and/or Genome –Wide DNA hypomethylation in repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters ), resulting in genomic instability .</p>
<p>So to act on methylation can think of intervening on enzymes that regulate it. The introduction of drugs to target epigenetic regulators enzymatic promises valid results because the enzymes are more easily adjustable by small molecules of  inhibitors.</p>
<p>An example is DNMT inhibitors:  Decitabine and Vidoza, nucleoside analogues that bind irreversibly DNMT after they have been incorporated in  DNA. The mechanism is therefore replication dependent.</p>
<p>Must be particularly cautious in the application of this technique in younger patients and should consider the  effects on germ cells.</p></div>
