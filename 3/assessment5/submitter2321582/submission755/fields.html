    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands normally silences gene expression by blocking transcription, either chemical or physically. In cancer, CpG islands can become demethylated (hypomethylated) causing inappropriate gene expression, or hypermethylated causing inappropriate gene silencing. If the CpG islands are hypomethylated, it can allow a genes to become oncogenes, which tell cells to divide too much and/or not die, becoming tumors, due to general chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. If they are hypermethylated, they can silence tumor suppressor genes allowing cells to divide out of control. Normally, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements  keeps the genome stable and protect it from transposable elements. Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions creates genomic instability due to loss of imprinting. Which leads to illegitimate recombination, such as the swapping of chromosome pieces, because without proper methylation, chromatin opens up and is vulnerable. Genes can then copy and jump around the genome causing strange things to happen in other genes. Also, inappropriate deletions and insertions can occur. This can lead to disease because without the right instructions, genes can’t tell cells to do what they are supposed to, which can lead them to go crazy and/or not die, creating tumors. Genes are like the hardware, the epigenics is like the software, and basically, methylation errors hack into the programming and cause things to go awry in the form of cancer and disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> IGF2 is located upstream from H19 on chromosome 11, and in between them is an imprint control region that binds CTCF proteins, which insulates IGF2 from enhancers. On the paternal allele, the ICR is imprinted and methylated having escaped epigenetic reporgraming early in embryonic development, so there’s no CTCF. Without CTCF,  downstream enhancers act on the IGF2 gene promoting fetal growth. Also without CTCF,  methylation spreads to H19, silencing it.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, blocking downstream enhancers from enhancing IGF2, limiting growth proteins, effectively silencing this gene on the maternal allele. Because those downstream enhancers can’t get to the IGF2, they act on H19 instead. So, basically, on the maternal allele, IGF2 is silent, whereas H19 is active, and the opposite is true on the paternal allele. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by loss of paternal imprinting, in which there is uniparental disomy, where two copies of the paternal allele are inherited and none from the mother. So a zygote gets no active KCNQ1, a nearby growth suppressor, and an upregulated IGF2, resulting in all growth, and no suppression. Among other abnormalities, children may develop Wilm’s tumors in their kidneys, but not adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known DNMTi, or DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It is used to treat myelodysplasitic syndrome which has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is a blood cancer or malignancy. The DMNTi drugs are nucleoside analogues and become part of the DNA during replication and become part of the daughter strand. Then when the DNMT comes along to copy the methylation mark onto the daughter strand, the “decoy” drug nucleoside traps it and prevents it from going out and methylating things. Without DMNT, there can be no methylation, therefore, it allows genes to be expressed.  Although the exact  mechanisms are unclear, Decitabine may have an anti-tumor effect because blood cancers are depending on tumor suppressor gene deactivation due to hypermethylation. By reversing that hypermethylation, the tumor suppressor genes can then be expressed, thereby suppressing the tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects in the epigenome because these methylation marks become mitotically heritable, being passed down to the daughter cells for the life of the organism. So, if a dose of a drug is administered for a certain period of time, and the epigenome is altered, those alterations will remain even after the drug is no longer being introduced into the patient’s body. There is concern about administration of such drugs to younger people who may have developing germ cells, because the drugs will interact with all cells of the body. There are sensitive periods in development when the action of these drugs could be particularly troublesome.  A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprograming is occurring right after fertilization for the paternal genome and around blastocyst formation for the maternal genome, and then again as the primordial germ cells are forming. If younger people are given demethylating drugs during pgc formation, for example, it can impact the epigenome of their offspring, potentially causing developmental problems for future generations.</p></div>
