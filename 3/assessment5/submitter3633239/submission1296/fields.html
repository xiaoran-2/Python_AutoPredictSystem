    <h1>Submission 1296 from Anon (session_user_id: 6569e490d9f1405fb4c023c3094fa025027dd1e3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits the DNA methylation by inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferase. This drug blocks the action of DNMT1, so DNMT1 wont be available to be used during replication in other strands of DNA, so gradually the DNA in that cell will be completely demethylated. In this process, the suppressor genes are restored and with it the control over cell growth. Also, this drug interacts with some metabolites within the cell and causes cytotoxic effect, cell death. So by taking over control or promoting cell death, Decitabine helps treat cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the methylation at CpG islands is in the 5' group of cytosines within that dinucleotide, and it occurs symmetrically on the DNA strand. This action has the effect of silencing gene expression (and by that control of the cell). In cancer cells, there is a hypermethylation in CpG islands that represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes (silencing gene expression). The exccessive silencing of gene expression, the cell growth is no longer controlled so it quickly becomes a tumor. </p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements it's the opposite situation. In normal cases this regions of DNA are methylated, but in cancer cells this regions are hypomethylated. This action causes genome instability (when intergenic regions are demethylated) that leads to a growing cell without any control, leading to tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs restore methylation patterns by blocking the action of certain enzymes (DNMT1, for example), this action effects are passed to daughter cells during cell division, because epigenetic changes are passed during the division process. So, during the division process the methylation will be erased and restored until the cells 'become' normal again. The sensitive period, is the period of important <span>development </span>during which the treatment can affect future generations. Example of sensitive periods are pregnancy (early stages), and in this case the treatment would be inadvisable because it can be harmful to fertility. A person who do the treatment during a sensitive period can become infertile or (if already pregnant) can affect the embryo permanently. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally H19 promoter is methylated on the paternal allele but is being expressed (demethylated) on the maternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed by the paternal allele but not the maternal. In Wilm's tumour there is a hypermethylation od the DNA, so the maternal allele is now methylated too causing an Igf2 overexpression. This overexpression leads to cellular proliferation and (as some studies have shown) an increase on the <span>efficiency of tumor formation. </span></p></div>
