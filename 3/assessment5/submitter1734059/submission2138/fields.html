    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals and is a key epigenetic modification in the human genome crucial for regulation of several cellular processes including gene expression, X chromosome inactivation, imprinting, silencing of transposable elements, and chromatin organization.  DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is symmetrical and copied mitotically and maintained through cell division which is laid down by de novo methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b during development. CpG islands are often located around the promoters of housekeeping genes and are protected from methylation.  A small subset of genes where CpG islands are methylated relates to silencing of gene expression. Methylation at CpG island is mainly studies for the inactive X- chromosome, for example coat color in Calico cats. </p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands is frequently observed in cancer and is responsible for contributing to tumor progression by silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes due to promoter hypermethylation. CpG methylation leads to silencing of genes by two mechanisms; (1) formation of a repressive chromatin structure e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2; (2) prohibiting transcription factor binding.  Another form of DNA methylation defect in many types of cancer is genomic hypomethylation. Aberrant hypomethylation has been hypothesized to contribute to cancer progression by activating oncogenes or by increasing chromosome instability .</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. For e.g. Dnmt1 null cells exhibit abnormal karyotype due to genomic instability. In the case of repetitive elements, function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome from transposable elements (Genome defense model by Prof. Timothy Bestor) and to prevent illegitimate recombination events. In cancer, epigenetic aberration found was a genome wide lack of methylation i.e. intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans, proper expression of imprinted genes is important for normal development. The H19/Igf2 cluster is the well-documented example of genomic imprinting located at chromosome 11p15.5 in the human genome. Imprint control region (ICR) present upstream of H19 TSS is required to block enhancer activity for H19 and Igf2 genes and contains CTCF-binding sites that are required for this activity. CTCF is an insulator protein, insulate Igf2 from enhancers. On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at ICR block binding of CTCF, therefore enhancers are free to interact with the Igf2 promoter, and the H19 promoter is repressed. In contrast, on the maternal allele, presence of CTCF blocks the enhancer from interacting with Igf2 promoter and silences gene expression.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster is associated with reduced expression and Hypermethylation of H19 in Wilm’s tumour which contributes to the development of embryonal tumors. Also, disruption of imprinting and abnormal methyaltion at the H19/Igf2 cluster at chromosome 11q15.5 leads to Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome characterized by fetal or postnatal overgrowth, larger tounge, predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors. This syndrome results from loss of tumor suppressor (Cdkn1c), upregulation of oncogenes (Igf2 ), and uniparental disomy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A number of drugs that affect epigenetic processes include; GSK2816126, a novel inhibitor of EZH2 (enzyme involved in transcriptional repression of genes) used for the treatment of lymphoma. Another drug named JQ1, blocks the activity of <em>Myc</em> by inhibiting a epigenetic regulator BRD involved in suppressing the proliferation of myeloma cells. Other class of epigenetic drugs includes DNA demethylating agents, in the form of Azacitidine and Decitabine used for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Also, histone-deacetylase inhibitors are used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Decitabine causes hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or cell death. Decitabine exert its anti-tumor effects by phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main goals of epigenetic therapy are to selectively kill cancerous cells and prevent recurrence of malignancy by alteration of a normal DNA methylation pattern. Altering the DNA methylation patterns can cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes by activation of oncogenes and chromosome instability (DNA hypermethylation), and silencing of tumor suppressor genes (DNA hypermethylation) which in turn could lead to irreversible effect on the epigenome.  According to Dr. Baylin research,  epigenetic drugs such as azacitidine combined with entinostat used to treat patients with advanced lung cancer could lead to strong tumor responses which continued even after treatment was stopped in some cases. Drugs used for epigenetic therapies could affect the structure of chromatin, which could cause side effects over a long period in cancer patients. Other part of problem treating patients with these epigenetic drugs circles around the sensitive period. A sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, for example in case of germ cell vs somatic cell development, somatic cell-sensitive periods in which environmental signals produce epigenetic changes are numerous in contrast to germ cells. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as epigenetic marks may be transmitted transgernerationlly. </p></div>
