    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell, CpG islands are associated with promoters of tumor suppression genes that control the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. In the cancer cell, these CpG islands are hyper methylated with loss of function of these tumor suppressor genes. Loss of function of the tumor suppressor genes results in uncontrolled growth by oncogenes.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hyper methylated in the normal cell. These areas promote genomic stability and oncogene inactivation. In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypo methylated and lose their cancer prevention properties. This leads to increased genomic instability and oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is common in cancer. An example of this effect of loss of imprinting is the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11. The ICR for the paternal allele is methylated in the normal genome. The H19 promoter on the paternal allele is methylated. The permits unrestricted action by downstream enhancers on the Igf2 locus.</p>
<p>The ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated in the normal genome. The H19 promoter in the maternal allele is not methylated. This allows the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, to the ICR site. This blocks the effect of the downstream enhancers on Igf2. The H19 promoter produces a lnRNA that silences the downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of the maternal allele. There are two copies of the paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 locus. There is no binding of the CTCF insulator protein at the ICR. There is no H19 promoter to silence the downstream enhancers. This leads to unrestricted stimulation by the enhancers of the Igf2 locus. Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. This drug inhibits DNA methylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNA methyl groups after they are incorporated into DNA. The exact mechanism action of this drug is not known. However, this drug is most effective against hematologic malignancies and may have an effect on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin's study was able to show that an epigenetic drug combination slowed tumor growth in patients with advanced lung cancer. Poor responders to this regimen were subsequently found to have improved results when given routine chemotherapeutic drugs. The study speculated " that the epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting way and made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy".</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes in the genome can certainly be passed on to daughter cells by DNA methyl transferases.The sensitive period occurs during primordial germ cell development and in early embryo development. These are periods when the genome undergoes extensive de methylation to remove the epigenetic markers. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs that might interfere with this process could have untoward effects on cell differentiation and cell growth.</p></div>
