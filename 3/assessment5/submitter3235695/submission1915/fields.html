    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are DNA regions rich in C and G dinucleotide and usually in normal cells they are unmethylated and its belived that the methylation of these sites within promoter regions can contribute to spreading of the methylation throught a 2Kb region and a subsquent inhibition of gene expression. More recent hallmarks described for cancer gave more importance to the epigenetic within tumorigenesis. And one epigenetic changes described is related with the fact that although in cancer cells is seen a genome wide hypomethylation there is a locus specific hypermethylation in CpG islands namely the ones within tumor supressor genes promoter regions. This alteration promotes a decrease of tumor supressor genes expression and associated with other damaged of the cells can lead to the generation of a cancer. These other alterations can be, namely, hypomethylation within intergenic regions and repetitive elements that will contribute to a high genomic instability promoting the occurence of deletions, mutations and translocations that all together might end in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control of gene expression is very important and its deregulation can have massive consequences.There is a very known example of failed imprinting control related with Wilm's tumor. In normal cases H19 and Igf2 expression is controled by a imprinting control region (ICR) . Within the allele where is methylation of the ICR (paternal) there is no binding of the insulator (CTCF) and therefore the enhancer will induce the expression of Igf2 within this allele. In the other hand, within the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and the CTCF will bind to this region and therefore the enhancers will not act within Igf2 expression but rather within this allele there is expression of H19. </p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal ICR will be hypermethylated and there will occur a amplified expression of Igf2 (2 times more than normal) since the CTCF is not able to bind to the maternal ICR. This change in expression will have an impact in terms of regulation of normal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent and it inhibits the methylation of DNA by DNA methyltransferases. Hypermethylation is increased with tumorigenicity and usually cancers with high methylation profiles have worse clinical prognosis. The decrease of methylation within the genome can in one hand promote a rescue some expression of supressor tumor genes (that can be inactivated by methylation on CpG within theirs promoters) and in other hand try to re-establish the some degree of genomic stability that the cell has loose during this process.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is an epigenetic alteration that can be passed to the progeny. Therefore early embrionic development and during the germ cell development where the epigenetic marks are cleared and sumbited to a resetting process are sensitive periods of development where the cells are particularly susceptible to the environment in terms of epigenetics. </p>
<p>Having in consideration the aboved mentioned is easy to understand that altering a reversible process (DNA methylation) within the cancer scenario where there are many irreversible damages can have an enduring effect on the epigenome. And has this alteration of epigenome profile can be transmitted to next generations. Moreover since during the sensitive periods of the development there is a clearing and resetting of the epigenetic modifications is not advised treating patients with DNA demethylating agents, histone deacetylating agents or other epigenetic modifiers because they will copromise the normal epigenetic profile of the entire genome of the cell and not just specific modifications.</p>
