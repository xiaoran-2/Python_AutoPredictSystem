    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is the backbone of the nucleus. It must not only duplicate itself during replication, it must regulate gene activation/suppression and repair itself. Methylation of DNA is a major source of gene control. At any given time, most genes are inactive, and methylation of CpG nucleotides is usually associated with suppression. Furthermore, these marks are heritable during cell division.</p>
<p>Cancer disrupts the normal organization of both the cell and the organisim. At the nuclear level, many of the CpG methylation marks in the genome become demethylated. This genome wide hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability. The chromatin becomes unpacked and open to transcriptases. This hypomethylation can be at locus specific regions, such as imprint control regions (ICR), or it can be in the intergenic and repetitive elements, or in the genes themselves (introns). This euchromatin is then subject to deletions, duplications, translocations, and insertions. These can all act to disrupt the normal cellular equilibrium resulting in over/under-expression of mRNA, non-coding RNA, histones, and a disorganized nuclear scaffold. In general, cancer results when there is over expression of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppresors.</p>
<p>Many tumor suppressor genes appear to controlled or influenced by CpG islands and the adjacent 2kb island shores. The islands are not usually methylated, but in cancer they become methylated and the result is inactivation of tumor suppressors. Certain islands and shores can be disease specific--some island methylation is only seen in specific solid tumors and myelodysplasias. This raises the possibility of using these biomarkers to screen, diagnose, stage, and follow the clinical course of many tumors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that effect DNA methylation can have lasting effects because methylation marks are heritable and passed on to the daughter cells. Dnmt1 is necessary for development and its absence is a lethal mutation. However, there are two periods in development that Dnmt1 is relatively silent as the methylation marks are reset--in the first few days of life (preimplantation) and in the germ cells (gamete formation). The chromatin is opened up during these "sensitive" periods so that the cells can be pluripotent stem cells. Once differentiation begins to occur, the chromatin begins to be repackaged in tissue specific ways. This is done in large part by methylation of CpGs.</p>
<p>This resetting of the genome is necessary for development. If the DNA were to be methylated too soon, this would lead to aberrant development of stem cells in the embryo. This could have disastrous consequences for cell differentiation as these premature methylation marks would be passed on to all of the daughter cells and tissue formation would almost certainly be abherent. Similarly, if these drugs were used in times of fertility, the gametes could be significantly altered.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes involve growth and development. These genes include promoters and suppressors of growth. Their regulation is necessary for normal development. In most cases, the ICR is expressed in only one allele, the paternal or maternal. Expression usually is usually the result of hypomethylation of the ICR in one allele, but occasionally is the result of hypermethylation of the ICR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One such growth gene is lgf2. When its ICR is methylated, it is expressed. When the ICR promoter is not methylated, it can bind CTCF which then blocks promotion and expression of lgf2. In most cases, the paternal allele is methylated and expressed, but the maternal allele is unmethylated and blocked by CTCF. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is methylated in both copies allowing for expression of both copies of lgf2. The H19 locus is also methylated in both copies, so the enhancer molecule is also blocked.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) blocks methylation of DNA, so if a certain type of cancer is associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores, blockage of Dnmt's could be of therapeutic benefit. Decitabine is a nucleotide analogue that is incorporated into the DNA of actively dividing cells. Once inside the genome, it irreversibly binds Dnmt and thereby inhibits further epigenetic methylation of the genome, including CpG islands that are necessary for cancer growth. Myelodysplastic tumors are noted for the presence of hypermethylated CpG islands, so once these promoters are relatively silenced by hypomethylation, cell growth should be inhibited downstream. Unfortunately, this effect on Dnmt's is not limited to the cancer cells--any dividing cell can be effected, and this drug should be avoided in "sensitive" periods. It's risk should be negatively correlated with age--the older the patient, the safer the drug.</p></div>
