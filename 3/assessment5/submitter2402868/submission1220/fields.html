    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a normal activity in cells - methyl groups may attach to histones at various points along DNA. The consequences of methylation depends upon the type of site on the chromosome at which the methylation occurs. Methylation may or may not occur at different locations on DNA in normal cells. Conversely, cancers may arise due to either excessive methylation (hypermethylation) or insufficient methylation (hypomethylation). These two alterations to normal methylation are described below.</p>
<p>When CpG islands become methylated, they can silence the expression of genes located nearby on the chromosome. A normal non-cancerous cell will allow some genes to be expressed while silencing others. In some cancers, CpG islands that should remain unmethylated end up becoming hypermethylated and thus, in turn, silence genes that should normally be expressed. These silenced genes are often tumour-suppressing genes that would normally prevent a cancer from growing or spreading.</p>
<p>At other sites on the chromosome, such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation assists in expressing genes. In a normally functioning cell, many of these sites are methylated in order to express certain genes. In some cancers, such sites become hypomethylated.  This, in turn, leads to various transcriptional errors such as additional deletions, additional insertions or reciprocal translocations, some of which can contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some cancers arise through overly methylated histones that end up silencing tumour-suppressing genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which is used to treat myelodysplastc syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>As a DNA-demethylating agent, decitabine's method of action is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>The ultimate impact of this hypomethylation is to activate the tumour-suppressing gense which had previously been silenced by the hypermethylated histones.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Under normal circumstances the H19/Igf2 cluster of genes behaves in the following manner.</p>
<p>The paternal allele would normally have the control region for the H19 gene methylated thus preventing H19 from being expressed. The paternal allele would also normally have the imprint control region methylated thus preventing CTCF from binding. This, in turn, allows the enhancers to act on the Igf2 control region, resulting in Igf2 being expressed.</p>
<p>The maternal allele, on the other hand, would normally have both the imprint control region and the H19 control region unmethylated. An unmethylated imprint control region allows CTCF to bind and, in turn, act as an insulator which keeps Igf2 silent. Since the control region for H19 is also unmethylated, the enhancers can act on it and H19 gets expressed.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and the maternal allele expresses H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted by the maternal allele being hypermethylated so that it behaves similarly to the paternal allele as described above.</p>
<p>The end result is that H19 remains silent and Igf2 is doubly expressed. Igf2, being a growth promoter, helps contribute to the growth of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is a modification at the epigenetic level. As such, it is mitotically heritable and can be passed down from mother to daughter and granddaughter cells through mitotic cell division.</p>
<p>Such methylation remains in place until it is actively removed. Active removal can only take place during a "sensitive period". Sensitive periods are the developmental times during which methylation resetting takes place.  These are the very early developmental stage immediately after fertilisation and the stage at which gametes are formed in the adult.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because any changes to methylation caused by treatment would be immediately reset; i.e. treatment would be nullified.</p></div>
