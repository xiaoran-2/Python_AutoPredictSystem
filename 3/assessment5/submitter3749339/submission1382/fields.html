    <div class="field-value"><p>Question 1:<br /><br /> In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated.  Methylation of 'shore regions' is related to gene expression, thus one might surmise that the normal _function_ of CpG islands is methylation dependant control of gene expression, with control from the 'shore' toward the center of the island.  <br /><br /> In cancer cells, local CpG islands are hypermethylated and strongly suppress gene expression.<br /><br /> The hypermethylation of CpG islands suppresses genes which might otherwise prevent the growth of the cancer.<br /><br /> In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated.  This helps suppress transcription of genetic 'noise', and also helps maintain genetic stability by preventing aberrant recombination at repetitive elements. <br /><br /> In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically hypomethylated.  This in turn leads to greater activity in these regions.<br /><br /> The reduced methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genetic instability, which may lead to different cancer cells having different levels of malignancy or 'robustness'.  This could lead to more malignant cancer by 'natural selection'.<br /><br /> (References used: Week 6 lectures and Hassler et. al)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some imprinted genes select between two sets of alleles, one paternal and one maternal.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele.  This prevents CTCF from binding the ICR.  This permits downstream enhancers to induce the expression of Igf2.  Methylation from the ICR also spreads to H19 and prevents its expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ICR is non-methylated on the maternal allele.  This permits CTCF to bind the ICR.  CTCF is an insulator protein and blocks the effects of the enhancers on Igf2.  Methylation does not spread to H19, thus it is expressed.<br /><br /> The result is that paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 get expressed.<br /><br /> The week 4 lectures give the example of Beckwith Weidemann syndrome, which is caused by several different disruptions in the Igf2/H19 region.   This causes expression of 2 copies of Igf2, a growth inducer, as well as loss of Cdkn1c expression, a growth suppressor.   This incorrect gene expression causes a predisposition to childhood tumours such as Wilm's tumour in the kidney.<br /><br /> Cancer induced epigenetic changes in this ICR, eg hypermethylation of the ICR would be expected to by oncogenic.<br /><br /> (References used Week 4 and Week 6 lectures)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is called a DNA-demethylating agent in the Economist article, and is identified as a DNA MethylTransferase Inhibitor in course notes.   <br /><br /> DNMTs function by copying DNA methylation to daughter DNA strands when cells replicate.  A DNMT inhibitor such as Decitabine prevents this DNA copying.  Decitabine functions by taking the place of a nucleotide in DNA and trapping the DNMT.   Inhibiting this function causes progressive generations of daughter cells to lose DNA methylation.  <br /><br /> Decitabine has strongest effect in rapidly dividing cells (such as cancer), and reduces the over-all methylation of the DNA in the cells.   It likely reduces both desired and undesired methylation, and its benefit is likely to be dependant on the particular cancer being treated.<br /><br /> (References used: Week 6 lectures, Economist article, wikipedia article on DNA MethylTransferases)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Question 4:<br /><br /> DNA methylation is a core mechanism of epigenetics.  When DNA is replicated, DNA MethylTransferase enzymes function to copy the methylation state.  Thus changes in DNA methylation may be passed to daughter cells.  If a drug changes the DNA methylation, this change in 'epigenetic state' will very likely be passed on to daughter cells, perhaps altering their susceptibility to other drugs.<br /><br /> A sensitive period in development is one in which there is expected to be rapid changes in DNA methylation state.  <br /><br /> Such periods are found in early development, and in the development of germ cells.  In particular, periods of early gestation are sensitive to epigenetic insults.  Furthermore, the formation of sperm and eggs is sensitive.<br /><br /> One might avoid the use of epigenetic drugs during such sensitive periods, in order to avoid side effects caused by pervasive epigenetic changes.  In the case of germ cell development, one might treat patients only if they are not going to have future children.<br /><br /> (References used: Week 1 and Week 6 lectures)</p></div>
