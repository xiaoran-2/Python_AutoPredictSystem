    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">The normal function of methylation at CpG islands is the silencing of gene expression. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Silencing of certain genes is essential for tissue differentiation and for control of certain genes on a parent-specific gene in the form of imprinting. It appears that CpG island methylation helps maintain genomic stability, as cells in which DNA methyl transferase 1 is inactive display genomic instability.  The ‘genome defense model’ proposes that CpG island methylation protects the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In normal cells tumour suppressor genes, those controlling functions such as limiting cell growth, promoting apoptosis (programmed cell death) and DNA repair, are hypomethylated and active. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands and their shores in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes silences them, allowing for the survival and growth of abnormal cells.  CpG island hypermethylation has been found in most types of tumour.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Tumour suppressor genes regulate growth and cell apoptosis and their silencing results in hyperplasia (unregulated growth) of the affected cells.  Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities can accumulate, resulting in tumours and often in the metastasis of these tumours.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silence their activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer through demethylation.  Although hypermethylation of CpG islands is generally found in cancer, genome-wide there is an overall reduction in DNA methylation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions causes genomic instability. including illegitimate combination between repeats, activation of repeats, transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At the chromosome level this involves deletions, insertions and translocations.  At the level of the gene, tumour suppressor can be silenced and cancer-promoting oncogenes activated. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is associated with oncogene activation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">The imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated.  This methylation silences the H19 promoter. Distal enhancers can then activate lgf2, promoting cell growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> The maternal allele of the H19/lgf2 cluster is normally unmethylated, allowing the protein CTFC to bind to the ICR, insulating the maternal Igf2 from enhancers and thereby silencing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Wilm’s Tumour appears to result from loss of imprinting of the maternal allele of the H19/ Igf2 cluster. Hypermethylation of the maternal allele’s ICR blocks binding of the insulator protein CTFC.  This allows enhancers to access the maternal Igf2 allele and promote its expression.  Where both parental Igf2 alleles are active, there is an excess of growth promoter, which can lead to tumour development. Genetic changes can also silence the maternal ICR.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster silences the maternal ICR allele, allowing overexpression of Igf2 and excessive cell growth.  This causes a spectrum of disorders known as Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.  This can include Wilm’s Tumour and other types of tumours, low blood sugar in infancy, uneven growth of parts of the body, overgrowth of the tongue, large abdominal organs and kidney abnormalities.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and azacitidine are cytidine analogues belonging to a class of drugs known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. There are other DNA methyltransferase inhibitors which are not nucleoside analogues.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Decitabine and azacitidine are used as epigenetic modifiers to treat certain cancers and precancerous conditions, including myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> DNA methyl transferases transfer a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the C-5 position of cytosine.  By inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferase, these drugs act to demethylate CpG dinucleotides in DNA.  These CpGs become demethylated in the process of mitosis as hemi-methylated CpG cannot be methylated when DNMT1 is inhibited. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect by reactivating epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes such as p15, through the demethylation of CpG islands in their promoters.  It also seems to have an anti-tumour effect by inducing apoptosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Altering DNA methylation, either through methylation of normally unmethylated sites, or demethylation of normally methylated sites, can alter gene expression. Changes in DNA methylation can endure as they are mitotically heritable, i.e. they are maintained in cell division.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The use of drugs which inhibit DNA Methyl Transferase can restore the function of tumour suppressor genes.  This can reduce the tumours growth, particularly if combined with other treatments. Heritable epigenetic changes can result in effects of the drugs lasting beyond the period of administration.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic marks are being altered. These periods include the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation, in the development of primordial germ cells and the formation of gametes, and in early embryonic development.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> These sensitive periods therefore include the ‘slow growth period’ pre-puberty in humans when germ cells are developing, the period leading up to conception and embryonic development before birth.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> Treating patients with drugs during sensitive periods with drugs that alter DNA methylation is inadvisable because of the risk of permanent changes in gene expression in a variety of tissues, including alteration in parental imprinting and effects on future generations</p>
