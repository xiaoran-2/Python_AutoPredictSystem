    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally at CpG islands there is hypomethylation, generally these islands occurring at or near promoter regions of genes.  In cancer this can be disrupted by hypermethylation of these regions where gene expression normally occurs.  By silencing these regions, it can have a significant affect on tumor suppressor genes that play a role in such things as DNA repair for example the mismatch repair gene MLH1.  Silencing of  a tumor suppressor gene by hypermethylation of these regions that was normally hypomethylated can also lead to an additional hit (relating to knudson hypothysis) which can lead to further cancer progression of a cell that was already initiated by a first mutation. </p>
<p>Intergenomic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are normally hypermethylated to help create genomic stability.  These regions are found to be hypomethylated in cancer.  Because of this hypomethylation, in repetitive elements this can lead to illegitimate recombinations between similar regions, and chromosomal instability such things as deletions and translocations and loss or gain of chromosomes in the replicated cells.  Hypomethylated repeats can also make copies of themselves and jump around to other areas of the genome “transpose” and jump into and disrupt the coding region of a gene themselves or can activate neighboring genes.  By jumping into a functional tumor suppressor gene it can damage the expression of that gene, such as perhaps a DNA repair gene which can lead to further mutations within the genome.  Certain aberrant rearrangements due to Hypomethylation can create a change in a genes expression, such as overexpression of a gene that regulates growth of a cell causing a cell to grow out of control. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated so CTCF cannot bind to this region which allows enhancers to act on Igf2 and enhance expression of Igf2.  On the Maternal allele, the imprint control region in unmethylated, this allows CTCF to bind to this region, and allows enhancers to act on H19 instead, which leads to Igf2 silencing.  In Wilm's tumor loss of imprinting you can have hyprmethylation of both imprint control regions which does not allow CTCF to bind leading to both allele's expression of Igf2 and creating a double dose effect.  The expression of Igf2 is growth promoting, the gene regulates cell growth, which increased expression therefore can  lead to increased/overcontrol of cellular growth, a cell that may already have an initial first hit mutation or many hits already.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor a nucleoside analogue, which incorporates into DNA upon replication and when DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotide then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.  This process is dependent on cellular division needing the cell to replicate and work well on cancer cells that are dividing more rapidly.  This drug can have an antitumor affect on preventing methylation to CpG island regions of tumor suppressor genes that may have been hypermethylated in a patient with cancer.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Mammalian embryos experience two major epigenetic reprogramming periods in development.  These sensitive periods of major epigenetic reprogramming occur during gametogenesis (development of cells that become egg or sperm), and after fertilization "preimplantation reprogramming" before the fertilized egg is implanted.  During preimplantation period, imprinted genes and repeats remain stabilized but maternal and paternal genome become cleared, the paternal rather quickly after fertilization, and maternal more slower dependent on cell division.  In the gametogenesis  phase, maternal, paternal, and imprinted genes of the gametes are cleared and reprogrammed, repeats remaining relatively stable.  If DNA methylation is alterred with a drug in an elderly patient or much older patient who is past the reproductive phase of their life, these sensitive periods are past and would not have an impact to reprogramming.   However, if a drug that alters DNA methylation is given during these sensitive periods, it could have deliterious affects.   If given to a pregnant mother with a newly developing fetus during the phase prior to implantation, it would affect the methylation marks set down in reprogramming in the developing fetus.  As well, the drug could have a significant affect to future generations by affecting the methylation of the gametes in a growing fetus if taking by a pregnant mother, as well as if taken by a patient anytime anytime during germ cell development. </p></div>
