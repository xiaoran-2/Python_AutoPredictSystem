    <h1>Submission 1049 from Anon (session_user_id: 75202e9673db96b1c64784714d9e31a7587cd558)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a drug used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It works by demethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. During replication, it gets incorporated into DNA. When DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand to which DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.   As a result, normal function of tumor suppressor genes is restored.   Thus the control over cell growth is achieved.</p>
<p> Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression. The promoter CpG islands are generally kept free of methylation. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated. This hypermethylation leads to the silencing of the underlying genes including the tumor supressor genes which stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. This leads to the growth of cancer cells. Sometimes, due to chromosome instability, hypomethylation can occur at promoter CpG islands leading to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>The intergenic and repetitive elements in a normal cell are methylated. Normally, DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivativation or formation of heterochromatin. However, in cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated leading to genomic instability. There occurs illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles). Hypomethylation due to deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissues has increased genomic instability. Besides, mutation in DNMT3B  results in ICF syndrome where genomic instability is a characteristic feature.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth, restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. </p>
<p>This is how DNA methylation is altered in Cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In mammals (mice, humans, pigs), only the allele for insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) inherited from one's father is active; that inherited from the mother is not — a phenomenon called imprinting. The mother's allele has an insulator, CTCF 4 bind, between the IGF2 promoter and enhancer. So does the father's allele, but in his case, the insulator has been methylated. CTCF can no longer bind to the insulator, and so the enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promoter.</span></p>
<p>However, with loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, maternal allele, has expression of Igf2. So there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types. It's often seen in preneoplastic tissues. Loss of imprinting at ICR's are the early events in tumoregenesis.</p>
<p><span><br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs act as an demethylating agents and they slow down the tumor growth in cancerous cells. <span> Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. <span>It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>There are periods during postnatal development in which the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Experiences during sensitive periods of development can program genes through DNA methylation. To date, such epigenetic alterations have been identified for several genes known to play prominent roles in cognition and psychiatric disorders. Acquired epigenetic alterations can be inherited and may be potentially reversible. </p>
<p>Hence it is advisable, not to treat patients with these epigenetic drugs during their sensitive periods. Otherwise, many psychiatric disorders can arise.</p>
