    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal (non-cancer) cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated.  CpG islands are commonly found in the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes.  Hypomethylation ensures that the tumor suppressor genes remain turned on.  In cancer cells, CpG islands are <strong>hyper</strong>methylated.  As a result, the promoters of the cells’ tumor-suppressor genes are turned off.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands constitutes one of the “hits” in Knudson’s two-hit model of cancer; when combined with a promoter-activating mechanism for cancer, the inactivation of the tumor-suppressor gene enables uncontrolled cancer cell growth.</p>
<p>In normal cells, in the intergenic regions (including introns) and repetitive elements of the genome, DNA is globally hypermethylated, resulting in genomic stability.  Repetitive elements cause genetic identity between large segments of non-homologous chromosomes.  But hypermethylation causes the chromatin in these repetitive elements to be densely packaged into heterchromatin, and as a result it is not free to form illegitimate recombinations with repetitive elements in non-homologous chromosomes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, DNA is globally hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  As a result, repetitive elements of a given chromosome in a cancer cell are free to form illegitimate recombinations with repetitive elements of non-homologous chromosomes.  Also, because they are not bound into heterchromatin, repetitive elements in cancer cells are free to jump around the genome and insert themselves into genes, disrupting their protein-coding sequences.  Finally, when repetitive elements are hypomethylated, their own promotors can activate surrounding genes and change their functions, becoming the cryptic promoters of those genes.  The overall result of DNA hypomethylation in cancer cells is genomic instability resulting from 1) reciprocal translocations caused by the illegitimate recombinations; 2) insertions or deletions caused by the jumping of repetitive elements; 3) transcriptional aberrations in surrounding regions caused by cryptic promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many growth-promoting genes are normally imprinted so that they are expressed by only one allele.  For example, in the Igf2/H19 gene cluster, Igf2 is expressed only paternally because the imprint control region (ICR) of only the paternal allele is methylated.  Methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele causes enhancers that reside downstream from the gene cluster to act preferentially on Igf2, allowing it to be expressed.  In the maternal allele, the ICR of the gene cluster is unmethylated.  The lack of methylation causes an insulator protein, CTCF, to bind Igf2, and allows a long noncoding RNA, H19, to be expressed in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting can cause gene overexpression and ultimately cancer.  When imprinting in the Igf2/H19 gene cluster is disrupted, CTCF cannot bind and insulate Igf2 in the maternal allele, and the maternal allele inappropriately produces Igf2.  Igf2 is an growth promoting gene, and its expression by both the maternal and paternal alleles causes uncontrolled growth, including a childhood kidney tumor called Wilm’s tumor.  Loss of Igf2 imprinting causes also causes Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, characterized by excessive fetal and post-natal growth and macroglossia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase  Normally, DNA methyltransferase binds methyl groups to DNA, silencing bound DNA by compacting it into heterchromatin and rendering it unavailable for translation into RNA and eventually transcription into protein.   Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a disorder of the hematopoietic cells that is characterized by hypermethylation.  In order to work, Decitabine must be used on cells that are dividing so it can demethylate the newly created daughter cells.  Cancer cells are dividing rapidly, so Decitabine works particularly well on them.  By freeing DNA for transcription, Decitabine enables healthy blood cells to develop and grow.  Decitabine is capable of erasing DNA methylation permanently.  Since most people with myelodysplastic syndrome are elderly, risk to developing embryos and primordial germ cells generally is not a factor and  widespread DNA demethylation of the genome by Decitabine is not considered a problem.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so they are passed to daughter cells during mitosis. But epigenetic drugs are capable of permanently erasing epigenetic marks and thus permanently turning off oncogenes or turning on tumor suppressor genes, because they work during periods of DNA replication. </p>
<p>In humans, there are two "sensitive periods" of development -- waves of epigenetic reprogramming, during which epigenetic marks like DNA methylation are erased and subsequently reset.  These are during pre-implementation development of the patient's embryo and then during mid-gestation, when primordial germ cells develop. The latter eventually become the embryo's germ cells and eventually the offspring's gametes. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods (both during pregnancy) would have potentially catastrophic results for the developing embryo or its primordial germ cells, because they would perpetuate the erasure of and prevent the resetting of epigenetic marks on cells that are totipotent, which have not yet diversified.  Such treatments would be deleterious to the potential offspring and subsequent generations because they would preclude normal embryonic and primordial germ cell development.  So, the drugs are contraindicated in anyone who may be, is, or plans to be pregnant.</p></div>
