    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation (are hypomethylated). However, when the methylation occurs, it is associated with gene silencing. The CpG islands are bound by methylated CpG binding proteins that can repress the transcription or recruit other factors that  condensate the chromatin and form heterochromatin. In cancer cells, tumour suppressor genes are silenced due to the hypermethylation of CpG islands that doesn't normally occur in normal heathy cells. The hypermethylation is mitoticaly heritable, it increases over time and it gives these cells the advantage over others because they divide more rapidly and they die less than the others. The DNA methylation profiles are unique to every tumour subtype. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated and heterochromatinized to maintain genomic stability in normal cells. In cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated and the chromatin isn't as densely packaged (it is euchromatin) so that the illegitimate recombination can occur. The hypomethylation of these repetitive elements also causes their transposition to other regions in DNA where they can disrupt codding region of the gene or they can activate its promotor. All this leads to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, i.e. the imprint control region ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. This methylation blocks binding of CTCF insulator protein and enables enhancers to act on Igf2 and promote its expression. On maternal allele, the ICR isn't methylated so that CTCF can bind to ICR and so insulate the enhancers from Igf2.  Igf2  therefore isn't expressed from maternal allele. In Willm's tumour, both ICR on maternal and paternal alleles are methylated and this blocks the binding of CTCF to ICR on maternal allele as well as on paternal allele. The enhancers can therefore act on Igf2 in both cases and so doubled the dose of this oncogene. The overexpression of Igf2 due to hypermethylation of ICR is associated with childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that targets enzymatic epigenetic regulators, in this case DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and it causes demethylation of DNA. It is FDA approved for curing myelodysplastic syndrome. It is nucleoside analog that incorporates into DNA where it irreversibly binds DNMTs. It is division dependent and because cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, they will be more affected by this drug. The good results obtained when curing patients with myelodysplastic syndrom might be caused by the fact that this type of cancer is associated with hypermethylated CpG islands that are thanks to this drug demethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Thanks to the DNMT1, the methylation marks are copied from maternal strand to the daughter strand. However,there exist sensitive periods during the development - early development and premordial germ cells development, when the methylation marks are errased and than reestablished. After fertilisation the methylation marks of paternal genome are quickly and actively cleared and the methylation marks of maternal genome are cleared more slowly and this process is dependent on the cell division.  After implantation the epigenetic marks are reestablished in lineage specific manner that are than maintained. Altering methylation during early development can affect cell fate and also regulate the methylation pattern of genes of somatic cells. Imprinted genes resist reprogramming during early development and undergo reprogramming in premordial germ cell development.  During this sensitive period, altering DNA methylation can affect the monoallelic (parent-of origin) expression of imprinted genes that are often related to the growth. Such as in Wilm's syndrom where hypermethylation of ICR leads to the double dose of Igf2 oncogene.</p></div>
