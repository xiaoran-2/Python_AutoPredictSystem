    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the main functions of DNA methylation at CpG islands located around gene promoter regions is suppression of their expression. Genes, which are essential for cell function (housekeeping genes) are kept unmethylated, wheras the inactive genes are usually silenced by CpG methylation. In contrast, the methylation of CpG islands in cancer cells is more widespread. As the time progresses, more and more CGI of promoter regions get hypermethylated.  As a result tumor suppression genes get silenced, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. At the same time, most intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. In normal, healthy cells those regions are kept methylated, which in turn helps with maintaining genomic integrity by preventing transposition (either by silencing repeats or by and mutating meC to T), insertions or deletions (for example by blocking splice sites). In cancer cells we can observe progressive genome-wide hypomethylation. As the time passes the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become unmethylated, leading to genomic instability. We can then observe cases of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats with transposition, activation of criptic promoters which can disrupt neighbouring genes and lead to transcription aberrations. The last issue is connected with hypomethylation of poor CpG promoters, which can result in activation of genes being under their control, including some known oncogenes like R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are multiple factors that can contribute to cancer. One of them is connected with disruption of imprinting, which can be easily observed in H19/Igf2 cluster ICR (imprint control region) hypermethylation in Wilm's tumor. H19/Igf2 cluster methylation pattern differs depending on the allele. Maternal allele's ICR is unmethylated, enabling binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which in turn insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Enhancers act on H19 instead, enhancing its expression. On the other hand paternal allele's ICR is heavily methylated, preventing binding of CTCF protein. In this case enhancers can access and activate Igf2. Due to DNA methylation spreading over from ICR to H19 promoter, the gene becomes silenced on the paternal allele. In case of Wilm's tumor maternal allele's ICR becomes hypermethylated which leads to situation similiar as with paternal allele: methylated ICR prevents CTCF from binding, enabling enhancers to act on Igf2 promoter. In this case maternal allele's H19 also becomes silenced due to DNA methylation spreading to gene promoter region. As a result the cell overexpresses growth promoting Igf2 (double the "dose" of normal, healthy cell), which is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the few drugs that affect epigenetic processes is Decitabine, belonging to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class. As a nucleoside analogue it is incorporated into DNA strand, where during the replication it irreversibly binds DNMT. As a result the methylation is not passed onto daughter DNA strands, which in turn leads to DNA demethylation including CpG islands demethylation. It is known that myelodisplastic syndromes are partially caused by CpG islands hypermethylation, thus demethylation caused by using Decitabine activates tumor suppression genes, killing the malignant cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation do not differentiate between normal, healthy cells and cancer cells. In case of, for example, Decitabine the DNA demethylation effect will reach all the cells in the organism and it can remove important epigenetic marks from the genome, impacting further development of the person after the malignant cells were eliminated. This is the reason, why we need to pay attention to certain sensitive periods during body development - periods of epigenetic reprogramming, during which usage of epigenetic drugs could have disastrous effect on the epigenome and thus on the whole organism. There are two sensitive periods: during germ cell development and early embryonic development. In both cases using epigenetic drugs could alter the epigenetic reprogramming causing irreperable damage to the young organism leading to further illnesses, cancer or even premature death.</p>
