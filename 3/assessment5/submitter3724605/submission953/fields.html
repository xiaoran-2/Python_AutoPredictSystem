    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state, which means they are usually unmethylated, this will allow control of gene expression. Methylation of this region is usually associated with silencing of gene expression adjacent to the CpG islands.</p>
<p>The CpG islands tend to be hypermethylation in cancer. This causes, on one hand, genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.</p>
<p>In general, methylation of the CpG islands control/promoter regions results in silencing of the genes they promote their expression. When the gene is inactive or silenced due to addition of methy groups on the control region, the function of the gene will lost as well. The loss of important function of this gene is associated with disease manifestations. For instance, methylation of the CpG islands around the gene that control the production of insulin will result in loss of adequate amount of insulin for glucose control, consequently resulting in diabetes.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This is to ensure genomic stability and silencing of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. In other words DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.</p>
<p>In cancer, the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genomic-wide lack of methylation. This causes genomic instability including high frequency of gene deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations between adjacent genes. These aberrations are normally associated with different forms of cancers. Also alterations of silencing of repeats can induce tumor growth or obstruct important gene functions necessary for inhibition of tumor growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> On the paternal allele, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers to access Igf2, making Igf2 to be expressed. </p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors (cohesins and p68/SRA) to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking, which prevent Igf2 from being accessed by the enhancers. This consequently prevents expression of Igf2. Alternatively, the shared enhancers then locate the H19 promoter side of the insulator.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is associated with loss of monallelic gene expression, resulting in either expression or silencing of both inherited parental alleles. The paternal allele is normally methylated at the ICR to allow enhancers access to the Igf2. In Wilms tumor on the other hand, additional hypermthylation of the maternal allele will result in inheritance of two methylated alleles, enabling enhancers’ access to Igf2 on both alleles, which results to its overexpression, thereby causing uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>Alteration of DNA methylation on the ICP (either hypo- or hyper methylation), can result to loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Depending on the gene in question this can result in diseas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine act by demethylating especially on the CpG islands that control gene expression. Since methylation of the promoter region in cancer is associated with silencing of gene expression, demrthylating of these regions will result in gene expression and restorations of normal gene functions. If this is associated with tumor suppressor genes, restorations of function will involve suppression of tumor growth.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation of the CpG islands around tumor suppressor genes is known to be associated with silencing of those genes thereby causing cancer. Decitabine simply demethylate that region thereby activating normal gene expression and activity. Unmethylating removes the silencing effects of methylation thereby restoring the normal function of those genes in suppressing tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. So if DNA demthylating agents are given to cancer patients, the hypomethylated state formed by these drugs are mitotically inherited during cell division. The set of daughter cells will inherit the hypomethylated states and then transfer the unmethylated genes to their daughters and so on. This explains why altering the DNA methylation will have enduring effects that last for continue generations of cell divisions.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming, which coincides with removal of old and lying down of new epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>They include basically the early embryonic development and PGC development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods have the capacity of altering the epigenetic reprogramming during those periods and consequently alter the epigenetic marks inherited from the parents. A word of caution should be taken to note this sensitive periods to avoid altering the epigenetic mechinery by the drugs.</p></div>
