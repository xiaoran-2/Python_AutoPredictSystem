    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) normally are unmethylated as they are protected from methylation and often occur at promotor regions. But if they are methylated, this is associated with gene silencing, because of their position in the genome.</p>
<p>In cancer there are CGI hypermethylations of specific loci, as well as the CGI shores and whole sets of CGIs, commonly in tumor suppresso<span style="color:#000000;">r genes. </span><span style="color:#000000;">This hypermethylation can be caused by DNMT upregulation, </span><span style="color:#000000;">overexpression or a gain of funktion mutiation.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Which CGIs are methylated depends on the type of cancer and enabe the identification of CGI methylated phenotypes (CHIPS) correlating to cancer caracteristics and in some cases allowing characterization of tumors.</p>
<p><sup>me</sup>CpGs in an CGI cause a repressive chromatin structure because of the binding of MeCPs and the recruitment of condensing factors, which both prohibit the binding of transcriptional factors to the promotor, effectively silencing the affected genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally are methylated, as to prevent unwanted recombination between or translocation of repetitive elements (eg. Transposons, LTRs, LINEs &amp; SINEs), as well as the activation of of cryptic promotors. This would cause deltetions, insertions, reciprocial translocations and the disruption of gene expression, which results in a general instability of the genome, as observed in cancer, where intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, because of a mutation, deletion or other cause for loss of function of the DNMT.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#000000;">Normally imprinted genes should only be expressed by either the maternal or the paternal allele. The hyper- or hypomethylation of imprint control ICRs in cancer causes a loss of imprinting and therefor the expression in both alleles or none, causing either over or under expression of genes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In case of the Igf2/H19 cluster the ICR of the paternal allele normally is methylated, as well as the H19 promotor. This causes the downstream enhancers to directly access Igf2, since the CTCF insulator protein con not bind to the methylated ICR.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, as well as the H19 promotor. This allows the CTCF protein to bind to the ICR and insulates the upstream Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, which instead work on H19, which codes for a lncRNA.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">In the case of Wilms tumor there is a hypermethylation of the ICR, meaning the maternal ICR is methylated and expressing Igf2, too. That means there is no growth inhibiton, which in fetal overgrowth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Furthermore there can be hypomethylation of the Igf2/H19 cluster, which would cause the expression of H19 on both loci. That means there is no growth factor present and the fetus doesn't grow at all.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#000000;">Decitabine is likely a “de novo methyl transferase” (DNMT) inhibitor, which generally are 5-azacytidine analogs that, after being incorporated into DNA upon replication, bind irreversibly to DNMTs. This causes a decrease in DNA methylation simply because the DNMTs are bound and can not methylate DNA anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Since in cancer cells tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, the demethylation of these genes can have an anti-neoplastic effect, because the tumor suppressor genes are expressed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Since DNMTi's are replication dependent, cancer cells incorporate them fast because of their high replication rate, but it is unknown if there are long term effects for normal cells after the drug treatment, especially since the complete mechanism of action is still unclear.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has a lasting effect on the genome, because methylation marks are mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>In certain states of development, the epigenetic marks (e.g. DNA methylation) on the genome are erased and rewritten, these are called “sensitive periods”<span style="color:#800000;">.</span></p>
<p>The 2 sensitive states are firstly the primordial germ cell development in the fetus, were the embryonic genome in the future germ cells is demethylated and imprinting marks (methylation at ICR) are removed, so that both can be reestablished after meiosis when the gametes mature, and secondly the preimplantation phase of the fertilized egg, where DNA methylation is again erased (not the imprinting marks though, they are protected by maternal effector proteins covering the methylation marks) and reestablished in a lineage specific fashion (paternally dependent).</p>
<p>Depending on the severity of hypo- or hypermethylation and which of the 2 phases is affected (gametes or fertilized eggs), there is the possibility of imprinting disorders or other methylation dependent disorders, as well as the high possibility of non viability, because the state of methylation is very important for progressing development and if not correctly established in certain places, can make any development entirely impossible.</p></div>
