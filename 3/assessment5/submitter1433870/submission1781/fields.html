    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics modulates gene expression during cell and tissue differentiation. Our organs acquire their functions through mitotically stable epigenetic mechanisms. DNA methylation is one of them: it consists on enzymatically added methyl groups in the C5 position of the cytosine base.</p>
<p>This addition in gene promoters silences the corresponding expression, as it happens in chromosome X dosage compensation. In normal conditions, the abundant CpG islands in these promoters remain unmethylated. But under oncologic disorders, they become highly methylated sites that lead to an awful silencing of genes; if involved in differentiation and cell growth control, they would evolve into cancer masses.</p>
<p>Other DNA sites able to be epigenetically modified are intergenic and repetitive sequences, such as introns and satellite DNA respectively. In normal conditions they provide with a high cytosine methylation profile. However, the analysis of malignant cells shows a chemical loss specifically in these sites: promotion of the activation of proliferation factors, endogenous retroviral factors and oncogenes would pass through generations and cause the beginning of a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Early stage mammalian embryos undergo an epigenetic silencing of alleles based on a parent-of-origin pattern. These alleles are grouped in clusters that enable the growth, development and metabolism of the animal: only monoallelic expression achieves a healthy organism, that from the father promoting cell growth and that from the mother restricting it.</p>
<p>The primitive insulator model and the long non-coding RNA (ncRNA) model equilibrate this imprinted inheritance in the maternally-expressed H19 and paternally-expressed Igf2 locus. It shares a common imprinting control region (ICR), the human version presenting 6 available sites for methylation or CTCF insulator binding and a promoter for a ncRNA. Within the maternal chromosome, these sites are unmethylated, and the CTCF can bind and activate H19 expression, whereas the presence of ncRNA inhibits the cis-linked Igf2. On the contrary, the paternally methylated ICR prevents the CTCF from binding, and the ncRNA from expressing, allowing the production of the cis-linked Igf2.</p>
<p>Under abnormal conditions, the maternal ICR is easily methylated, acquiring a paternal Igf2 expression pattern. An affected cell will show a biallele Igf2 overexpression, developing an uncontrolled high rate of cell growth. This is the inner mechanism observed in Wilm´s tumor, an embryonic abdominal tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an antimetabolite drug that inhibits DNA methyltransferase, leading to an epigenetic hipomethylation of DNA strands. This RNA cytidine analog eliminates the silencing patterns of suppressor genes involved in cell division and growth, allowing specialization and differentiation.</p>
<p>Its use in myelodysplastic syndromes permits the bone marrow to recover control over cell cycle, and to produce a certain quantity of erythocytes, lymphocytes and platelets. It also has a toxic effect on malignant cells.</p></div>
