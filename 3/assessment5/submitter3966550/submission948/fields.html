    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer the DNA methilation in tissues suffers alterations. The global DNA methylation decreases and progresses from a normal tissue, to hyperplasia, neoplasia ending in a metastatic tissue architecture, while the methylation in some of the CpG-islands, the opposite occurs, it increases from normal tissue to metastatic tissue. This hypermethylation in some CpG islands tends to silence the tumor suppressor genes in cancer, and contributes as one of the “hits” of Knudson theories that hypothesizes that a cell has to suffer multiple hits to DNA in order to develop cancer. In addition, this silencing of the tumor suppressor gene, gives an advantage to the tumor cell over the surroundings normal cell, thus reproducing mitotically at a faster rate and not dying as much.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation in CpG extends to its shores, the neighboring regions 2Kb upstream and downstream.</p>
<p>Most of the genome have intergenic region and repetitive elements, which in a normal cell tends to be methylated. On a cancer cell the intergenic region and repetitive elements tends to be hypomethylated. So genome wide, these portions tends to have less methylation, and its consequences will depende on where it is found. The hypomethylation of the intergenic and repeats found in cancer causes genome instability, producing abnormalities in chromosomes recombination. It may cause deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions of chromosomes. These recombination is produced not only due to repetitive elements or DNA identity on the chromosome but also because the chromatin are misaligned due to the hypomethylation, leaving it open to recombination.</p>
<p>Moreover, the repeats may be activated due to the hypomethylation, and this means they can make copy and place themselves randomly or transpose on the genome. The hypomethylation of the repeats can also cause the activation of their promoters having aberration of transcriptional in the surrounding regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Hypermethylation in Cancer  causes loss of expression on imprint control regions. What this means is that genes that should be expressed on their monoallelic parent of origin do not show their imprinted expression on one allele, rather they show expression on both parental alleles or silenced on both parental alleles. For example, on a H19/Igf2 cluster, in a normal cell, the Imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allele, while it´s unmethylated on the maternal allele. When is unmethylated CTCF will bind to the imprinted region that acts as an insulator, which means that the enhancers will act on gene H19 activating its expression but Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated the insulator will not bind, therefore, the enhancers will act on Igf2 activating its expression. The deregulation that is caused on a tumor cell, for example on Wilm´s tumor, shows a loss of imprinting and the cell will have hypermethilation on the ICRs causing expression of Igf2 on both alleles. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, this doubled expression of growth promoters will cause Wilm´s tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs the the group of DNA methyltransferase Inhibitors and is used for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Are Nucleoside analogues, It is incorporated into the DNA in replication and when the methyltransferase comes to bind that nucleotide it copies the methylation to the daughter strands. Which means that dnmt transferase (DNMT1) it is bound irreversibly and will be never released. Since the action of DNMT1 dependes on replication, the cancer cells, which replicates more rapidly, will be more affected. To become tumor effective, DNMTi have to be administered in low doses, causing DNA demethylation. One of the reasons that it is more widely used in AML, it is that depends on CpG island hypermethylation, and this condition has a poor outcome for AML. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Like DNMTi, HDAC inhibitors depend on replication, which copies the methylation to daughter strands, and through cell division, that is, the content is mitotically heritable, the cell of origin will be replicate to daughter and granddaughter cell. There are also sensitive periods in which transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is performed. Sensitive periods are windows in which epigenetics are more susceptible to be influenced by environmental factors. There are two main sensitive periods, the first one is the period from the formation of primordial germ cells to the formation of gametes, and the second period is the period of pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. These periods may affect the epigenetic machinery not only to the second generation (daughter or son), but also to the third generation (grandsons and granddaughter). Therefore, due to these sensitive periods, and the consequences the environment has on the epigenetics, its logically inadvisable to treat patients on these periods because changes may affect on three generations at once.    </p></div>
