    <h1>Submission 1850 from Anon (session_user_id: 7439f210e962bfa0bbff387af2b6d0664acfc260)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNMT (DNA Methylase Transferase) inhibitors that act as DNA-demethylating agents.  DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA, stopping transcription during future replications.  Because cancer cells replicate more frequently than normal cells, they are more affected by DNMT inhibitors than normal cells.  DNMT inhibitors cause cell death and stop cell growth.   By demethylating the DNA, they also improve access for other chemotherapeutic or radiation agents, so they are also utilized in combinatorial drug treatments.  Decitabine and other DNMT inhibitors have been proven effective in the treatment of blood malignancies, likely because such malignancies are dependent upon the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (so demethylating DNA allows for activation of these tumor suppression genes).  While Decitabine is FDA-approved only for Myelodysplastic syndrome/AML, DNMT inhibitors are in trials for other tumor types, including solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation can exert an effect that lasts beyond the period of treatment because of the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation.  Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the succeeding generations of daughter cells will retain the same DNA methylation pattern after each cell division.</p>
<p>A “sensitive period” is a period of development in which epigenetic marks are cleared and re-set.  There are two sensitive periods: (1) primordial germ cell development; and (2) pre-implantation early embryonic development.  Treating patients with epigenetic drugs that inhibit DNA methylation during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it would interfere with the resetting of DNA methylation marks, with serious consequences.    At the early embryonic stage where there are only a few cells in existence, changes in DNA methylation would affect more cells because any change would be incorporated into all of the succeeding cells generated thereafter.  At the stage of primordial germ cell development, the consequences could also carry into the next generation (i.e., the treated patient’s offspring) by disrupting the resetting of epigenetic marks that will exist in the treated patient’s gametes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated, while repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and gene introns are methylated.  CpG islands are associated with tumor suppression genes, so the lack of methylation of the islands allows for the expression of these genes, which act to suppress tumors.  Methylation of the other regions silences the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions.  This silencing maintains genomic integrity by preventing translocation/transposition/illegitimate recombination and, in the case of repetitive elements, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. </p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, there is a "reciprocal swap" of methylation.  CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, and the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are unmethylated.  The methylation of the CpG islands suppresses expression of the tumor suppression genes, removing normal restraints on tumor growth.  Lack of methylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions contributes to genomic instability by allowing for more translocations/transpositions/illegitimate recombinations, and, in the case of repetitive elements, trascriptional errors caused by interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p>CpG island DNA methylation occurs frequently in tumors and provides an effective alternative to genetic mutations given the mitotic heritability of such methylation and the fact that epimutations are rapidly selected (i.e., make the cancer cells more successful vis-a-vis normal cells).  The alteration of DNA methylation is recognized as one of the "hits" or multiple insults described in the Knudson hypothesis that are necessary to result in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells commonly display a loss of imprinting, with the result that they either express or silence both alleles instead of expressing only the parent-of-origin allele.  This is likely because most imprinted genes focus on growth - either promotion or suppression.  Normally, Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal chromosome because the ICR is unmethylated and bound by an insulator element, which causes the enhancers to act on the H19 rather than Igf2.  Igf2 is normally expressed on the paternal chromosome because methylation of the ICR prevents the insulator element from binding, with the result that the enhancers act to express Igf2 instead of H19.  In a cancer situation, the ICR on the maternal chromosome is methylated, so the maternal chromosome expresses Igf2 instead of H19 just like the paternal chromosome.  When this happens, there is a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoter, so there is excessive growth that results in a Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
