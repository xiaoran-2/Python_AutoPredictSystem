    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1 - CpG islands are generally found around the promoter of genes and methalyation of CpG islands is linked to silencing of gene expression. CpG island typically tend to be protected from methylation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2 - The DNA in CpG island is hyper-methylated in cancer. </span>DNA methylation can be considered as an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancel.</span></p>
<p><span>3 - This results in inactivation or silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This along with other factors results in cancer. The stronger the methylation, bigger the likely tumor would be or later the stage of the cancer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 - In contrast to CpG island, intergenic region and repetitive elements are usually methylated. One of the normal functions is DNA methylation in intergeneic regions as well as repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5 - However, in cancer cells it is opposite of the normal and integenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated - meaning that they are not methylated.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6 - This results in genomic instability in various ways.. These can be illegitimate recombination, undesired activation of repeats, additional deletions or insertions, and activations or promoters and </span>disruption of neighboring genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1 - Decitabine belongs to class of epigenetic inhibitors that inhibit DNA methylation called DNMTi (DNA Methltranphrase inibitors). They are also known as hypo-methylating agents which is just a different name for the same thing. </span></p>
<p><span>2 - It stops overmethylation of DNA. This DNA demethylation happens best at certain dosages which has neo-plasty effect which means that it kills cancer skills. </span></p>
<p><span>3 - Decitabine gets incorporated in the DNA during the replication. DNMT1 then gets bound irreversibly to the nucleotide and it can no longer be released. Since its gets incorporated at the time of replication, if cancer cells are dividing at an increased rate, the effect of Decitabine would be more as well.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1 - DNA methylation has enduring effects as it is passed to the subsequent generations of the cells and can change the expression or gene and /or their functions. However, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during the sensitive periods of the development.</span></p>
<p><span>2 - The sensitive period is when environment is able to exert control on epigenetic changes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3 - Pre-implantation to post-implantation (early embryonic period) and Primordial germ cell development to production of eggs/sperm(germ cell development period) are two sensitive periods.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4 - During the sensitive period the patient's cells are going through epigenetic programming. Both maternal and paternal alleles are being demethylated and then markers are put on them. Therefore, treatment would not have any effect and in fact might have undesired effect.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The loss of imprinting can contribute to cancer by </span><span><span>either being expressed in both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. Lots of genes imprinted are involved in growth - either growth promoting or growth suppressing.</span></span></p>
<p><span>1 - The imprint control region on paternal allele is methylated and it results is growth promotion of Igf2 because enhancers can act on it instead of H19.</span></p>
<p><span>2 - The imprint control region on paternal allele is not methylated and it results is growth promotion of H19 instead of igf2 as enhancers only act on H19 .</span></p>
<p><span>3 - The ICR is disrupted in Wilm's tumor when ICR becomes methylated in Wilm's Tumor resulting in both maternal and paternal alleles becoming methylated. This results in double dose of igf2.</span></p>
<p><span>4 - The double dose of enhancers to Igf2 results in hyper growth causing cancer. </span></p></div>
