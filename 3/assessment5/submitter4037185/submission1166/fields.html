    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, DNA methylation decreases generally across the genome, but increases at CpG islands (CGIs).<br />If Imprint Control Regions are either hyper- or hypomethylated, this can affect cell growth promotion or suppression, both of which are linked to cancer.  If growth is encouraged or growth suppressors are silenced, tumours can expand.<br />DNA methylation of CpG islands (CGIs) are often found near the promoters of genes, where transcription begins.  This means they can act to silence gene expression.  This is necessary for example in X inactivation, and in selecting which genes are expressed in offspring.<br /><br />Similar to the result of normal ageing, CGIs become hypermethylated in cancer.<br />Hyper-methylation of CGIs and their adjacent  shores up to 2kb away means that normal gene promoters will not be expressed.<br /><br />Methylation of CpG dinucleotides at intergenic regions helps maintain the stability of the genome by preventing deletions, swapping and additions of genes.  Methylation of repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity, by stopping repeats from jumping to different areas of the genome, where they could cause problems.  Methylation of repeats can also compact the chromatin, avoiding illegitimate recombination.<br />eg. hyper-methylation at CpG islands (CGIs) and at the adjacent CGI shores up to 2kb further along the genome means that promoters will not be expressed.<br /><br />DNA demethylation at intergenic regions (hypomethylation) occurs mainly at repeats, and causes genomic instability.  It is commonly observed in cancer.  <br /><br />Hypomethylation means that the chromatin is more open (euchromatin), and therefore succeptible to disruption by moving repeats, or by promoters becoming activated when they would normally be inactive.<br /><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Both increases and decreases in methylation of Imprint Control Regions can stop growth restricting genes being expressed.  These genes normally protect against cancer.  At the same time, growth promoting genes can be overexpressed.  The protection is removed just when it is needed most.<br />Igf2 is growth promoting.  With extra methylation on the maternal allele of the chromasome, Igf2 is expressed from the maternal and paternal side when there should be expression from the allele of just one parent, so there is too much growth, associated with Wilm's tumour in the kidneys.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent.  It might be used to treat cancer by making changes to the epigenome which allow more effective chemotherapy treatments.  The epigenetic changes it introduces are mitotically heritable, so that as the cancer cells reproduce, they pass on the changes to their daughter cells.  This makes tumours more and more susceptible to chemotherapeutic drugs.  Because it demethylates the CpG islands, tumour suppressor genes can be re-activated.<br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns which have been altered by drug treatment may be passed on to daughter cells during mytosis by the de novo methyltransferases (ref lecture 5, week 1).  This means that their effects could last beyond the period when the drug is present, because the changes they introduce are mitotically heritable.<br />A sensitive period is a time when there is active methylation and demethylation.  The two main sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell development, when the epigenetic marks need to be cleared to allow cells in the new organism to express different genes in different places, and around the time of implantation, from fertilised egg to epiblast.  This means that treatment during pregnancy should be avoided.  Epigenetic changes introducued by the drugs could inadvertently be passed on to future generations through the gametes.</p></div>
