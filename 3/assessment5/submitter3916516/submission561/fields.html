    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG islands are found at the promoters of many genes. Methylation of the Cytosine base on the C-G links on these islands reduces the expression of the genes associated with them.</li>
<li>CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated in cancer cells and methylation increases as the cancer progresses. The “shores”, or surrounding areas, of the CpG islands are also hypermethylated.</li>
<li>Tumor suppressor genes are usually hypomethylated because of their role in maintaining a healthy cell. The methylation of their CpG islands silences these genes, causing the cancer cells to multiply rapidly because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.</li>
<li>Introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements are redundant and largely useless parts of the genome. Methylation of these vestigial parts of the genome prevents them from being expressed.</li>
<li>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are demethylated.</li>
<li>The demethylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes these parts to be expressed. This can result in unwanted or possibly harmful genes being expressed, or overdosage in the case of repetitive elements, both of which are harmful to the cell and the organism and contributes to disease.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The imprint control region is usually methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Only the Igf2 transcribed from the paternal allele would be expressed. This is because the H19 is methylated, so the enhancers can act on Igf2 instead of H19, whereas in the maternal allele the enhancers would act on H19 because it is unmethylated.</li>
<li>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also methylated, resulting in both maternal and paternal copies of Igf2 being expressed. The dosage of Igf2 is doubled, while H19 is not expressed, and this change of dosage causes Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney cancer.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It would demethylate tumor suppressor genes and therefore encourage expression.</li>
<li>Decitabine and DNA-demethylators have been shown to help cancer patients when used with histone-deacetylase inhibitors. They have been used to treat both single-cell cancers such as leukemia and solid tumors such as those found in lung cancer. Either the tumors decreased, or the patients had a better reaction to subsequent treatments.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and can also be passed down up to 2 more generations.</li>
<li>During a sensitive period, altered environments or changes to the body can have effects on epigenetic control.</li>
<li>The sensitive periods are the blastocyst stage and the primordial germ cell stage. The DNA is largely demethylated because the epigenome is undergoing reprogramming.</li>
<li>During sensitive periods, the epigenome is easily altered by outside influences, be it medicine, environmental changes, or development. Any treatment could easily permanently alter the epigenome, and the patient could feel negative effects that persist after they are healthy again.</li>
