    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   In a normal cell DNA methylation at CpG islands stops the expresion of the next gene when that gene is not needed. (DNA CpG island methalation can be used to stop a gene that that stops other genes, there by cousint gene activation.)</p>
<p>   In a cancerous cell almost all CpG Islands are methylated whether the gene is needed or not.</p>
<p>   The blocking of CpG Island methalation can block tumor represive genes and/or inderectly activate growth genes</p>
<p>   In a normal cell DNA methylation in intergenic regions helps stabalise the DNA and the methelation helps stop repetitive elements from being exprest</p>
<p>   In a cancerous cell there is almost no DNA methylation in intergenic regions or on repetitive elements.</p>
<p>   The lack of DNA methylation destabilizes the chromosomes causing deletions, insertions, amplifications, and point mutations. The lack of methylation on repetitive elements lets them be read more, often leading to disrution of other genes were the repetitive elements are repeated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   On the paternal allele the CpG island at the begining of the H19 gene is methalated, alowing the Igf2 gene to be active.</p>
<p>   On the maternal allele the CpG island at the begining of the H19 gene is unmethalated; the H19 gene uses enhancers to get a protine the stops the Igf2 gene from being transcribed.</p>
<p>   In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele gets methalated causing an over-expresion of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>   The Igf2 gene is a growth promoting gene and over-expretion will cause tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Decitabine is a <span>DNA demethylating agent.</span></p>
<p><span>   Decitabine gets rid of <span>DNA methylation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>   Decitabine can activate tumor represive genes.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Some parts of the epigenome are mitotically heritable and any changes to those parts will be past from cell through division.</p>
<p>   A sensitive period is a time when an organisams genome is undergoing an epegenetic change making the epegenetics vunerable to outside influence.</p>
<p>   The sensitive period of development are the blastocyst stage and during germ cell maturation.</p>
<p>   Treating patients during a sensitive period would almost surely cause epigenetic disruption.</p></div>
