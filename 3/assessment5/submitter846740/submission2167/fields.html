    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is althered in cancer because the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands for transcriptional silencing of gene expression. <span> H<span>ypermethylation (too much DNA methylation) on CpG island will <span>promote transcriptional silencing of tumour <span>suppressor gene which protect the cell growth abnormally. Both of the disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contribetes to cancer tumour grow. Normally it is locus specific DNA hypermethylation on </span></span></span></span>CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes, to silence tumour suppressor genes lead to loss control of cell cycle and become tumour cell.the mechanism of gene expression errors to cancer is a complex mechanism. According Knudson hypothesis, cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA, including abnormal DNA methylation on CpG island of important genes.</p>
<p>Normal function of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome stabillty. Hypomethylation, less DNA methylation on specific parts of genome (eg. intergenic regions, repetitive elements and exon), on repeats and intergenic intervals will lead to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, which potatially cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Abnormal tranposable elements in genome can cause translocation, deletion or insertion which will cause further gene expression errors and lead to cancer occur.</p>
<p><span>In conclusion, Disruption of DNA methylation contribute to cancer disease mainly by two ways. It can be driven by </span>tumour suppressor hypermethylation in CpG island, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis or chromosomal instability which cause by  hypomethylation in intergenic regions, repetitive elements, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dectibine is a type <span>DNA-demethylating agents. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is demethylation of DNA. <span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting </span><span>DNA methyltransferase</span>. The anti-tumour effect of <span>Decitabine can treat the cancer which tumour suppressor hypermethylation in CpG island. The abnormal DNA methylation on CpG island of important surpressor genes can be decrease and the normal expression of surpressor gene can be reactived.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Dr. Stephen Baylin's research about a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. The drugs can alter DNA methylation beyond the period of drug treatment and have <span>enduring effect</span> is because it invloving with epigenome reprograming. Epigenome reprograming treatment which althering DNA methylation can have enduring effect because it is regulate and repair from the source of cancers, gene expression which is more lasting .Y</span>ounger patients or pregnant woman may have effects on germ cells development or primordial germ cell development need to considere to avoid treating with such drugs because they are under epigenome sensitive period. Sensitive period is the period which epigenetic reprogramming in early development occur. It is rapid and active demethylation in paternal genome and passive demethylation in maternal genome. The <span>epigenetic drugs may cause unpredictable result in altering epigenetic reprogramming of germ cells development and it may have </span>transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes if any error or epigenetic disorders occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, in the example of H19/lgf2 cluster is due to enhancer blocking.</span></p>
<p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele determines Igf2 expression status of enhance Igf2 expression but the main source of disruption in IGF2 imprinting in Wilms tumors involved a  in the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited IGF2 and H19 alleles. Maternal transmission cause from carrier mother to affected offspring. The mechanism of maternal transmission is DNA methylation at imprint control regions blocks binding of CTCF binding. The CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The blocking of CTCF binding is important for a normal gene regulation but the methylation loss in maternal gene cause the disorders.</p>
<p>The distupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contributes to disease by loss of Cdkn1c tumour suppressor gene and lead to grow suppressing and upregulation of Igf2 oncogene which promote growth.</p></div>
