    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the important epigenetic features. In particular, DNA methylation at CpG islands regulates gene expression: CpG islands are often associated with gene promotors, and CpG island methylation is equivalent to gene silencing. However, in cancer, CpG island methylation level increases with decease development, leading to inactivation of normally activated genes, for example, tumour suppressor genes. Specific tumour suppressor genes inactivated in this way for concrete cancer types have been identified. Methylation profile in cancer changes not only at CpG islands themselves, but at 2 kB CpG island shores. Hypermethylation at CpG island shores correlates as well with gene expression. Intergenic regions and repeats are usually methylated in normal DNA. The key function of methylation in this case is maintenance of genomic stability. In cancer, methylation level of mentioned regions decreases and may cause recombination between chromosomes and, therefore, abnormal karyotype of affected cells. In turn, genomic instability cause activation of repeats and transposons and, generally, incorrect gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes specify by distinct expression of paternal and maternal allele. It is realized by different methylation profile of the alleles. Imprints play significant role in cell growth regulation. One of the studied examples of imprints if H19/Igf2 cluster. In that case, imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated, as well as part of paternal H19 promotor, and enhancers are able to activate paternal Igf2 gene. On the other hand, maternal allele ICR is unmethylated. CTCF complex (it can be attached only to unmethylated ICR) binds to maternal allele, preventing activation of Igf2 by enhancers. In the case of maternal allele, enhancers activate H19 gen instead. One can observe ICR methylation alterations in cancer. In particular, in the case of Wilm’s tumour both paternal and maternal ICRs of H19/Igf2 cluster are methylated. Consequently, both alleles demonstrate “paternal” type of gene expression: overexpression of Igf2 combined with loss of expression of H19. Balance of these genes expression in healthy cell provide normal cell development. In cancer, balance fails, leading to the tumour tissue growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylation agent. As soon as DNA methylation alterations are the key point in cancer development, regulation of DNA methylation “from outside” using special agents is important. Decitabine is one of the attractive candidates: it inhibits DNA methyltranferase. With decitabine, one can remove excessive methylation marks once and normal epigenetic state will maintain, as epigenetic marks is mitotically heritable. Tumour development can be slowed or stopped in this manner.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Important feature of most epigenetic marks is that they are mitotically heritable. So, once appeared, mark maintains in the progeny, passing from parent cell to the daughter one. Using drugs, altering epigenetic state of the DNA, one can fix this epimutation: for instance, methylation marks, once removed, will never come back. During organism development there are periods when cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming: wide (but not complete) removal of epigenetic marks and deposition of new ones. These periods are called sensitive periods. One sensitive period takes place during development from fertilized egg to epiblast, the second one happens during development of primordial germ cells. In these periods we do not keep in view to maintain any alteration from outside (using drugs): reprogramming of epigenetic state will alter epigenome anyway, so changes introduced by us can not be fixed unlike any other period of organism development.</p></div>
