    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a vital process involved in epigenetic gene regulation within cells. Normally the cpg islands within a cell remain unmethylated to enable successful transcription of those genes related to them. To turn a gene 'off' the cpg island preceding the gene is methylated which inhibits transcription of that gene. In general, when a cell is cancerous is has a hypermethylation of many different cpg islands effectively turning those genes 'off''. This is especially true for genes with tumour suppressing roles and, as such, hypermethylation at these sites can contribute significantly to the abnormal proliferation of cells which can lead to cancer. </p>
<p>Not all areas in the DNA of a cell are normally hypomethylated though. Whilst in a normally functioning cell the cpg islands are generally hypomethylated, the intergenic regions, repetative elements and even introns are, on a whole, mostly hypermethylated. The hypermethylation of repeats is especially important as it maintains genomic stability. It does this by minimising the risk of illegitimate recombination between chromosomes and events such as insertions or deletions. In a cancerous cell, these intergenic regions and the repeats are hypermethylated leading to these deleterious recombination events. The hypomethylation of repeats also 'activates' them allowing the repeat to be transposed to different areas in the DNA which can lead to the abberant transciption of genes if they transpose within a gene or even the activation of certain genes if they transpose near a cryptic promotor of that gene. This contributes to the prevalence of diseased cells as it can activate oncogenes allowing the abnormal proliferation of those cells, it can activate miRNA's leading the the suppression of tumour suppressing genes and by generally causing chromosomal instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug classed as a <span class="st">DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMi), </span>available for the treatment of cancer, particularly the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine works by actively blocking DNA methyl transferases which would normally pass on the methylation state of methylated DNA or histones in order to regulate certain gene's expression resulting in hypomethylation. It does this as it is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into the DNA of a cell and when a DNMT comes to bind it in order to pass on the methylation state of that cell to the daughter cell it is bound irreversibly by the drug. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by removing methylation from certain tumour-suppressing genes that have ceased to function correctly due to hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation state is mitotically inheritable, any alterations to the epigenetic state in relation to DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as the methylation state is passed on to the daughter cells. Drugs that induce these changes in methylation state can therefore have a lasting effect beyond the intitial period of drug treatment. This is good news for patients with tumours however there are periods in which these drugs may not be beneficial. There are certain times when the cells are susceptible to changes in their epigenetic regulation due to changes in the environment known as sensitive periods. There are two main periods of sensitivity both when the cells are undergoing active epigenetic reprogramming. The first is the period between primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature sperm and egg cells. The second is the period between pre-implantation and early post-implantation. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable as changes in these periods are effectively 'locked in' during somatic maintenance of epigenetic control and can also be trans-generationally inherited.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, there is an imprint control region (ICR) downstream of the Igf2 gene and upstream of the H19 gene. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which doesn't allow the transcriptional repressor CTCF to bind to the ICR, which in turn allows downstream enhancers to effectively promote the expression of the Igf2 gene. In the maternal allele, the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind there which inhibits the enhancers from expressing Igf2 and rather makes them promote the expression of H19. In Wilm's tumour however, there is a hypermethylation of this cluster resulting in the ICR of both the paternal and maternal alleles being methylated. This means that both alleles are expressing the Igf2 gene and neither are expressing H19 resulting in a double dose of Igf2 when compared to a normal patient. This disruption of imprinting at this cluster causes Wilm's tumour as the Igf2 gene is a growth promoting gene and thus a two-fold increase in its expression leads to abnormal tissue growth.</p></div>
