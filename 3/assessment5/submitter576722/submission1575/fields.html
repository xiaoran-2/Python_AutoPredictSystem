    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually, but not always, unmethylated.  DNA methylation at CpG islands can result in silencing of gene expression, via condensing the chromatin or transcription factor binding. </p>
<p>One form of cancer methylates a CpG island that would normally be unmethylated.  This is known as CpG island hypermethylation.  DNA methylation of a CpG island in a tumor suppressor gene will allow the tumor to grow uncontrolled.  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  These epimutations are reversible, unlike (genetic) mutations.</p>
<p>When CpG islands of a set of genes are methylated it is called CIMP:  CpG island methylator phenotype.  This has been identified with colorectal cancer, gliomas, and neuroblastoma.  CIMP may allow identification of the primary tumor, which can provide a better diagnosis of the best therapy.</p>
<p>Recently it has been discovered that sometimes when you have hypermethylation of a CpG island, you also have hypermethylation of neighboring CpG islands, which is called CpG island shores.  This can improve the prediction of gene expression.  </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  This helps maintain genomic integrity.  Methylation at intergenic regions will silence transcription.   Methylation at repetitive elements will prevent transposition and will silence the repeats.</p>
<p>In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated. This is known as hypomethylation.  Without silencing transcription at intergenic regions, genomic instability can result in a variety of ways.  Portions of the chromosome may experience deletions, extra portions of the chromosome may be inserted, and there may be reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes.  Unmethylated repetitive elements will allow the repeats to be active which will result in mutations.  This will allow repeats to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome which could be disruptive to some of the genes or activate neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. The enhancers will act on Igf2 which results in the Igf2 being expressed.</p>
<p>Also in a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele.  In this case the CTCF will bind an insulator element on the ICR.   This results in the enhancers acting on H19 and the Igf2 being silenced.</p>
<p>Thus, in a normal cell ICRs will silence one of the parental alleles, and one Igf2 will be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, both the maternal and paternal allele have methylation on the ICR and the enhancers will act on Igf2 for the maternal and paternal alleles allowing Igf2 expression on both alleles, which gives a double dose of Igf2. </p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with Wilm’s tumor, which is a childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors (DNMTi), also referred to as DNA-demythylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine is effective during DNA replication as it disables the ability to copy methylation to the daughter strand. </p>
<p>Since cancer cells are replicating more than other cells in the body, decitabine will affect them more by silencing the repeats. </p>
<p>Assuring that the CpG islands in the tumor suppressors are not methylated will activate the tumor suppressors and have an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation helps to maintain genomic stability.  Epigentic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.  Once erased, though, they do not return.  This is how DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the time period when epigenetic marks are normally established.  The periods are during pre-implantation early development (before the embyo implants and makes a placenta) and during the primordial germ cell development</p>
<p>The treatments have the potential to affect every cell, so it would not be good to implement the treatment on patients during sensitive periods so as not to disturb normal epigenetic cell development.</p></div>
