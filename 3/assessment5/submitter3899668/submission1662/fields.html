    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation consists is the addition of a methyl group at a cytosine by the novo methyltransferase. Clusters of CpG form CpG islands in order to be protected by methylation and are found 60% of the time at promoter of genes. Methylated CpG islands are bound by MECP1and MECP2 that have a DNA binding domain and can recruit other factors to condense the chromatin. Heterochromatin is unlikely to be expressed since the transcription machinery is not able to access the gene. In the example of the transfactor SP1, the methylated CpG islands prohibit the transfactor from binding and alter the gene expression. In cancer CpG islands can be hypermethylated which leads to the silencing of a gene. This could be dangerous for the cell since the silencing of a tumour suppressor gene for example, will enable the abnormal and uncontrollable proliferation of a cell carrying an unwanted mistake. This particular silencing is more common than genetic mutations and triggers to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions enables the silencing of a cryptic promoter which could avoid transcriptional interference (which happens in cancer when they are hypomethylated). DNA methylation at repetitive elements is a less common mutation which prevents the transposition of a gene to a region with similar repeats. This silencing via DNA methylation can also protect the genome from transposable elements, also a major problem leading present in cancer cells. In both cases, DNA methylation maintains the genome integrity. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated or even unmethylated. This has dramatic effects on the genome as duplications, translocations and deletions become more common due to the possibility of illegitimate recombination of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters. Transposable elements and strong promoters can promote tumour growth and malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, H19 is methylated and therefore silenced. The enhancer will act on Igf2 which will be expressed. In the maternal allele, the H19 gene is unmethylated. The CTCF will bind to the insulator element which allows the enhancers to express H19 but will silence Igf2. Sometimes, the Imprint Control Region (ICRs) will be hypermethylated and both parental alleles will be expressed, demonstrating a loss of imprinting for this genes. This will have Wilm’s tumour as a consequence. In fact, in Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele follows the methylation pattern of the paternal allele. Igf2 will therefore be overexpressed since there is an extra dose of Igf2. Meanwhile, there is a lack of H19. The insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) as its name indicates will promote gene growth and cell division. The cell will therefore change is normal cell cycle and will continuously divide while growing abnormally without restrictions. Uncontrollable cell proliferation which invades normal cells is what leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dectabine is a DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT) inhibitor which is used to treat the acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Dectabine is a cytidine analogue meaning that it has a similar structure to cytidine. As a result the DNMT will mistake Dectabine for cytidine and will try to methylate it instead. Since DNMT is the enzyme that enables DNA methylation, if DNMT is inhibited by Dectabine, the genome will be therefore be less methylated. Hypomethylation leads to the silencing of certain important genes such as tumour silencing genes. But this hypomethylating agent will enable the cell to keep expressing these tumour silencing genes, necessary to control the cell growth. </p></div>
