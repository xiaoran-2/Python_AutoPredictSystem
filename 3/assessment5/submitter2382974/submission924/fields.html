    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a mechanism for changing the base sequence of DNA without altering its coding function. As a heritable, yet reversible, epigenetic change, it has the potential of altering gene expression and has profound developmental and genetic consequences. The methylation reaction itself is mechanistically complex and involves the flipping of the target cytosine out of the intact double helix, so that the transfer of the methyl group from </span><em>S</em><span>-adenosylmethionine can occur in a cleft in the enzyme</span><span>. Cytosine methylation is inherently mutagenic, which presumably has led to the suppression of the CpG methyl acceptor site in eukaryotic organisms, which methylate their genomes. It contributes strongly to the generation of polymorphisms and germ-line mutations, and to transition mutations that inactivate tumor-suppressor genes</span><span>. Despite the increase in the rate of transitions at methylated versus unmethylated cytosines</span><span>, methylation is not only tolerated in several eukaryotes, but is actually required for the embryonic development of mammals</span><span>. The reasons 5-methylcytosine is essential for development remain obscure, but most probably relate to the well documented ability of methylation, particularly the methylation of CpG-rich promoters, to block transcriptional activation. Indeed, there is growing evidence that methylation plays a pivotal role in key developmental processes such as genomic imprinting and stabilization of X-chromosome inactivation. It therefore is not surprising that alterations in this essential epigenetic system might play a role in carcinogenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation of the ICR controls the reciprocal imprinting of IGF2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF. Local changes in histone modifications and CTCF--cohesin binding at the ICR in BWS and SRS together with DNA methylation correlate with the higher order chromatin structure at the locus. In lymphoblastoid cells from control individuals, we found the repressive histone H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 marks associated with the methylated paternal ICR allele and the bivalent H3K4me2/H3K27me3 mark together with H3K9ac and CTCF. In patient-derived cell lines, the mat/pat asymmetric distribution of these epigenetic marks was lost with H3K9me3 and H4K20me3 becoming biallelic in the BWS and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 and H3K9ac together with CTCF-cohesin becoming biallelic in the SRS. We further show that in BWS and SRS cells, there is opposing chromatin looping conformation mediated by CTCF--cohesin binding sites surrounding the locus. In normal cells, lack of CTCF--cohesin binding at the paternal ICR is associated with monoallelic interaction between two CTCF sites flanking the locus. CTCF--cohesin binding at the maternal ICR blocks this interaction by associating with the CTCF site downstream of the enhancers. The two alternative chromatin conformations are differently favoured in BWS and SRS likely predisposing the locus to the activation of IGF2 or H19.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an analog of deoxycytidine and a prodrug that has to be activated by photophosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase</span><span>. Since its antineoplastic action is dependent on its incorporation into DNA, DAC is an S phase specific agent. The incorporation of DAC in place of 5-methylcytosine in DNA results in the inactivation of DNA methyltransferase 1 due to covalent bond formation between the 5-azacytosine ring of DAC and this enzyme. The end result of this process is hypomethylation of DNA. Genes that are silenced by aberrant DNA methylation can be reactivated by treatment with DAC. Both leukemic and tumor cells are very sensitive to the antineoplastic action of low concentrations of DAC. In animal models of leukemia and cancer, DAC shows curative potential</span><span>. The antineoplastic action of DAC is very dose-schedule dependent. The major side effect of DAC is granulocytopenia.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>To introduce, side effects of chemotherapeutics also include increased incidence of cancers secondary to those being treated. Since most chemotherapy drugs are genotoxic, it is quite likely that they cause epigenetic damage. In fact, it has been demonstrated that genotoxic carcinogens, in addition to exerting genotoxic effects, often cause epigenetic alterations. For example, Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal anti-estrogen used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. It is also a potent hepatocarcinogen in rats, with both tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting properties. There is substantial evidence that the hepatic tumors in rats are initiated as a result of formation of tamoxifen-DNA adducts. Recently it was shown that the mechanism of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis also includes an epigenetic component. In rats fed tamoxifen in their diet, global liver DNA hypomethylation increased up to 200%. Protein expressions of maintenance DNA methyltransferase and de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b were decreased. Likewise, trimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 was signiﬁcantly decreased. Tamoxifen has also been shown to induce very rapid, irreversible epigenetic inactivation of estrogenic responses permanent chromatin remodeling and profound changes in microRNA expression. This conﬁrms that tamoxifen can cause permanent epigenetic modiﬁcations in human cells, but the importance of these ﬁndings to the etiology of tamoxifen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis needs to be explored.</p></div>
