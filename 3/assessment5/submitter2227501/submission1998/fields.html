In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In carcinogenesis in all tumoral cells we can see abnormal methylation. The first, we see DNA hypomethylation of all genome of a tumoral cells. Result of genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is: the high probability of a hyper expression of oncogenes, activation of mobile genetic elements – retrotransposones (they can be integrated into the genes regulating a cell cycle, and to cause their inactivation), high probability of chromosomal instability assuming loss of supressor-genes and  oncogenes hyper-amplification or appear of chimeric genes with new onkogen-functions.<br />The second, we see - hypermethylation of CpG-islands in promoter areas of genes, and we see their full inactivation (these genes are participating in apoptosis, angiogenesis, differentiation, DNA repair, metastasis, signal transmission, detoxication and etc). Thus, we haven't structural changes of gene nucleotide sequence, but gene completely loses the activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is inhibitor of enzyme DNA methyltransferase. This drug get incorporated into DNA dividing cells by transformation in deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Being incorporated into DNA, deoxynucleoside triphosphates interact with DNA methyltransferases and they form covalent intermediate products which inhibit DNA methylation in the subsequent stages DNA synthesis.</p>
<p>It is known that methylation of a promoter site of a gene (or a site close to it) inhibits a transcription. DNA demethylation restores a gene expression. Gene activation by DNA methylation inhibitor – Decitabine, can give the way to differentiation-inducing factor - desirable effect in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) therapy and in other malignant growths of blood therapy; also Decitabine can give the way to activation tumor suppressor genes and other genes, whose effect can be extrapolated to many types of tumors.</p></div>
