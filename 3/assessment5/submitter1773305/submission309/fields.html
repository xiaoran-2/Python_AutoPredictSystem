    <h1>Submission 309 from Anon (session_user_id: 00b6186d3fdc731db2a4c04f703c1a31c0598c9a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating, or hypomethylating agent (it does not affect RNA). As a general rule,<strong> less methylated</strong> areas in the epigenome are associated with <strong>increased</strong> microchemical activity. As cancer is also associated with elevated activity (cell division), demethylating agents by definition need to be highly targeted to certain areas, so as not to achieve the opposite effect from that intended.  Appropriate hypomethylating agents are compounds that have the potential to selectively reverse abnormal (increased) DNA methylation and cause re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes, here in particular tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). The compound works through binding to the enzymes catalyzing the methlylation reaction, DNA methlytransferases, for example DNMT1. The drug illustrates the attractive reversibilty potential of epigenetic therapies, and is also classified as an anti-metabolite, disproportionately targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells, leading to their apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/ IGF2 imprinted control region (ICR) is a differentially methylated mono-allelic region (DMR) occuring on the p-segment of chromosome 11. The DMR is methylated on the paternal chromosome and is able to bind a protein which silences the H19 gene, allowing expression of IGF2. On the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF acts as an insulator protein between the two, blocking IGF2 from downstream enhancers, preventing its expression, and allowing H19 to be expressed.</p>
<p>Also on the maternal allele is the WT1 gene (Wilms tumor suppressor), and where the chromosome is disrupted in some way preventing correct function, uncontrolled cell division occurs and childhood kidney tumors (Wilm's tumor) may result. The disease can also be a consequence of Beckwith-Weidemann syndrome, a condition where two copies of the (methylated) paternal allele are present causing overactivity of the IGF-2 gene (oncogenic growth factor) and/or no active copy of CDKN1C (an inhibitor of cell proliferation). Although BW syndrome does not always result in cancer (although there is a much increased likelihood), other growth based abnormalities such as abnormal foetal size, gigantism, large tongue, and expanded glands can lead to a life of disease and discomfort.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, approximately 2-7% of DNA is methylated, and is often grouped into islands of 1-2kbp at C-G dinucleotides. Function is usually inhibitory, particularly when location is adjacent to a gene promoter altering molecular ergonomics and preventing transcription. 'Housekeeping' genes - those required by all cells - are mostly unmethylated, and CpG islands control (suppress) more highly regulated genes which are tissue-specific.</p>
<p>During increased cell division associated with cancer, CpG islands can be disrupted if methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3a are unable to keep pace, leading to a dilution efffect and increased relative genome-wide hypomethylation.  Progressive hypomethylation is found in almost all tumors. But in trying to repair cancer, cell defense mechanisms, often coordinated by the key p53 gene, <strong>increased</strong> methylation may be signaled, recruiting methyl binding domains and compacting nucleosomes toward heterochromatin, reducing cell growth and even instructing apoptosis. Identified gene loci where hypermethylation has been found include RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 and MGMT in colorectal cancer and BRCA1 in breast cancer. Fragile X syndrome, though not cancerous, also involves hypermethylation of CpG islands through additional genetic insertion of CGG trinucleotides.</p>
<p>The majority of the human genome consists of long-term repeat sequences and repetitive elements which do not code for proteins. These are inhibited by spaced methylation, theorized as necessary to keep younger evolutionary transposons from causing aberrant genetic behavior. IAPs as an example are methylated throughout sensitive gametogenesis for this reason. Long considered as junk DNA, these regions were known to contain promoters and enhancers, and removal of epigenetic marks close to such areas has now been linked to various cancers. There are two main mechanisms. Activation of a silenced growth gene such as IGF2 on chromosome 11 (Wilm's tumor), or silencing a tumor suppressor gene eg R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>External direct DNA repair is beyond the scope of today's medicine, but using the body's own molecular regulatory mechanism - epigenetics - holds great promise as epigenetic alterations are as important as genetic mutations in a cell's cancerous transformation. Epigenetic changes, including methylation, are mitotically inherited in daughter cells for the life of the treated subject, and thus will last beyond an initial treatment period. These methylation marks are only normally altered in the cell cycle during two sensitive periods, the pre-implantation period of early somatic cell development between zygote and blastocyst stages, and then in midgestation in primordial germ cell development (non-somatic). Consequently, treating female patients who are pre-pubescent, may be pregnant, or about to become pregnant would risk altering the desired effect of a target drug, as the underlying epigenetic status itself may be subject to change.</p></div>
