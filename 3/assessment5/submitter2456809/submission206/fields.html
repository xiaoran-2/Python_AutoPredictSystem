    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are mainly "Promoter". So the methylations of CpG islands are repression of gene expression. CpG methylations are heritable and stable by DNA methyltransferase 1. It contribute to imprinting,  or cellular differentiation. <br />In cancer, genome wide DNA hypomethylation are shown. In CpG islands hypermethylations are often seen. It means silencing of "tumor suppressor genes". Even CpG shores (within 2Kb neighbouring) are hypermthylated, and could cause cancer gene activation.  Those could be caused by stochastic, by cellular stress, by imprinting abnormalities, but the details are unknown.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters could result in activation of cancer genes like R-RAS in gastric cancer  or PTEN in glioma.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation induces genome instability in cancer. It causes recombination of chromosomes, insertion and deletion of genes. So  activation of tumorigenetic genes and inactivation of suppressor genes could be accumulated. We have many inactive genes of   retroviral origin. Those are LTR retrotransposones, SINEs, and LINEs. They should be inactivated by DNA methylation.  Genome-wide hypomethylation induce those intergenic genes unstable. It means chromosomal instability. It causes translocation, amplification, insertion, or deletion. Imprinting of genes could be disrupted by hypomethylation. Then it causes overexpression of certain gene, like in Wilms tumor.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele, imprinting control regions (ICR) are methylated. It blocks the ICR to bind transcriptional repressor CTCF. CTCF blocks H19 promoter methylation, spreading from ICR methylation.   Without CTCF,   H19 promoter is methylated. </p>
<p>In contrast, maternal ICR are not methylated. CTCF binds ICR of maternal chromosome. CTCF blocks H19 maternal promoter methylation, so H19 is not methylated.</p>
<p>Maternal CTCF binding of ICR blocks downstream enhancer to access Igf2. Paternal methylated ICR can not bind CTCF, so the downstream enhancer stimulates Igf2 gene expression.  </p>
<p>Ii Wilms tumor, maternal ICR is also methylated. So the CTCF can not bind ICR. Downstream enhancers can access Igf2 in both chromosomes. The Igf2 products are overexpressed twice. Igf2 is insulin like growth factor. It promotes cell growth.<br /> H19, imprinted  maternal  expressed transcript,  may supress cell proliferation. H19 is also supressed in Wilms tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabin is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DMTi).  In cancer cells,  promoters of   tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. Thus the cell can not suppress the oncogenes.  Hypermethylation might occur in imprint control regions, and this also could contribute tumorigenecity.</p>
<p>In the daughter cells,CpG island methylations are maintained by DNA methyl transferase 1 (DMT).  Decitabine blocks DMT, thus CpG island methylations are diluted in the next generation. It can normalize the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, and regain suppressor activity. Those changes, normalization, are heritable in further generations of daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once the DNA is methylated, this is maintained  by DNA methyl transferase in daughter cells. Once the DNA is demethylated, DNA methylation  could never happens in the daughter cells. Thus DNA methylation and demethylation have enduring effect, even in the tumor cells. <br /> The intracellular envioroment is changed after "epigenetic drugs" treatment. This affect drug metabolism of chemotherapy drugs.  DNA methylation might introduce  chromatin rearrangement.  It might open up the chromatin, and helps those drugs to reach active site.</p>
<p>You should avoid these drugs during epigenetic reprogramming stages. There are some sensitive period. One is slow growth period. This is prepubertal period, and it means germ cell maturation.   "Epigenetic drugs"  treatment affect DNA methylation, and those changes are heritable.  So,  younger children are affected by those changes for life long.  It might cause other tumor in later life. If possible, those treatment should avoid in children.</p>
<p>Of course, in preimplantaiton egg and fetus primordial germ cells need demethylation of imprinted genes. So it is dangerous to use "epigenetic drugs"  for pregnant. It may affect oogenesis or spermatogenesis. So it is advisable to avoid  pregnancy, both men and women for several months.</p></div>
