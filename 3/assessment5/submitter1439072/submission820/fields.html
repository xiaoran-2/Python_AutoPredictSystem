    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark and is copied mitotically. DNA methylation occurs in early development, in primordial germ cell development and later specific stages of differentiation. It play important role for the inactive X chromosomes, gene imprinting, regulation of gene expression and maintenance genome stability.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group directly to cytosine of CpG dinucleotide of DNA. CpGs are clustered into CpG islands. In many cases methylation leads to gene silencing.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG in general occur in three types of DNA regions:</p>
<p>promoters, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>In norm CpG islands of prompter regions and CpG islands shores are unmethylated, or dynamic methylation between different cell types. Unmethylated state of promoters leads to gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands in promoter and CpG islands shores of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated that leads to silencing of tumor supressors. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutation in cancer. Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type and increases with tumorigenicity. At the same time hypomethylation of CpG poor prompters among oncogenes was found (R-Ras, miR21)in cancer.</p>
<p>CpG at intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually methylated in norm. It is important to maintenance of genomic integrity.</p>
<p>Functions of methylation at repetitive elements include silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Also methylation of repeats prevents illegitimate chromosome recombination.</p>
<p>Functions of methylation at intergenic intervals is prevention of chromosomal deletions, insertions, duplications, and reciprocal translocations. Another function is silence cryptic transcription start site or cryptic splice site.</p>
<p>In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated that leads to genome instability.</p>
<p>Percentage of intergenic intervals and repetitive elements in genome is higher than percentage of promoter regions. So cancer characterized genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation and hypermethylation can leads to loss of gene imprinting in context dependent manner.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process resulting in the monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression of a subset of genes in the mammalian genome. Each imprinted gene can be controlled by an imprint control region (ICR).</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of imprinting, abnormal expression of tumor suppressor and oncogene, and thereby increase risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting gene. H19/Igf2 imprinted locus has ICR located between genes H19 and Igf2. ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele and can recruit insulator protein CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhances and thereby prevents Igf2 expression. The enhancers act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On paternal allele ICR is methylated and can’t recruit CTCF. As result enhancers act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. DNA methylation spreads downstream into the H19 promoter, so H19 isn’t active on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>So in norm Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICR of H19/Igf2 on maternal allele was found in Wilm’s tumor. Igf2 was overexpressed because it expressed from both, paternal and maternal allele.</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome also is related to abnormalities in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to DNA-demethylating agents. It’s approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to cute myeloid leukemia or AML.</p>
<p>Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a cytosine analogue modified in position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence.</p>
<p>Cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than other cells in the body so they are more severely affected by drug because they're replicating more.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands in promoter and CpG islands shores of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated that leads to silencing of tumor supressors.</p>
<p>In some hematopoietic neoplasms including MDS, DNA hypermethylation inactivates genes essential for the control of normal cell growth, differentiation, or apoptosis. Decitabine treatment has been shown to reverse hypermethylation of some of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p15 PMID: 18473005) and restore their normal function.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic therapies have big advantage in comparison with routine chemotherapy. They can reverse of gene silencing that is very important in case of abnormal tumor suppressor genes. Also they could stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells because epigenetic changes are copied mitotically.</p>
<p>At the same time drug-induced alteration of DNA methylation influence on whole genome and is copied mitotically.</p>
<p>So applying of epigenetic therapies should be extremely restricted in some sensitive period of development.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is period when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p>There are two major periods of epigenetic reprogramming throughout the genome. The first includes the period of primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature eggs and sperms. The second is the pre implanted and early post implantation period. On both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome when external factor can affect negatively on body development as well as future offspring.</p>
