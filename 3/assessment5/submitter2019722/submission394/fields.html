<h3>Hypermethylation in Cancer</h3>
<h3><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Reports of hypermethylation in cancer far outnumber the reports of hypomethylation in cancer. There are several protective mechanisms that prevent the hypermethylation of the CpG islands. These include active transcription, active demethylation, replication timing, and local chromatin structure preventing access to the DNA methyltransferase. To date, numerous genes have been found to undergo hypermethylation in cancer.The genes that are susceptible are the genes involved in cell cycle regulation (</span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p15<sup>INK4a</sup>, Rb, p<sup>14ARF</sup></em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">) genes associated with DNA repair (</span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">BRCA1, MGMT</em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">), apoptosis (</span><em style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DAPK, TMS1</em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">), drug resistance, detoxification, differentiation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.</span></h3>
<p> Although certain genes such as <em>RASSF1A</em> and <em>p16</em> are commonly methylated in a variety of cancers, other genes are methylated in specific cancers. One example is the <em>GSTP1</em> gene, which is hypermethylated in more than 90% of prostate cancers but is largely unmethylated in acute myeloid leukemia.The mechanisms involved in targeting of methylation to specific genes in cancer remain to be determined. In one report, the leukemia-promoting PML-RAR fusion protein induced gene hypermethylation and silencing by recruiting DNA methyltransferases to target promoters. Interestingly, retinoic acid treatment induced promoter demethylation, gene re-expression, and reversion of the transformed phenotype.</p>
<p><strong> <span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;">Folic Acid, Gene Polymorphism, DNA Methylation, and Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p>The role of nutrients in affecting gene expression through interaction with genetic polymorphism and modulation of DNA methylation has received considerable attention recently. The disruption of homeostasis in the vitamin-dependent, one-carbon (methyl group) metabolism affects the risk of heart disease, neural tube defects, and cancer. Such disruption can occur as the result of deficiencies of the two essential micronutrients involved in this metabolism: folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12).</p>
<p>A recent study examined the effect of folate status and the MTHFR C677T polymorphism on genomic DNA methylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear-cell DNA. It was found that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism influences DNA methylation status through an interaction with folate status</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Disruption of genomic imprinting in cancer</strong></p>
<p>In addition to silencing known and candidate tumour suppressors, aberrant DNA methylation affects expression of imprinted genes. Loss of imprinting (LOI) of <em>IGF2</em> and the tightly-linked <em>H19</em> locus has been associated with tumorigenesis in a variety of patients. In Wilms' tumour, imprinted expression of <em>IGF2</em> is commonly relaxed resulting in maternal allele expression. This is associated with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the tightly linked <em>H19</em> locus. Similar patterns of LOI for either or both of these loci have been seen in patients with hepatoblastoma,uterine leiomyosarcomata cervical carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma,rhadbomyosarcoma, gliomas and colorectal cancer. It is not known if LOI of <em>IGF2</em> or other imprinted loci is a cause or a consequence of neoplastic transformation, however, the importance of <em>IGF2</em> in human cancer is supported by the observation that patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) express both <em>IGF2</em>alleles and are predisposed to several cancers.</p>
<p>The mechanisms and methylation events underlying the LOI at <em>H19</em> and<em>IGF2</em> vary from tumour to tumour, however, maternal allele methylation is commonly acquired at sequences that include the <em>H19</em> promoter and <em>IGF2</em>enhancer blocker which can simultaneously silence <em>H19</em> and activate<em>IGF2</em> on the maternal chromosome<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;">.</span> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.<br /><br /> Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo. However, there have been no studies of decitabine-induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is a new approach for the  treatment of  cancer, known as epigenetic therapy. Rather than killing cancer cells by damaging their DNA or disrupting vital communication pathways, epigenetic therapy attempts to change the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45671">DNA</a>, including a process called <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=655031">methylation</a> that turns genes on or off..</p>
<p>When chemical tags called methyl groups attach to a DNA molecule, genes can be turned on or off. DNA methylation plays an important role in gene regulation in cancer.</p>
<p>The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to “reprogram” the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells,</p>
<p>This reprogramming can alter the activity of critical genes in cancer cells that drive their growth and survival.</p>
<p>Although epigenetically directed therapy shows promise, there are still many unknowns.</p>
<p>The drugs may be having other effects. Epigenetic therapies may affect <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/022112/page4">the structure of chromatin</a>, the complex of DNA and proteins that forms chromosomes, which could cause side effects over a long period. In patients with advanced cancer, who have few treatment options, this may not be a significant concern,</p></div>
