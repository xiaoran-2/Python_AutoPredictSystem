    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG Islands is almost exclusively causing the silencing of gene expression. Normally, genome wide CpG islands are hypomethylated but the silencing when this area is methlyated is one of the many layers that is needed for the natural process of X-inactivation. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In cancer the CpG islands have a much greater tendency to be hypermethylated throughout the genome thus disrupting normal function. This hypermethylation contributes to cancer by suppressing the expression of tumor suppressor genes. This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to the disease process by being one of the hits to the DNA of the cell. This is explained in the Knudson hypothesis where in order for cancer to occur you would need to have more than one of the tumour suppressor genes silenced and would need many other hits for cancer to occur</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is thought to promote genomic stability by silencing of cryptic promoters and silencing of splice sites. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also very important in genomic stability. The methylation can silence these repetitive elements so they do not transpose themselves into inopportune places in the genome. It also silences the repeats so that you do not have transcription into downstream genes. Also helps to prevent illegitimate  recombination. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally found to be hypomethylated where they would normally be methylated. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA hypomethylation contributes to disease by causing illegitimate recombination, transposition of repeats into wrong places in the genome and allowing of cryptic promoters to be expressed into downstream genes when they shouldn’t be.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal methylation pattern of the paternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster is the ICR is methylated and this allows for the expression of Igf2 because CTCF is not insulating the ICR and so the enhancers can work to express Igf2 and H19 is silenced. In the maternal allele CTCF is insulating the ICR and so it is unmethylated and therefore the enhancers will not work on Igf2 and therefore Igf2 will be silenced in the maternal allele and H19 will be expressed. Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumor is disrupted because the maternal allele becomes methylated so now you have Igf2 being expressed from both the paternal and maternal allele instead of just the paternal so you now have double the dosage of Igf2. This contributes to the disease because it enhances over expression of growth promotion which is common in cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor or DNA-demethylating agent. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation occurs when the target cell duplicates and brings in Decitabine into the DNA. Then when DNMT1 comes to bind it to the other copy- the daughter strand, it becomes a permanent bind and is no longer available to be released. The drug has an anti-tumor effect because it has removed the methylation that is causing the silencing of the gene that would normally be active as a tumor suppressor.  So now more tumor suppressors are available. Also the cancer cells are duplicating much faster and therefore are more highly effected by this process.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and so is carried on from one cell to the next thus carrying on the effect that the drug has laid down. A sensitive period is defined as a wave of epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenome is being remodeled by the removal and addition of epigenetic marks across the genome. The sensitive periods of development occur during 1) Primordial germ cell development up to the production of mature eggs and sperm. 2)Pre-implantation and early post-implantation in early development. 3) There is also a period called the “slow growth periods” which is 9-12 years for males and 8-10 years and fetal- infant life for females whereby negative effects during these times could cause health effects in grandchildren down the road. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs as they work now most likely effect all of the cells of the body not just the cancer cells. So making a massive change to the epigenetic programming could potentially have very negative effects to people in these sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
