    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hyomethylating drug. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting methylthranferase. By removing the methyl marker, it tends to activate genes that were previously silenced or inhibited by their hypermethylation. It activates the cancer suppressor genes that had previously been turned off. The erasure of the methyl marks is passed on to the daughter and granddaughter cells and so on. This loads the tumor with a greater number and percentage of cells that are more susceptible to apotosis, induced naturally or by a chemotheraputic agent. "cancer cells are much more reliant on DNA methylation for survival than normal cells" Dr. Issa By demethyalizing the tumor, it give a survival advantage to normal cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells and so on, thus continue to pass on the chemotherapy induced epigenetic changes long after the initial chemotherapy drug treatment. A sensitive period of development is a period of time where most epigenetic reprogramming occurs.</p>
<p>The prenatal period of germ cell development is a key time of epigenetic programming. Three developmental periods, preconception, preimplantation, and gastrulation, appear to be particularly sensitive because they are peak periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Treating patients, or pregnant women during these sensitive times with hypo or hyper methylating chemotherapy agents would probably skew the epigenetic marks on the developing embryo too much and result in a detrimental outcome to the embryo and its children. Those epigenetic changes are, after all, carried on to subsequent generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most CpG islands are usually unmethylated, but some become methylated in various cell types and cancers. This results in the silencing of a normally active gene. This epigenetic change continues to be passed on to daughter and grand daughter cells. Some of these genes are tumor suppressor genes. When they are turned off it leads to uncontrolled growth of cells, which is a hallmark of cancer.     In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements  tend to lose methylation marks, resulting in increased genomic instability. Repeat hypomethylation near genes or promoters could disrupt transcription of tumor suppressor genes by several mechanisms, including transcriptional interference or generation of antisense RNA and recruitment of the RNAi machinery. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are regions of DNA that are usually hypermethyalated and thus kept from expressing themselves. When their methylation marks are removed, it creates much instability with repeat DNA sequences, DNA inserts from viruses, and ancient genes, long silenced, express themselves.</p></div>
