    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><em>a.Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</em></p>
<p>In the normal case, CPG islands (at the promoters of genes) are mostly unmethylated. Only a small subset of CPG islands get methylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>b.Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</em></p>
<p>DNA Methylation at CpG islands forms a condensed (repressive) chromatin structure. This methylation is done by CPG binding proteins like MeCP1 and 2 which have a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain. This DNA methylation at CPG islands causes a silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>c.Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.</em><br />When hypermethylation occurs at CPG islands, it silences the tumor suppression genes which control cell cycle, cell death (apoptosis), and/or DNA repair. This gene silencing contributes to cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>d.Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</em></p>
<p>In the normal case, unlike CPG islands which are mostly unmethylated, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. At intergenic regions, the methylation of DNA appears to maintain genomic stability by silencing certain transcription start sites and splice sites. At repetitive elements, DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity by selective silencing and mutation of the repeats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>e.Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</em><br />The disruption at integenic regions and repetitive elements is through DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>f.Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</em></p>
<p>When hypomethylation occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it causes genomic instability due to bad recombinations, bad transpositions, and interference with neighboring genes. The genome wide loss of methylation is a prominent feature found in all types of cancer, and is more consistently found than genetic mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>a.Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </em></p>
<p>The paternal allele of the ICR (Imprint Control region) is methylated. This prevents CTCF binding. The H19 promoter is methylated, but the enhancers are allowed to access Igf2. So, the Igf2 gene is expressed paternally but not the H19 gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>b.Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </em></p>
<p>The maternal allele of the ICR is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind. CTCF, being an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, but allows the enhancers to access the H19 promoter. So, the H19 gene is expressed maternally but the Igf2 gene is not expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>c.Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour. </em> <br />In Wilm's tumour, you have a loss of IGF2 imprinting, and both paternal and maternal alleles are transcribed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>d.Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</em> <br />When you have a loss of IGF2 imprinting, both paternal and maternal alleles are transcribed. The hypermethylation of the ICR (Imprint Control region), and over-expression of Igf2, contribute to Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>a.Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to. </em></p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>b.Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</em></p>
<p>It is a DNA demethylating/hypomethylating agent, which means it can be used to reduce DNA methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>c.Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </em></p>
<p>Cancers in humans can be caused by excess (hyper-) methylation that epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes,  resulting in tumor growth and spreading. Drugs such as Decitabine help reduce this methylation and suppress the tumors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>a.Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</em> <br />Epigenetic changes can be passed on to children cells during mitosis, and those cells in turn can forward the changes to their children cells, and so on. This forwarding of epigenetic changes through mitosis can continue until the epigenetic changes are erased. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>b.Define what is meant by a sensitive period. </em></p>
<p>"Sensitive" period refers to a period of development during very early pregnancy that is susceptible to environmental factors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>c.Identify sensitive periods of development.</em> <br />The periods of pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development during pregnancy are "sensitive" periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>d.Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</em> <br />Experiences during sensitive periods of development can be programmed into the developing foetus (and particularly into the primordial germ cells). These can have lasting effects over multiple generations.</p></div>
