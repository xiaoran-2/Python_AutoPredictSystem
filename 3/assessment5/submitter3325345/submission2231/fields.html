<p>Simply cancer results due to over activation of oncogenes and inactivation of suppressor gene which work oppositely in normal cells. This disruption can be caused by genetic mutations as well as epigenetic alterations</p>
<p>Two primary mechanisms are involved in the epigenetic process:DNA methylation  and covalent modification of histones</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an mitotically heritable mechanism. This is a post-replication DNA modification, by the addition of a methyl group to carbon 5 (C5] of the pyrimidine ring of cytosines, predominantly in cytosine-phospho-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides</p>
<p>The decisive developmental effect of DNA-methylation on gene expression is the long-term silencing of gene expression. proper  DNA methylation is essential for cell differentiation and embryonic development. Errors in methylation could give rise to various diseases like cancer.</p>
<p>When Tumor suppressor genes (TSG) become silenced due to hypermethylation of CpG  islands while CpG islands in oncogenes become activated due to hypomethylation, results in abnormal growth and cancer.  </p>
<p>Because Intergenic regions and repeats are unnecessary they are kept hypermethylated and kept in heterochromatin and inactive for normal cell functioning. If they become hypomethylated   their activation will occur , causing  genetic instability i.e make their copies leading to chromosomal misalignment , abnormal expression of genes resulting in disease.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is altered due the malfunctionig or absence of some enzymes and hormones that regulate normal DNA methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-4bb2f7209cdc292165330a2f/970238/asst-5/970238-52132e8d478670.79779549.png" alt="" width="638" height="251" /><br />"Imprinted genes" don't rely on traditional laws of Mendelian genetics, which describe that both parental copies are equally likely to contribute to the outcome. The impact of an imprinted gene copy, however, depends only on which parent it was inherited from. For some imprinted genes, the cell only uses the copy from the mother to make proteins, and for others only that from the father.</p>
<p> IGF2 is growth regulator gene.CTFC is an insulator protein insulate igf2 from downstream enhancers, in maternal allel imprinting control region is not methylated that why CTFC binds ICR, enhancers  can  not excess igf2 causing inactivation of IGF2 but activation of H19 while in paternal allele methylation of ICR block CTFC binding. enhancers can access IGF2 and activate it. But inactivate H19. IGF2 and the H19 genes are imprinted. The IGF2 is paternally expressed, while the H19 gene is maternally expressed</p>
<p>Disrupted imprinting of IGF2/ H19 may result in is a recurring theme. Wilms’ tumor, a childhood cancer of the kidney, is often associated with defects in the WT1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor of <em>IGF2</em>. and  results <em>IGF2</em> overexpression in maternal allele and supression of H19, enhancing cell growth leading to cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks switches genes on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and acetyl groups. The nature of these reactions means epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention . This lead the research to discover cemicals that can be used to control cancer by interfering epigenetic marksabnormalities. These process of treatment is called drug treatment.</p>
<p>There are many drugs on trial bases one of them is decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. And histone-deacetylase inhibitors, made by Celgene and by Merck, another New Jersey-based firm, are being used to treat a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>These drugs suppress the cell growth causing antitumour effact.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>More recently, researchers led by Stephen Baylin at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore, have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>That is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>early development period is sensitive period during which methylation of DNA takes place. if drugs are given at this period , these drugs will disrupt the normal methylation ultimatoly will cause abnormal growth.</p></div>
