    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, there is a higher degree of overall methylation of DNA than there is in cancer cells. However, the opposite is true of methylation at CpG islands of promoters of genes.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the CpG islands that are located at the promoters of genes are rarely methylated. If they are methylated, this blocks the transcription machinery from binding to the promoter, thereby silencing the expression of the gene downstream of that promoter. In this way, normal cells are able to use DNA methylation as an epigenetic regulation mechanism. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. By silencing these tumour suppressor genes, tumours are no longer suppressed and cancer is free to develop. This is similar to a loss-of-function mutation in a tumour suppressor gene (although epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations). Indeed, CpG island methylation is seen in all tumours and is even mitotically heritable, making it a very effective way to silence a tumour suppressor gene, and the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is more frequently observed than mutations in these genes. </p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells are usually methylated and help to maintain genomic stability and integrity. In cancer cells, this function is disrupted as the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats. The repeats may misalign, and, as hypomethylated chromatin is open, recombination may occur when it should not. Additionally, hypomethylation leads to oncogene activation, contributing to cancer formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells do not show imprinting. They either express or do not express both maternal and paternal alleles. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, this can lead to twice the normal dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene and causes Wilm's tumour when made in excess as when imprinting fails. How this happens is as follows. The Imprint Control Region in cancer cells is hyper methylated on both maternal and paternal alleles. In normal  cells, the maternal allele in the Igf2 cluster is not methylated, allowing CTCF to bind and causing the enhancers to enhance H19 transcription. Igf2 is not transcribed from the maternal allele in normal imprinted cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the maternal allele is hypermethylated, leading to no CTCF binding and allowing the enhancers to enhance Igf2 transcription. Therefore, twice the amount of Igf2 mRNAs are transcribed and translated. Ifg2 is then free to send inappropriate proliferative or growth promoting signals and cause tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). These nucleoside analogs are incorporated into the DNA, and, once there, they bind DNA Methyl transferase irreversibly, preventing it from carrying out its usual function of methylating DNA. Decitabine thus causes DNA demethylation. It does not target any specific gene loci, rather, it targets the epigenome as a whole, and while it may correct the locus-specific hypermethylation in the CpG islands and shores of tumour suppressor genes, it may bring about genome-wide hypomethylation in repetitive regions and CpG poor promoters. </p>
<p>If the hypermethylation of the CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes is removed by agents such as Decitabine, transcription of these genes can commence, allowing them to carry out their tumour suppressing function. This is the anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so making alterations to the epigenome can affect all daughter cells of dividing cells that were altered. Care should be taken before administering drugs that alter DNA methylation to any patient who is growing, or any patient who is carrying a growing embryo, and also any patient who is planning on conceiving. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods in epigenetics include the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. They occur right after fertilization and also at the pre-implantation stage and during primordial germ cell development. During these sensitive periods of development, the organism is susceptible to changes to the epigenome. Any treatment made at these times must consider this. </p></div>
