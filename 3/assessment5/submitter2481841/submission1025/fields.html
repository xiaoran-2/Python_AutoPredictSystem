    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is known to be one of the many epigenetic factors that alter a gene expression without a change in the DNA sequence. These alteration could be beneficial (in normal development) or deleterious (in cancers) depending upon the gene(s) that it alters. DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides region commonly called CpG Islands. In normal cases CpG islands and CpG Island shores usually remain unmethylated, allowing gene transcription. Additionally, DNA methylation within the gene bodies avoids spurious transcription initiations. DNA methylation is also the base for different epigenetic phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation, imprinting or the formation of heterochromatin etc.</p>
<p>DNA methylation generally takes place along the whole genome, and its disruption is a typical hallmark of cancer. In cancer cells, CpG islands and CpG island shores may be strongly methylated. As a result, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and aberrant transcription may occur from incorrect transcription start sites. Two major types of modification in DNA methylation are known to commonly occur in cancer compared to normal cases. Firstly, cancer cells show global genomic hypomethylation or overall loss of 5-methyl-cytosine, which has been linked with chromosomal instabilities, as well as activation of normally silenced repetitive DNA elements. Secondly, hypermethylation of the promoter region of gene(s) such as Tumour suppressor gene can occur throughout tumour development resulting in silencing of the gene concerned and therefore prevents its expression.</p>
<p>It is also seen that in normal cases, methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive sequences prevents genomic instability and also protect the genome from transposable elements, as well as spurious transcription initiations. Moreover, transposable elements that are in a methylaed state cannot be activated. In cancer cases, however, global hypomethylation triggers genomic instability and aberrant transcription initiations. Simultaneous activation of transposons may also lead to gene disruption. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism which generally results in expression of one parental allele. DNA methylation represents one of the best candidates for conferring parental-specific expression patterns because DNA methylation is differentially acquired in the parental germ lines, maintained following fertilization, and subsequently employed to silence the non-expressed allele. One of the best examples of such regulation is observed in H19/Igf2 locus</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 are two imprinted genes located within the same chromosomal domain. Igf2 is normally transcribed from the paternal  allele while H19 is transcribed from the maternal . Imprinted expression in both genes is regulated by an imprinting centre  in which the maternal allele is unmethylated  and the paternal is methylated . The imprinting centre contains CTCF binding sites to which CTCF binds only if they are unmethylated. Binding of CTCF blocks the activity of the enhancer element  located downstream of H19 and restricts activity to H19 expression . In Wilms' tumour, imprinted expression of IGF2 is commonly relaxed resulting in maternal allele expression. This is associated with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the tightly linked H19 locus. In Cancer, Methylation of the CTCF binding sites prevents the binding of CTCF and allows the enhancer to activate IGF2 and this biallelic expression of the CTCF binding sites results in IGF2 overexpression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer medication that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (certain types of blood or bone marrow cancer). It interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors<em>. </em>The active substance in decitabine is a ‘cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue’ which is similar to cytidine deoxynucleoside, a fundamental component of the genetic material of cells. In the body, decitabine is converted into decitabine triphosphate, which is then incorporated into the DNA (genetic material) where it blocks the activity of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are responsible for promoting the development and progression of cancer. So, by blocking DNMTs, decitabine will block the division of tumour cells and lead to their death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is a well known fact  that epigenetic modifications are passed on during cell division i.e. from one cell generation to that of another cells until these modification are actively erased. And once erased they do not return back. Similarly, tumours cells that are subjected to epigenetic drugs may show some epigenetic modification that might reverse the cancerous activity of the tumour cells to a certain extent that may then be passed down to the next generation of cells.Thus epigenetic drugs can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period  of development when external environmental factors has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of an individual and  when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks).</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development include</p>
<ol><li>Primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm</li>
<li>Preimplantation and postimplantation periods.</li>
</ol><p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because <span> these drugs may alter and modify the germ line epigenetics and in the long run the inheritance of epigenetic information.</span></span></p></div>
