    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in normal cells are largely unmethylated and DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter regions generally turns down gene expression. </p>
<p>CpG islands are usually hypermethylated in cancer, especially in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation in tumor suppressor- associated CpG islands aberrantly shuts down the expression of these tumor suppressor genes and consequently interupts normal controls over many critical cellular process. In general, this disruption gives the cell an advantage in survival, proliferation and metastasis contributing to tumorigenesis. </p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive regions are generally methylated to silence the repetitive elements and DNA methylation in these regions contributes largely to maintainance of genome stability. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly hypomethylated in tumor cells. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation in repetitive elements leads to abnormal turn on of the repeats. The activated repeats sometimes contain transposable elements that might serve as promoters to further activate many oncogenes. Also, hypomethylation in intergenic and repetitive regions generally increases genome instability that contributes to an increased occurrence of genetic variations including mutations as well as chromosomal translocation, amplification and deletion. These together leads to tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that are responsible for DNA methylation in human. </span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine binds to DNMTs irreversibly and inhibit their catalytic function so that after replication, DNMTs will not be able to complete DNA methylation on the newly synthesised strand thus causes DNA demethylation. </span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine causes DNA demethylation in a replication-dependent way. Tumor cells are generally hypermethylated in CpG islands and the hypermethylation leads to abnormal silencing of tumor suppressors. Decitabine's demethylation effect should help revise the effect caused by hypermethylation and since tumor cells divide far faster than normal cells, this replication-dependent drug should have much higher effect on tumor cells than normal cells. Therefore, low-dosage Decitabine can reduce the hypermethylation in cancer cells while still be tolerated by normal cells. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are preserved during replication and cell division by DNMT1 so that they are passed on to daughter cells. Therefore, altered DNA methylation will also be preserved after division and thus have enduring effects on the epigenome. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is the time when there is massive epigenetic reprogramming going on in normal development. Epigenetic patterns are more easily disturbed in this period and consequently, diseases related to abnormal regulation in the epigenome are more likely to occur. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development include periods for pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p>The targeting of epigenetic drugs is not perfectly only to cancer cells. Normal cells might also be affected by these drugs. And treating patients during sensitive period have a high risk of causing epigenetic deregulation of developing cells and interrupts the normal procedure of cellular developmen, thus have a high risk of having enduring side-effects and may cause further developmental problems to the patients and possibly their offsprings. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated to prevent the binding of CTCF to the insulator element so that the enhancers will act on Igf2 and turn on Igf2 expression. </p>
<p>On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and is binded by CTCF. CTCF binding will insulate the enhancer effect on Igf2 so the enhancer act to activate H19 expression and Igf2 is not expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, ICR is hypermethylated in maternal allele as well. So ICR is methylated on both alleles, and Igf2 is also expressed on the maternal allele. </p>
<p>The disruption of methylation at ICR in this case cause overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting protein, and this overexpression leads to an advantage of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. </p></div>
