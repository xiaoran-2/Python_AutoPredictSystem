    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, heavy DNA methylation is found at intragenic and repetitive sequences. At CpG islands in promoters, it is used as a regulatory measure to ensure activation or silencing of the particular gene. In cancer cells, there is a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and regional gains. CpG island hypermethylation is found at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair, thereby silencing them and leading to tumerigenic growth like with the RB gene in retinoblastoma and the MLH1 gene in colorectal cancers. According to the Knudson hypothesis, multiple hits to the DNA are required to bring about cancer and DNA methylation may be one of the hits. Increased methylation has been seen at CGI shores and CIMP as well. Also, a genome-wide hypomethylation is found, which correlates with the intragenic sequences and the genome-wide repeats, leading to their activation. These repeats then disrupt the genome via illegitimate recombinations, translocations, deletions and insertions leading to genomic instability. There may also be activation of cryptic promoters hidden within the intragenic sequences. These are seen in mouse models with a decrease in methylation due to DNMT1 deletion and in humans where a mutation in the DNMT3B gene leads to ICF syndrome. Also, in cancer cells, there is dysregulation of methylation at ICRs which leads to the loss of imprinting, which means that in pre-neoplastic tumors, the underlying genes are either expressed from both alleles or silenced in both alleles, leading to cancerous growth as can be seen in Wilm's tumor where there is IGF2 overexpression. Essentially the role of DNA methylation is context driven and can either enhance or suppress tumors, depending on where it is expressed or inhibited.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, due to dysregulation of methylation at ICRs, there is a loss of imprinting. This leads to silencing or activation of genes in both alleles, leading to tumerigenic growth as seen in Wilm's tumor. The H19/Igf2 gene has the following sequence. The Igf2 gene is located upstream of the ICR region and the H19 gene is located downstream followed by the enhancers. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and binds to CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from enhancers, which then act upon H19 and facilitate the production of a lnc RNA (miRNA). In the paternal allele the gene is imprinted i.e. the ICR and the H19 promoter regions are methylated. The enhancers then bind to the Igf2 gene and enhance its expression. Disruption with imprinting, in this case, leads to either no expression of Igf2 (both alleles behave like the maternal allele) or overexpression of Igf2 (both behave like the paternal allele). The Igf2 is a growth promoter and turns into an oncogene when it is overexpressed. This is what happens in Wilm's tumor, especially due to the hypermethylation of the ICRs in both alleles, leading to Igf2 overexpression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylase inhibitor (DNMTi) and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which develop into acute myelogenous leukemia. DNMTs are responsible for transferring methyl groups to the DNA, particularly to cytosine residues. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and when administered, it is incorporated into the DNA while replication. It then irreversibly binds DNMTs, thereby reducing methylation in the genome. In low concentrations, more decitabine is incorporated into genomes of cancer cells, as they replicate more, and correspondingly, DNA methylation is reduced in cancer cells. This ensures that the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes are unmethylated or at least slightly less methylated and hence controls the cancer growth. However, in high concentrations, it is toxic as the drug is not cell specific and it doesn't help with the cancer either. Overall, Decitabine acts as a DNMTi and brings down myelodysplastic syndrome and is well tolerated by patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are usually heritable and stable during the lifetime of an organism. They are reestablished in the epiblast stage in a tissue specific manner and are maintained throughout the life of the organism. Alteration of DNA methylation in somatic cells during drug treatment will therefore ensure that the altered epigenome is preserved during the life of the organism i.e. when the altered somatic cells divide by mitosis, they will retain the altered epigenome. The sensitive periods, when it comes to the epigenome, are the early development period (gamates to blastocyst), where the maternal and paternal genome are demethylated (epigenetic marks are reestablished in the epiblast) and the primordial germ cell (PGC) development where the genomes (imprinted genes) are again demethylated (epigenetic marks reestablished in gametes). As epigenetic marks are required for maintaining genomic stability and for the proper working of the genome, any changes in these periods may lead to severe consequences for the organism. Treating patients during these sensitive periods may lead to unintended alterations in the epigenome, as the epigenetic drugs are not specific and hence can have disastrous consequences. For example, DNMTi during PGC development would remove DNA methylation at imprinted genes and this could lead to tumors similar to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
