    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation (DNAme) at CpG islands it's to  X chromossome inactivation and some some mechanism that happen at the chromatin level.The DNAme of CpG island is disrupted cancer by hipermethylation of  CpG island promoters and that lead to silenced genes.Disruption of DNAme at CpG islands contributes to disease becuase it appears more often on the promoters (60%) and since DNAme it's inversely corretaled with gene expression, on CpG that doesn't occur despite their normal or abnormal activity. DNAme at intergenic regions and repetitive elements have functions like repression of transcrioptional noise from start sites,inhibiton of antisense transcription, RNA splicind and replication timing. With those processes ( DNA hipo and hypermethylation plus the reaction that it makes) the normal function of gene expression is altered and leads to disease in particulary cancer, some tumoral genes are expressed or overepressed and that cause cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A lot of cancers are caused by mutations that makes one enzymes overactive or induce overegulation, so one of the reasearches were using decitabine. Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called <span>DNA-demethylating agents</span><span>.</span>Decitabine is normally used with  <span>histone-deacetylase inhibitors</span>, both have an impact on DNA methylation in a way that slow down the tumor and help's with the chemotherapy. The effect anti-tumour is act like an anti<span>myelodysplastic drug and inhibit DNA methyltranferase wich lead to DNA hipomethylation, cell differentiation or apoptosis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 acts as a tumour supressor and Igf2 <span>is a paternally expressed imprinted gene that regulates fetal growth.</span></p>
<p>DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p></div>
