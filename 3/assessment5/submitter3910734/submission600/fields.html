    <div class="field-value"><p>First of all, we have to say that CpG islands are usually unmethylated. Due to methylathion is an inactive epigenetic mark, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. When methylation occurs, meCpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repression chromatin structure, then meCpG can prohibit transcriptional factor binding and alter gene expression. In cancer, what we can see is an hypermethylation of CpG island and this cause a silencing of the tumour suppressor gene which can lead, with other features, to cancer. This hypermethylation tend to differ by the different types of tumours. We can also see an hypermethylation in ICRs and it can lead to an overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>Either intergenic regions or repetitive regions are usually methylated. The function of the methylated intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability working with Dnmt1. Then it can maintain a normal karyotype.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity; it is done by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, by mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition, by silencing of repeats, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and by methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination; another function of this kind of methylation is a genome defense model, for example to protect the genome from transposable elements. These regions can be disrupted, producing cancer. These disruptions consist on the hypomethylation of those parts, and then these parts can’t maintain neither the stability nor integrity. It can success an illegitimating recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>As in the hypermethylation, hypomethylation effect can be stage specific and different tumours can have different dependencies. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA promoter methylation inhibitor and it exhibits some antitumor properties. It has been shown that low-dose of decitabine in malignant diseases is focused on myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>When an increase in DNA methylation success this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When this genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated and it can produce cancer.</p>
<p>The way Decitabine's anticancer effects acts seems to be twofold; the first one is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. The second one belongs to the category of antimetabolites, very similar to normal substances within the cell. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated on the parental allele and unmethylated on the maternal one, which means that is parentally imprinted.</p>
<p>This operates through a long noncoding RNA that's being produced and this is called H19, it is being produced just from the maternal allele. On the patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated, CTCF can not bind anymore; so there is not insulator action and these enhancers are free to act on lgf2 and promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. This is why lgf2 is expressed only from the parental allele and not the maternal allele</p>
<p>The reason that H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele is because DNA methylation spreading. So this DNA methylation, can spread downstream into the H19 promoter and then it is silenced because it's a CPG island promoter.</p>
<p>There is an illness that you get two copies of the chromosome from one of your parents and none from the other. You have no Cdkn1c expression and up regulation of IGF2. This display both fetal an post-natal overgrowth and it predisposed the children to embryonic or childhood tumors. The most common one is the Wilms tumor which is the loss of those geno suppress genes because of the loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a period when the effect of experience on the brain is particularly strong during a limited time in development. These periods allow experience to instruct neural circuits to process information in a way that is adaptive for the individual.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods found in the early development are the formation of the gametes, the fertilised eggs, the blastocyt and the epiblast. The ones in the PGC development are the primordial germ cells and the gametes; is before this PGC development that case the somatic maintenance, making the DNA methylation has an enduring effect on the epigenome. </p>
<p>Patients in that kind of periods are more sensitive to the environment and the surroundings, so it will not be recommended to treat patients in that period because drugs can alter the patient in an over-dosage way or even, make them be addicted more easily so the body can get used to it faster. </p></div>
