    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When CpG islands are methylated, this silences nearby genes by forming repressive chromatin structures and blocking transcription factors. In normal cells, the majority of CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer cells, there is often hypermethylation of CpG islands; in particular, CpG islands are methylated such that tumor suppressor genes are silenced. This helps unleash the rapid growth of tumors within the victim.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly methylated. This increases the stability of the genome, since intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to cryptic start and splice sites, transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, there is often hypomethylation at these sites, because the various unstable effects listed above all contribute are all mutations that could spur the growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR (imprint control region) is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. Thus in the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, the H19 promoter becomes methylated and silent, and downstream enhancers are free to activate lgf2. Meanwhile in the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the ICR prevents the downstream enhancers from accessing lgf2. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, mutations in imprinting cause the maternal allele to act like a paternal allele (uniparental disomy). This leads to an increase in lgf2, which is an oncogene. Thus its over expression causes rapid growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an example of a DNMT inhibitor. After becoming incorporated into DNA, Decitabine binds DNMT, thus causing DNA demethylation. This is useful in regions of hypermethylation, which in tumour cells is common around tumour suppressor genes. Thus it helps these tumour suppressor genes become active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because changes can be meiotically or mitotically heritable. A sensitive period is a period in development when the environment influences epigenetic control. Sensitive periods in development include the period of growth as two gametes meet, join as a fertilized egg, then develop into an epiblast, and also the period when gametes are forming within your body. Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable because any mutations acquired during these periods might also adversely affect future generations.</p></div>
