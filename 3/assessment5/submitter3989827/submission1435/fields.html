    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically found in or near promoter regions of genes, where transcription is initiated. DNA methylation at CpG islands regulates gene expression in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcription factor(s) to DNA and second, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as <a title="Methyl-CpG-binding domain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl-CpG-binding_domain">methyl-CpG-binding domain</a> proteins (MBDs). <a title="Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl-CpG-binding_domain_protein_2">MBD</a> proteins then recruit additional proteins such as <a title="Histone deacetylase" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone_deacetylase">histone deacetylases</a> that can modify <a title="Histone" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone">histones</a>, thereby forming compact, repressive chromatin structure, termed <a title="Heterochromatin" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a>.</p>
<p>Global changes in methylation levels as well as modifications of methylation patterns of individual genes - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. It is commonly known that inactivation of certain tumour suppressor genes and growth-regulatory proteins occurs as a consequence of hypermethylation at CpG islands in the promoters. Numerous studies have demonstrated a broad range of genes silenced by DNA methylation in different cancer types.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements seems to maintain genomic integrity in the following ways. First, silencing of repeats prevent the mutagenic transposition that can occur. Second, methylation of repeats allows compaction of this particular chromatin that prevents illegitimate recombination. Third, because DNA methylation is mutagenic and the mutation of the repeats (meC to T) is more likely to occur this may prevent transposition as well. Finally, silencing cryptic transcription start sites of intergenic regions and strong promoters of repetitive elements can lead to avoiding transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions is observed in the development and progression of cancer. Hypomethylation of repeats contributes to carcinogenesis via destabilization of the genome by recombination between non-allelic repetitive elements, transposition activated repeats and activation of cryptic promoters that can lead to the disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and this means it's paternally imprinted, seeing as the DNA methylation. In this case, an insulator protein (CTCF) cannot bind to ICR. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads downstream into the to H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers can access Igf2 to promote its expression (there is no insulator action of CTCF).</p>
<p>The imprinting control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele, so an insulator protein (CTCF) can bind to ICR preventing Igf2 from accessing the enhancers (there is no Igf2 expression). In this case, enhancers can act on H19 and enhance H19 expression (a long noncoding RNA).</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour is associated with loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. In this case, there is hypermethylation of the imprinting control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, the expression of Igf2 can occur. As a result there is overexpression of Igf2 which is growth promoting gene. In fact, in cancer it has been shown that loss of imprinting occurs commonly and can lead to activation of the silent copy of growth promoting genes such as Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), a nucleoside analogue, is a <a title="Pharmaceutical drug" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug">drug</a> for the treatment of <a title="Myelodysplastic syndromes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndromes">myelodysplastic syndrome</a> progressed to AML. It belongs to DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) inhibitors and it is known as DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine can be incorporated into DNA and work by inhibition of DNA methyltransferases, causing hypomethylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function of aberrantly silenced genes in cancer is restored causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumour cells. Importantly, an increase in DNA methylation can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes and in consequence cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Preliminary experiments have suggested that the <em>p15</em> tumour suppressor gene becomes demethylated following Decitabine treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation pattern is mitotically inherited by daughter cells following cell division. That is why drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period means the time when epigenetic reprogramming of the maternal and paternal genomes occurs and the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. During this period, it is observed erasure and active remodeling of epigenetic marks. There are two sensitive periods: period of primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. During the process of <a title="Gametogenesis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametogenesis">gametogenesis</a> the primordial germ cells must have their original biparental <a title="DNA methylation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation">DNA methylation</a> patterns erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent. After fertilization the paternal and maternal genomes are once again demethylated and remethylated. This reprogramming is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes.</p>
<p>It is very important to remember that every cell could be affected by epigenetic drugs. Therefore, treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods can lead to disruption of the epigenetic machinery. In younger patients those drugs have an effect on developing germ cells.</p></div>
