    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal chromatin is condensed (compacted) due to methylation, with only a few areas being exposed for transcription.  This tight compaction of the DNA is important in maintaining genomic stability. Furthermore it has been discovered that CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) islands are methylated (on the hemi-methylated daughter strands) by DNMTa and DNMTb during development. This often causes the silencing of promoters of gene expression. Also, methylation can prevent recombination of repeats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements (LTRs) are methylated and helps maintain genomic stability.  However, if there are no DNMTs operating efficiently then deletions, loss of chromosomes, reciprocal translocations, or insertions can occur.  All of these can cause transposition of the LTRs leading to mutations or unwanted transcription. These “copy-and-paste” or “cut-and-paste” regions need to be silenced by methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One cause of cancer is when the tumor suppressor genes are silenced by locus-specific  (or islands) being hyper-methylated.  This removes the “brakes” from cell division and the cells divide out of control, forming a tumor.  In another situation, the 5-methyl cytosine at a CpG island might mutate to thymine (point mutation).</p>
<p>Cancer can also be caused by the presence of a mild promoter going the opposite way of the original transcription. This would cause interference of the transcription of the original. Finally, there can be passive demethylation caused by dilution of methylation though multiple cell divisions or by active demethylation due to TET protein activity.  In either case, genomic stability is compromised and cancer may develop.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the main ways that disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer is in the loss of expression of growth-repressing areas or over-expression of growth promoting genes such as Igf2.  In the paternal strand, methylation occurs on the imprint control region (ICR) and extends to the H19 promoter, which is then silenced. This methylation results in the enhancers activating Igf2, which leads to unchecked cell division.  If this occurs in the kidney (in children only), it is called Wilm’s tumor.  Normally in the maternal strand, the CTCF blocks the imprint control region (ICR) causing the enhancers to activate the H19 promoter rather than Igf2. This keeps the mitotic rate in check.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA-methylating agent and belongs to the same group as azacitidine (Vidaza). It is used to treat cancers such as “myelodysplastic syndromes” which leads to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNMTs after being integrated into the DNA. Because its action is dependent on replication, it targets the more mitotically active cells (cancer cells). It is non-specific and division dependent but the dosage must be at a minimum for effectiveness. Too high of a dosage is toxic. Other mechanisms may be active but we do not yet know what those mechanisms are. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Baylin suggests that by targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators might help enhance the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy. This is believed to occur  because the tumor cells have been changed in some way and makes them more vulnerable to chemotherapeutic treatments.  This would be fine for adults, but these epigenetic regulators are methylated and de-methylated during critical (sensitive ) times during development. These sensitive times are during the primordial germ cell development and during periods of cell differentiation.  Altering the epigenetic factors (particularly by erasure) during these times could affect the reinstatement of methylation where it is needed so it can still be mitotically passed onto daughter cells.</p>
