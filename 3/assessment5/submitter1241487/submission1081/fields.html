    <h1>Submission 1081 from Anon (session_user_id: 9297e0d80ada95cd3083a6c0b815326c6ba8e6f2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. Decitabine as a nucleoside analogue it gets incoporated into the DNA uppon replication, therefore tumor cells which are replicated more, may be affected more, than the healthy cells because tumor cells are replecated faster . When the DNA methyltransferase comes to bind to the nucleotide with decitabine in order to copy the methyliation to the daughter strand the dna methyltransferase is irrevesibly bound and can no longer be released. So decitabine cause dna demethyliation in tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is the resault of DNA changes that are caused by genetic or epigenetic or both genetic and epigenetic factors.</p>
<p>In normal cells CpGs are hypomethylated, but in cancer cells CpGs are methylated and as a resault this causes the silence of tumor suppressor genesgiving cancer cells competitive advantage over the surrounding tissue. Cancer cells are able to devide more rapidly than the helthy calls and not die.</p>
<p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, but in cancer cells these areas are hypomethylated. This may lead to genomic instability and may cause illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements who normal would be heavily methylated, activation of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes such as R-RAS (found in gastric cancer).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The example of H19/Igf2 is about the hypermethyliation of the imprint control region in both maternal and parental allele, as a result it leads to over production of Igf2.</p>
<p>In normal cells parental imprint control region is methylated as a result CTCF can't bind  this region therefore the enchancers act on igf2 and H19 is silent.</p>
<p>On the other hand in normal maternal allele the imprint control region is not methylated. When the imprint control region is unmethylated, CTCF can bind and as a result the enchancers act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor we have loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele. As a result we have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele and we have a double dose of igf2 in contrast with a normal cell which is growth promoting factor and is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
