    <h1>Submission 1019 from Anon (session_user_id: bf8adbf7b9666e98aeb85ccfe6f446cf0645af4e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA is not methylated at CpG islands. When they are methylated, they silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer contributing to disease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. In cancer, they are not methylated contributing to desease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A hypermethylated paternal ICR represses <em>H19</em> gene transcription by inducing epigenetic changes at the <em>H19</em> promoter, preventing CTCF from binding to the ICR, and enhancing <em>Igf2</em> expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a hypomethylated ICR on the maternal allele works as an insulator by binding a CTCF protein, preventing the activation of the <em>Igf2</em> gene from the  and allowing <em>H19</em> expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is a hypermethylation of both paternal and maternal ICRs, so <em>H19</em> gene trascription is repressed and enhancing <em>lgf2</em> expression.</p>
<p>Resulting in an overexpression of growth promoting genes contributing to desease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>It hypomethylates DNA.</p>
<p>A combination of products (including DNA-demethylating agent and histone-deacetylase  inhibitor) make cells more susceptible to chemotherapy as they produce epigenetic changes passing on during cell division and reduce the number of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passing on during cell division, so once the change is made there will be less and less cancer cells, and this will give normal cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is an interval of time when external events will have significant impacts on development with epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the gamete, egg and blastocyst stages.</p>
<p>It seems too early and unadvisable effects could occur.</p></div>
