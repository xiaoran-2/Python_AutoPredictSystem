    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal DNA-methylation affects gene expression, inversely, at promoter regions.  In cancer cells CpG islands are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hyper</span>methylated, which causes the transcriptional silencing of the genes located in those islands. (Hassler and Eggler, 2012).  In experiments determining the direct causal role of DNA methylation on the downregulation of tumor-suppressing genes, mice with targeted mutations in the Dnmt1 gene, where a disrupted genomic imprinting was located and tumor formation was reduced, were studied (Jones and Laird, 1999).  So if the genes located on the hypermethylated CpG islands were not expressed, it was expected that more tumors would form. One line of evidence for a causal role of DNA-methylation in the early stages of tumor formation came from studying sporadic cases of mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinomas.  In most colorectal carcinomas with (MS1), the promoter CpG islands of the (MLH1) are hypermethylated.  When a cell line prepared from  these tumors is  treated with Decitabine, the MLH1 genes of these tumor cells are demethylated, MLH1 proteins are transcribed and accumulate, and the mismatch-repair activity is restored.  This proved that hypermethylated CpG islands is most likely the causal role of the inactivation of MLH1.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to-- silence genomes of foreign origin (replicated transposable elements and viral sequences) that may be harmful to the host genome, and to maintain genetic integrity.  (Allis, Jenuwein, and Reinberg, Ch.3, 2006; also <em>Epigenetics</em> Blewitt, Greig, et al, Week 1, part 6, slides 3&amp;4); should any deleterious transposons be inserted and integrated, it may cause point and/or shift mutations in the sequence transcription, misreading, and possibly tumor formations.  The effect of cancer mutations on intergenic regions is one of genome-wide <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hypo</span>methylation (<em>Epigenetics</em> Blewitt, Greig, et al, Week 6, part 4, slides3&amp;4).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, an insulator protein, CTCF, is bound to the maternal allele but not the paternal allele; the ICR at the paternal allele is methylated.  Downstream of CTCF along the maternal allele is located the H19 gene, followed by enhancers.  It was thought the enhancers accessed the Igf2, but it was later found that this was blocked.  Due to chromosome looping, the enhancers access the H19 gene instead.  On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to the paternal allele, and since the H19 allele is methylated, it is silenced.  The enhancers then access the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In the case of WT, the ICR or IC1 region contains a 2.2 kb microdeletion in the maternal allele (Prawitt,et al,  <em>PNAS</em> 102, 2005).  Experiments of affected fibroblasts, the Igf2 gene was overexpressed.  Based on what is known of the H19/Igf2 cluster, they deduced that the maternal Igf2 copy was "paternalized".</p>
<p>H19 has been known to be a tumor suppressor gene; disruption of its expression within the H19/Igf2 cluster of chromosome 11p15.5 (Moulton and Crenshaw <em>Nature</em> 1994) would silence transcription of H19, thus more tumors would form (hence WT).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is part of a class of the epigenitic inhibitors called hypomethylating agents.  What this class of drugs does is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase, thus causing a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hypo</span>methylated transcriptional environment.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat AML in a similar sense to the H19/Igf2 cluster example where H19 is a tumor suppressor.  If the expression of H19 is disrupted, then more tumors form; but if allowed to transcribed, H19 does its job and prevents tumor formation.</p>
<p>Likewise, it was found that Decitabine can treat hematopoietic malignancies by reactivating silenced genes such as p15^INK4b, HIC1, p21^CIP1, and p57^KIP2 (Plimack, Kantarjian et al, Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma, 48, 2007).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know from epigenetic studies that certain epigenetic marks are transmitted from parent to offspring, or from grandparent to grandchild, lecture examples (Week5) given--Överkalix cohort where there was a correlation between the increased amount of food supply for the paternal grandfather was linked to a higher incidence to a grandson's mortality due to diabetes or CVD.  This is explained by epigenetic markers that have not been "erased" and have been passed on during cell division to the daughter and granddaughter.  In this no-scientific journal article, Dr. Baylin explains that it is very well possible that, the epigenetic changes due to these methylase inhibitors can be inherited by a patient's offspring, thus causing an inherited treatment.</p>
<p>A "sensitive period" is a time during embryogenesis and gametogenesis development when the fertilized egg or gamete is susceptible to epigenetic changes due to its environment.  This occurs because the fertilized egg and gamete are in a process of cellular division; the chromosomes are unraveled (to be replicated), and methylation levels are lowest.  During this point in development the genes are exposed and demethylated, thus allowing genes normally methylated (and protected) to be exposed to environmental changes (and thus epigenetic changes).</p></div>
