    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, an abnormal epigenetic process of DNA methylation inactivates tumor supressors or promotes oncogenes, allowing for unregulated cell growth. As cancer progresses, global methylation decreases but CpG island methylation increases, regardless the tumor type. Methylation mistakes accrue over a lifetime and are likely a routine part of aging but in cancer, unregulated cell growth causes disease state. The Knudson Hypothesis suggests that cancer development requires several “hits” at different locations for the unregulated growth to proceed to disease.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated.  CpG islands are associated with promoters of gene activity and are generally protected from methylation or silencing.  When CpG islands become methylated, gene expression is silenced, as was learned from the study of X-inactivation. </p>
<p>Silencing likely occurs because methylated CpG islands attract binding proteins MeCp that either repress transcription or abnormally condense chromatin, reducing its availability for the signals normal for reproduction.   Since CpG island hypermethylation is mitotically heritable, it is a powerful and effective loss of control over cell growth regulation.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpG is hypermethylated and is likely a protective mechanism, as proposed by Timothy Bestor.   The function of DNA methylation here is the maintenance of genomic integrity.  It achieves this goal by silencing Long Terminal Repeats (LTR) from their strong urge to copy and insert mutagenic messages.  The silencing happens by condensing chromatin and/or interrupting transcription and illegitimate recombination of similar-looking repeats.    </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genomic instability: deletions, insertions, translocations.  Without proper regulation provided by hypomethylated normally functioning CpG, the repeats can jump around within the gene and insert themselves or copy and paste themselves.  In their illegitimate locations, they can promote or repress gene expression in ways that override normal cell regulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, imprinting provides a process that protects genome integrity by controlling epigentic markers during gametogenesis.  The expression of one parent-of-origin allele is enhanced while the other parent-of-origin allele is silenced, usually achieved by DNA methylation.  </p>
<p>For example, regarding Igf2 expression, the paternal allele lacks CTCF protein.  This lack allows DNA methylation to occur on the H19 promotor which is, as a result, inactivated, allowing enhancers to access and activate Igf2.</p>
<p>The CTCF protein is present in the maternal allele, however, and acts as an insulator protein, protecting Igf2 from action by downstream enhancers.  Since the H19 promotor in the maternal allele is not methylated, enhancers can access it. Igft2 is therefore silent in the maternal allele. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, as commonly occurs early in pre-neoplastic (cancerous) tissues, hypermethylation of the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele causes the maternal allele to loose its ability to inhibit Igf2 activity.  </p>
<p>As H19 becomes methylated, the protective action of the CTCF protein is blocked on the maternal allele.  With both maternal and paternal alleles expressing growth factor, growth factor is overexpressed and Wilm’s tumor can result.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Its goal is to turn around a dysfunctional epigenetic process by targeting enzyme activity, specifically, methylation of CpG islands.  </p>
<p>When CpG islands become over-methylated, as they do in some neoplasms, it silences their ability to promote tumor suppressors.  The delivery of de-methylating agent (Decitabine) inhibits the aberrant methylation process, although it is not target-specific and has potential to affect methylation in any cell division.</p>
<p>The action of Decitabine depends on cell replication.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that mimics a methyl group. It inserts itself into DNA during cell replication. When DNMT replicates it for delivery to the daughter cell, it becomes irretrievably bound and unavailable for delivery to the daughter cell. In this way, future CpG islands return to a demethylated state. Decitabine works best in early development of cancer, and at lower doses than originally predicted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic markers are mitotically heritable.  Therefore, the purposeful alteration of dysfunctional DNA methylation by drugs that alter an epigenetic process should remain in place throughout future cell divisions, with enduring effects on the epigenome.  Heavily methylated CpG islands that result from a dysfunctional epigenetic process are especially common in those tumors most responsive to drugs that alter DNA methylation.</p>
<p>A sensitive period refers to a period of cell division which affects gene expression broadly throughout the organism or even into the next generation.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development occur when cells responsible for processes related to transgenerational reproduction occur.  Those periods most critically involve gametogenesis and the cell division that occurs during pre-transplantation and early post-transplantation of a fertilised egg.  Sensitive periods also exist during the normal rapid cell division of organ-specific development.  The timing of that kind of sensitive period depends on the developmental timeline for each organ.</p>
<p>The potential for adversely affecting the entire organism makes epigenetic treatments for cancer during sensitive periods inadvisable.  Since active remodeling of the epigenome occurs during gametogeneis and embryo development, engineered changes could become meiotically heritable, or permanently influence mitotic inheritance causing dysfunctional expression by affected pluripotent cells.</p></div>
