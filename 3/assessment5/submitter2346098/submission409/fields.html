    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are unmethylated. CpG islands are usually found in promoter regions. When these are unmethylated the gene can be expressed. DNA methylation will cause gene silencing.</p>
<p>In cancer, tumor suppressor genes will have hypermethylation of CpG islands. This will lead to loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, disturbing growth and cell death. The cancer cell will survive and will not be repaired, so the cell can continue to grow and divide into more cells, contributing to the progression of cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are important for genomic stability. This means that genetically the genome is normal and no chromosomes are lost, gained, or recombined.</p>
<p>Quit early in tumorgenesis, hypomethylation of these regions occur, and this progresses with time. The DNA is not densely packed and an illegitimate recombination can occur. Also, because of the hypomethylation, repeats can be activated and make a copy of themselves and jump around in the genome or transpose. This can lead to activation of neighbouring genes, but it can also disrupt the coding region of a gene it jumped into. In conclusion, this leads to additional deletions in cancer and to insertions gaining parts of chromosomes. When the activating genes are oncogenes (e.g. growth genes), this will lead to the progression of cancer, but when tumor suppressor genes are deleted this will also lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 cluster is methylated in the paternal allele. The enhancer can therefore not promote expression of H19 (CTCF will not bind to this element), and IGF2 is expressed.</p>
<p>For the maternal allele, the H19 cluster is not methylated. CTCF4 will bind to its insulator element, so the enhancers will act on H19 and this will be expressed. IGF2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there is no expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele lost imprinting and the imprint control region is hypermethylated. Therefore, the enhancer activates IGF2, and H19 is not expressed. Both maternal and the paternal allele have now expression of IGF2. IGF2 expression leads to growth. Because you have now a double dose of IGF2 expression, compared to a normal cell, you have growth promoting, which can lead to tumour formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methylation changes as it is a DNA demethylating agent. It is used in blood cancer, and not solid cancers. Because these cancers divide very quickly they are affected by the drug, and not the surrounding cells. The drug can easily reach its target since they are in the blood stream. It has a general mechanism of demethylating the cancer cells. This can lead to upregulation of the tumor suprressor genes, which are hypermethylated in cancer. Activation of the tumor suppressor genes can be inhibit cell proliferation, cause cell death of cancerous cells and thus have anti-tumour effects.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks that are established are stable and will be transferred via mitosis to the next cell. This will lead to enduring effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when it is likely that an (external) agent will cause an effect. For epigenetic effects the sensitive period is during early-gestation when epigenetic reprogramming occurs during fetal development and during mid-gestation, when primordial germ cells are produced. During an adult life epigenetic effects can still occur, only one single cell with an uncorrected error can lead to cancer, but it is less likely than during fetal development. Treating adult people with these epigenetic drugs will mostly lead to effects in cancer cells, and not in normal cells. Treating people during a sensitive periods is inadvisable. The effects that will occur are unknown, but they are likely to be very serious side effects to the fetus because these drugs will interfere with epigenetic reprogramming, causing life-long effects (if the fetus is still viable).</p></div>
