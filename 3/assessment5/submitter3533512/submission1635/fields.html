    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions with high concentrations of cytosine and guanine nucleotides occupying adjacent positions. These islands are between a couple hundred base pairs to several thousands in length. CpG islands are typically located near the transcription sites of genes and thereby methylation of these sites regulates the availability of these sites to the transcription machinery. Recent research has revealed that there is a tendency towards hypermethylation in cancer which silences the expression of the underlying gene. Indeed it is now widely accepted that disruption of CpG site methylation underlies at least partially the pathogenesis of a multitude of disease conditions. DNA methylation acts to suppress the transcription of repetitive DNA elements as well as DNA that has been injected into the genome by viruses. In cancer repetitive elements and intergenic elements are often hypomethylated which leads to the production of aberrant protein products. These can contribute both directly and indirectly to cancer.  One mechanism whereby methylation is disrupted in cancer is through mutations of epigenetic enzymes. Furthermore the tendency towards hypermethylation is most prominent in promoters related to cell apoptosis, regulation of cell cycle and tumor suppressor genes. This contributes directly to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a process that is essential for normal development. Immunoglobulin-like factor 2 (IGF 2) codes for a mitogen (something that triggers or promotes mitosis). It binds to its specific receptor and eventually leads to cell proliferation. IGF 2 is subject to genomic imprinting in which only the paternal allele is expressed. The maternal allele is silenced and is not expressed. However, this inheritiance pattern is violated in a variety of cancers such as osteosarcoma, lung adenocarcinomas, head and neck squamous cell adenocarcinomas as well as Wilms’ tumor. It is the over expression of this gene that contributes to tumor growth. In most cases the maternal promoter for this gene is methylated leading to its silencing. However, Wilms’ tumors these marks are lost that leads to biallelic expression that promotes tumor formation. </p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which is the enzyme that is responsible for transferring a methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) to the gene promoter. As such Decitabine is classified as DNA methylating agent. Decitabine has a recognized anti-tumour effect although the precise mechanism through which this effect proceed remains to be elucidated. However, observations from the study suggest that while that the Decitabine treatment increases the susceptibility of cancer cells to standard chemotherapy. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects on genome as methylation marks are inherited from parent cell to daughter cell until they are actively erased. As a result it is not necessary to kill all the cancer cells when utilizing an epigenetic treatment unlike conventional treatments. A sensitive period is defined as a time interval during which the organism will experience particularly pronounced responses to epigenetic effects. Embryonic and fetal development can be classified as sensitive periods. Other work, done with rats, has shown that the first ten days of life also constitute a particularly sensitive period in regard to epigenetic effects. The usage of epigenetic based medications at this time would be inadvisable as it will most likely interfere with normal epigenetic processes that are vital for normal development. For example administering a histone deactylase inhibitor during a sensitive period would result in many genes being acetylated when the normal course of development would dictate that they be deactylated. </p></div>
