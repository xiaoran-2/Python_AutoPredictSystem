    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Under normal condition, the CpG island is hypomethylated, and the repititive regions and intergenic regions are methylated. These states of mythylation in necessary for maintaining the genomic stability.  Hypomethylation of the CpG islands is responsible for active expression of tumor supressor gene thereby preventing neoplasia or tumor growth. The repititive regions and intergenic regions initiate transcription of particular gene, which under normal condition in silenced.</p>
<p>When there is epigenetic or genomic disruption such as exposure to carcinogen/oncogen, or mutation during cell division, there can be a shift in the methylation process whereby there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands and genomic hypomethyaltion of the repititive elements and intergenic regions. When there is hypertmethylation of the CpG island, the tumor supperessor gene is silenced  thereby promoting tumor growth(tumorogenesis). During disease state such as cancer, there is also a shift in the methylation state of the repititive elements and intergenic region from methylation to hypomethylation. And since there is hypomethylation of the repititive region and intergenic region, the mutated gene is activated and transcribed resulting in the expression, and thus results in disease process or tumour growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprinted control region is methylated which means that this is paternally imprinted. The matermal allele is unmethylated in the imprinted cell region. When the maternal allele is unmethylated, it is bound to CTCF which is an insulator protein;  which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers which free the enhancers to interact with th H19 to increase H19 promoter expression in the maternal allele. In the paternal allele, the absence of CTCF allows the DNA methylation to spread to H19 promoter to silence the H19 promoter and allowing the enhancers to access the Igf2 activating Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting by deletion or mutation can result in disease.  Many imprinted genes are involved in neoplastic process , and loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.</p>
<p>In wilms tumor , the defect is the selective loss of maternal and reduplication of the  paternal chromosome 11p15.5 alleles. There is a loss of imprinting which  reverses  the maternal chromosome to a paternal epigenotype.There is paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter,  turning off the H19 and turning on Igf2. Since H19 is growth suppressor and Igf2 is  growth enhancer, the result is a neoplasm (wilm's tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to the class of hypomethylating agents. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase, thereby appears to affect DNA in genes that control cell growth. Decitabine works by helping the bone marrow produce normal blood cells and killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow.</p>
<p>Decitabine's anti-tumor effect is based on its being a nucleoside -analogue that induces hypomethylation in the promoter cell regions  in the CpG islands, by a mechanism in which the DNA/nucleotide analogue complex binds to and inhibit dimethyltransferases resulting in hypomethylation.  Abberant DNA methylation in the CpG island is associated with gene silencing of the tumor suppressor gene. Hypomethylating agents, such as Decitabne,  work by desilencing the epigenitically modefied DNA thus promoting the expression of the silenced tumor superssor. Hypomethylation in tumor cells may restore  normal functions to genes necessary for cellular control of differentiation and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  Dr. Stephen Baylin speculates that, " epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy".  This is possible because the genetic changes are mitotically heritable and passed on during cell division to the daughter cells of the next generation until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>The sensitive period of development happens during the prenatal period of germ cell development. This i s the period which  the key time of epigenetic programming of the male happens, and the time frame of development that is shown to be influenced by maternal factors such as dietary methyl donor supply. This the period that the critical period of DNA methylation programming of the nonpromoter, and intergenic sequences occur.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive period is inadvisable because this during  period, external disruptions or pertubations of the epigenetic patterns could result in diminished fertility.</p>
