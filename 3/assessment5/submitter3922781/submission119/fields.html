    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) of the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated in the paternal allele and this methylation blocks the insulator protein CTCF from binding the ICR.  CTCF insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers.  Without CTCF binding, the enhancers are able to activate Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed.  The paternal allele also has methylation of the H19 locus and H19 is not paternally expressed.  The maternal allele, however, does not have a methylated ICR or methylation at the H19 locus and the insulator protein CTCF can bind the ICR.  The binding of CTCF to the ICR blocks the enhancers from activating Igf2 and thus Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele (H19, however, is expressed maternally).</p>
<p>In the development of Wilm’s tumor, loss of imprinting results in hypermethylation of the maternal allele at both the ICR and the H19 locus.  This hypermethylation results in expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele and a double dose of the Igf2 protein when compared to a normal cell.  Igf2 is a growth promoter and the over-expression of this protein results in Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal role of DNA methylation at CpG islands is typically gene silencing.  CpG islands tend to occur in the promoter regions of genes and methylation results in repressive chromatin structure that prevents the binding of transcription factors thus silencing the gene. </p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated.  In comparison, cancer cells show hypermethylation of CpG islands (however, this occurrence is confounded with time as aging individuals also show increased methylation of CpG islands).</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes silences the gene and inhibits the gene’s ability to suppress growth.  The result is uncontrolled cell division and the development of cancer.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability and integrity, respectively.  Studies with DNA methyltransferase1 null cells have shown that these cells lose genomic stability and translocations are common.  Methylation of repetitive elements silences these repetitive elements to prevent transposition and possibly prevent recombination.  The “Genome Defense Model” proposed by Bestor suggests that since DNA methylation is mutagenic (methylated Cs can mutate to Ts) it must provide a benefit and that benefit is most likely to protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements genome-wide are hypomethylated when compared to normal cells (in fact, genome-wide hypomethylation is a hallmark of all cancers studied to date).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor and acts to hypomethylate DNA by blocking the cells’ ability to maintain methyl marks.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA of actively dividing cells and irreversibly binds DNMTs.  This means that Decitabine will actively target dividing cells and reduce methylation in these cells.  We know that cancer cells tend to be hypermethylated in CpG islands and removal of this hypermethylation has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in people with MDS and ALS – cancers of the blood.  Blood cells are relatively easy for drugs to reach compared with the cells of solid tumors.  There are currently trials occurring to test Decitabine’s ability to modify the cells of solid tumors but the results are not known yet.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are typically mitotically heritable so a drug that was able to alter the methylation pattern of a tumor cell would result in daughter cells with the same methylation pattern.  Additionally, methyl marks are highly persistent in adult differentiated cells so these methyl mark modifications would persist past the tiem of drug treatment.</p>
<p>In epigenetics, the sensitive period is the time when epigenetic marks are being actively and passively removed and re-established.  The main sensitive periods are during gametogenesis and early embryonic development.  During these periods, cells are being epigenetically reprogrammed – methylation and other epigenetic marks are being removed and reestablished.  Treating either very young children (whose cells are actively differentiating more so than adults) and pregnant women (whose unborn children are both undergoing epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cells and epigenetic reprogramming of their primordial germ cells) could potentially be dangerous due to disruption of the establishment of normal epigenetic marks.</p></div>
