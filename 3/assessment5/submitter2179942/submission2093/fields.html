    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the basic means to achieve epigenetic phenomena like silencing. Cancer cells can display variations in DNA methylation as compared to normal cells, and it is considered to be one of the important epigenetic cause for cancer</p>
<p>The CpG islands are typically found at the promoters of genes, i.e. regions of the genome where transcription factors bind. These regions are typically exhibit very little DNA methylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands play a role in silencing of gene expression. This happens because the methylation at CpG island either prevents binding of transcription factors or it leads to a chromatin structure, which represses gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation of CpG islands could lead to silencing of tumor supressor genes. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells of this affected cell, would have their tumor supressor genes silenced. These epimutations are quickly selected and fast outnumber the normal cells to give rise to a tumor.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements show high degree of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The main function of the DNA methylation at these regions is to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions, it prevents deletion, insertions and translocation of the parts of the genome. It also silences cryptic transcriptions, which could affect normal transcription of useful genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive regions causes the silencing of genes required for translocation of these repetitive element. This leads to genomic stability, since the translocation could alter the normal function of some other gene. DNA methylation here, also prevent cryptic transcription</p>
<p>In cancer, affected cells lose DNA methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to genomic instability due to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and their translocation which could finally lead to disruption in activity of neighboring genes</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) in the H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele shows DNA methylation. This methylation prevents the binding of CTCF proteins. This in turn allows the downstream enhancers to access Igf2, which leads to Igf2 activation. As a result, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele in normal cell. But due to methylation of the ICR, H19 gene, which produces a long non-coding RNA is silenced.</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) in the H19/Igf2 cluster of the maternal allele is unmethylated. As a result CTCF can bind, which insulates the Igf2 gene from its enhancers, leading to silencing of Igf2. On the other hand, H19 gene is activated and the long non-coding RNA can be produced from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele behaves just like the paternal allele, since its ICR is also methylated. This leads to upregulation of Igf2 and complete silencing of H19.</p>
<p>Igf2 is infact an oncogene. Such oncogenes cause cells which ought to die to proliferate instead. Such proliferation can lead to tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methy transferase inhibitors or DNMTi.</p>
<p>As the drug inhibits the action of DNA methyl transferase, it causes a genome wide DNA methylation in all cells. One thing to remember though is that DNA methyl transferase is needed to maintain methylation when cells divide. Thus DNMTi class of drugs cause hypomethylation in newly formed cells.</p>
<p>In tumors, cells are dividing at a very fast rate, and hence need a lot of DNMT to maintain DNA methylation. Dnmti class of drugs, like decitabine, are nucleoside analogues, i.e. they incorporate themselves within the DNA. They bind the DNMT very well and hence, make them unavailable for methylation maintenance work. In case of tumors caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands, such as in Myelodysplastic syndrome, the methylation is lost in daughter cells due to the action of Decitabine, preventing tumorogenesis,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in general prevents binding of certain proteins to the DNA. Based on where the methylation occurs, it can cause upregulation or downregulation of genes. Thus, alterations in DNA leads to abnormal functioning of the cell</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods during the organism development which are most susceptible to environmental factors. These are the periods when most of the epigenetic reprogramming takes place.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods for development are one, early development where the zygote undergoes a number of division forming a blastocyst, and two, the primordial germ cell development, in which the germ cells are derived from somatic cells.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods would be inadvisable because, the drugs during sensitive periods, the drugs can directly affect the epigenetic reprogramming. If the epigenetic reprogramming fails, it could have long term effects on the patient as well as his/her future generations. This is because, all the epigenetic marks required for the genomic stability and proper gene regulation are being laid down at this point. Any insult at this point could lead to genomic instability, upregulation or down regulation of genes etc. Infact, the effects could be more serious than the disease that is being treated</p></div>
