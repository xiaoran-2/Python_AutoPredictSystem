    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated, so nearby gene promoters are present in euchromatin and may be expressed. In a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. The CpG islands are frequently found in the promoters of tumor suppressing genes, so in a cancer cell, the tumor suppressing genes are not properly expressed and their function is subverted. This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable, so it persists in subsequent generations of cells as the tumor grows. These cells have a selective advantage, due to their proclivity to reproduce and their resistance to dying. They can thus overwhelm the normal tissue.</p>
<p>In contrast, the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to be methylated in a normal cell and unmethylated in a cancer cell. This can lead to the expression of genes, including cancer-promoting oncogenes, that would normally not be expressed. For example, the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to activation of the R-RAS gene, resulting in gastric cancer. Increased transcription of satellite repeats can lead to DNA damage and genomic instability. The exposure to transcription of the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions can result in illegitimate recombinations because of misalignment. The result can be genetic insertions, deletions, and translocations. Normally, the DNA would be densely packaged in chromatin and this would not occur. The genomic instability can also lead to other human diseases, such as ICF syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By reducing the presence of methyltransferase, it tends to diminish the DNA methylation that can occur in cancer cells that are characterized by DNA hypermethylation. This hypermethylation affects CpG islands and can lead to chromatin formation and the silencing of nearby genes. If these genes happen to be tumor suppressing genes, then the  failure to express those genes can lead to the uncontrolled reproduction of tumor cells. Decitabine can potentially restore the proper expression of those tumor suppressing genes and inhibit tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since methylation can be mitotically heritable, subsequent generations of cells can preserve DNA methylation characteristics from the parent cell. Therefore a drug treatment that affects DNA methylation can effect the epigentic characteristics of cells that are produced even after the period of treatment. With the knowledge that therapies may have an effect beyond the period of treatment, it is important to consider the potential long term effects. Also, caution should be taken regarding the effects during sensitive periods, that is, during the development of germ cells and early embrionic development. During these sensitive periods, epigenetic reprogramming is occuring and a disruption to the epigentic mechanics could have a profound impact on the development of the germ cells or the development of the embryo. Drug therapies affecting these periods could therefore have a harmful effect on fetal development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The key methylation differences in the maternal and paternal alleles of the H19 / Igf2 cluster are manifested in the Imprint Control Region. Normally, the maternal allele is unmethylated and the paternal allele is methylated in this region. The lncRNA H19 is therefore being produced from the maternal copy and not the paternal copy. The unmethylated maternal ICR is bound by the protein CTCF, which acts as an insulator from the downstream enhancers, which are then free to enhance the expression of H19 on the maternal allele. CTCF can not bind to the paternal ICR, so it does not insulate the enhancers and they preferentially act on the Igf2 of the paternal allele. Thus we have paternally imprinted expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the Imprint Control Region of the maternal and paternal alleles are both hypermethylated. This leads to an overexpression of the Igf2 gene (double dose), since it is no longer suppressed from the maternal allele. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this leads to a tumor; specifically, a childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>
