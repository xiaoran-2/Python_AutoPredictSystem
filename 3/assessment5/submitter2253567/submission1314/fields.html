    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells, in general, have unmethylated CpG islands, and methylated intergenic elements, repetitive elements, interenic regions and the introns of genes.  The repetitive elements are generally silent which tend to prevent transposition, transcriptional interference and illegimate recombination all of which contributes to genomic stability.  In general the CpG islands, which tend to be promoters of tumor suppressor genes tend to be active and the oncogenes tend to be silent.</p>
<p>    Cancer cells. in general, have methylated CpG islands. The methylation of the CpG islands almost always silences genes, the tumor suppressor genes are now silenced.    The repetitive elements, intergenic regions and the interons of genes, tend to by unmethylated, i.e. hypomethylated, which is the opposite condition in normal cells.  The hypomethylation results in the oncogenes becoming active.  There is also increased genomic instability; transcriptional interference , deletions, insertions,  and reciprocal translocations, leading to mutations.  In cancer cells growth is promoted and the restraints on growth are removed.  The cancer cells are able to avoid cell death, avoid immune destruction, and induce increased blood supply and grow unchecked.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is normally methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), blocking attachment of CTCF protein to the ICR which frees downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2, which is a growth promoter.  The maternal allele is normally unmethylated on the ICR.  The CTCF protein binds to the ICR.  The bound CTCF blocks the downstream enhancers from acting in Igf2 and it is silent, not growth promoting.  Wild’s tumor results from an over-expression of growth involving two regions on chromosome 11. Cdnk1c a growth suppressor normally active on the maternal chromosome is silenced. Igf2, a growth promoter, normally silent on the maternal chromosome is expressed.  Igf2 is also expressed on the paternal chromosome providing an additional growth stimulus.  There is an overexpression of growth from the two Igf2 alleles, both maternal and paternal, and the growth restraint from the Cdnk1c allele is removed. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a  DNA-demethylating agent which leads to the hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase[1].  The hypomethylation of CpG islands would result in the increased expression of tumor suppressing genes and decreased expression of oncogenes resulting in a decrease in the cancer.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that incorporates into the DNA.  Each succeeding generation of cells would have less mypermethylation, the hypermethylation affect dilutes out.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has been shown to be transmissible, in mice, in the maternal transmission of the pseudoaguti phenotype of Aguti Viable Yellow allele and also the maternal and paternal transmission of the straight tail phenotype of the Axin tail allele.  Therefore a drug that alters the DNA methylation pattern has the potential of trans-generational epigenetic inheritance.  There are two periods in development, sensitive periods,  when the epigenetic marks are  removed and reprogrammed, germ cell development and early embryonic, pre-implantation, development. Attempts to introduce  epigenetic changes when the epigenome is being reprogrammed could interfere with the reprogramming and introduce quite unexpected changes</p></div>
