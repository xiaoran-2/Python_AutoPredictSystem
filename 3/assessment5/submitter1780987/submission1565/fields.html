    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Nowadays, DNA methylation alterations are classified in two types: locus specific DNA hypermethylation, where we find CpG island methylation, and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation whose example is the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethilated. As it is showed in the review article the CpG islands are usually located in promotors and "are kept free of methylation independent of their activity state". However, in cancer cells, CpG islands are not all methylated but they are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells. Especially this hypermethylation appears in the promotors of tumor suppresor genes, silencing the activity of these suppressor genes, and allowing cells to grow and form the tumor.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In contrast, the genome is not made up only of CpG islands. Most of the genome-wide is made up by repetitive elements or intergenic regions which are generally methylated in normal cells. One of the functions of this especific methylation is to mantain genomic stability, with the package of the chromatine (in heterochromatine), inactivation of repeats… that is to say to mantain a normal karyotype. But, when we talk about cancer cells, this methylation pattern changes to hypomethylated. This fact induces genomic instability, producing different abnormalityes as deletions, translocations or insertions, because this genome is more accessible and is possible to recombine this repeat regions, to translocate to other locations of the genome (disrupting the genes where they insert), or activate their promotors.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">But generally, DNA methylation alterations are context dependents so different tumors have different dependencies. Therefore, sometimes CpG islands hypermtethylation would be more evident and other times repetitive elements or intergenic regions hypomethilation or the combination between both of them.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the two DNA methyltransferasa inhibitors which FDA has approved to treat myeodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analog, so it gets incorporate into the DNA upon replication, and binds to DNA methyltransferasa irreversibly, thus it can no longer be released.</p>
<p>As the action of these inhibitors is division dependent, above all they affect cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly that most other cells in the body.</p>
<p>Recently this drug has been used at low dosis showing an anti-tumoral effect. These low dosis act in the DNA demethylating range, having a really good anti-neoplastic effect, that is to say, killing the tumor cells. But is still unclear if this DNA demethylation is the only mechanism of action or if it has other effects. Furthermore it is not known which would be the long term effects in normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 imprint blocks the enhancer that promotes the expression of different RNAs in a different when it is a maternal or a paternal allele. In this cluster there are located both Igf2 and H19 alleles and CTCF binding site (a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). There is also an Imprinted Control Region (ICR) that can be methylated.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated. As this region is methylated, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind and, hence, there is no insulator action and the enhancer promotes de expression of Igf2 in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and the protein CTCF bounds to its binding site. Therefore, CTCF is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancer will promote H19 expression, but Igf2 will be silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting consecuently, in both maternal and paternal alleles the ICRs are hypermethilated, and so, the expression of Ifg2 will be promoted in both cases.</p>
<p>So in Wilm’s tumour it will be double dose of Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone, this hypermetilation will lead to tumor genesis in very early stages.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In each stage of development DNA methylation levels should be strictly regulated to allow the correct development. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to next generation’s cells. So we can erase some epigenetic marks in order to avoid a disease but this will endure for a long time until the reprogramming is carried out again.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the period when epigenetic reprogramming happens, that is, the periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, and therefore, it is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals.</p>
<p>Different studies have shown, that there are two ways of reprogramming that occur during  germ cell development and during early development. Both are very sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming, and there is also the time when ICSI or IVF are carried out, and therefore, the development during these stages might be disrupted.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because they may affect both the germ cell development and early development. Furthermore, they may become more susceptible to other external factors, and it does not last just until the treatment provision ends, but also afterwards, settling a big risk against epigenetic changes.</p></div>
