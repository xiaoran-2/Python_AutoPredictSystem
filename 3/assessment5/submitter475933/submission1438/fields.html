In normal tissue, methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates cell function, through the attachment of a methyl group at a CpG site, with CpG methylation usually suppressing transcription. Hypermethylation of introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevent deregulation and instability by suppression. CpG islands, where CpG dinucleotides cluster together in much higher density are usually free of methylation. CpG islands which are promoter regions for the expression of genes and hypomethylation of CpG island regions allow normal gene expression including housekeeping genes that maintain and control normal cellular function, repair and tumor suppression.</span></p>

In normal cell tissue, loss of methylation is evident and accumulates with increasing age, but cancer cells have advanced hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides at the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements. Without suppression of these elements, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations become possible, causing genomic instability with chromosomal rearrangements and recombination.</span></p>

More recent studies have revealed hypermethylation of CpG island shores, which are 2kb regions neighbouring CpG islands may be better predictors of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">The H19/lgf2 cluster are two imprinted genes located within the same cluster and imprint control region (ICR). Monoallelic expression is due to the parent-of-origin inheritance of the allele and expression is controlled by the ICR with associated DNA methylation. </span></p>
<p style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">The unmethylated ICR of the maternal allele, allows a downstream CTCF insulator protein to bind to the ICR, suppressing maternal lgf2 expression but providing expression of H19. Through methylation at the paternal ICR and heterochromatin methylation spreading, silencing the paternal H19. Methylation blocks CTCF insulator protein binding, allowing the downstream enhancers to promote lgf2 expression.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Changes to methylation at the ICR will affect expression and in the situation of oncogenes such as lgf2, can cause the overexpression of growth promoting genes and be a feature of cancer. At the H19/lgf2 cluster, the change of methylation at the maternal ICR to hypermethylation, changes the normally silent maternal lgf2 to be expressed and silences H19 expression. With hypermethylation at the maternal ICR, CTCF insulator protein is blocked from binding, allowing downstream promoters to promote lgf2 expression and with both alleles expressing lgf2, produces a pattern of overexpression of this growth promoting gene that is seen in Wilms tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Decitabine is a drug targeting the enzymatic epigenetic regulators and is a demethylating agent that inhibits methylation by interfering with the DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT) which maintain DNA methylation in cell replication. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi), which in cell replication, where DMNT maintains methylation with genome replication, DNMTi binds to DNMT, stopping it from maintaining the methylation in the following cell replication, which is also lost in subsequent cell replication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">Non-normal hypermethylation can induce gene silencing of tumor suppressors or other cancer related genes. Increased histone methylation can silence genes with H3K9 and H3K27 methylation associated with heterochromatic silencing. Decitabine through DNMTi decreases methylation and if this decrease is associated with repressive H3K9 and H3K27 methylation, then the chromatin could become euchromatic again, expressing tumor suppressor genes and other functional genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>

DNMTi is an inhibitor of DNMT, which is copying methylation over the entire genome to the next generation, and is not target specific. Decreasing hypermethylation in targets that are involved in cancer, allows expression of previously silenced genes, including housekeeping and tumor suppressor genes. But many other methylation marks are silencing introns, intergenic regions and repeats, which if expressed, can induce genomic instability and expression of oncogenes. Also, all cells that are undergoing cell replication are open to DNMTi, and changes in methylation in other cell lineages, may produce negative epigenomic changes, leading these cell lineages into instability. Cancer cells are replicating at higher rates than other cells, which provides more opportunities for DNMTi to bind, but other cell lineages may replicate when excess DNMTi are available.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:15px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;">There are two sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming takes places, after fertilization and in Primordial germ cell (PGC) development. PGC development sensitive period is important in treating cancer as epigenetic marks are demethylated and reset in the gametes. Interference  and change of methylation during this period in PGCs, could have a transgenerational effect with unknown outcomes on subsequent generations.</span></p></div>
