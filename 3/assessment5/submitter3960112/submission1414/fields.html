    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands which are composed of several clustered Cs and Gs in the promoter region tend to be protected from methylation. Only a very small portion of CpG islands are methylated across cell type and time points. The normal function of methylation at CpG islands is the silencing of gene expression. However, in cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated causing massive gene expression silencing in regions of tumor suppressor genes. Because of this silencing, tumor suppressors are inhibited from doing their job. Tumors are then expected to occur due to this silencing.</p>
<p> Unlike CpG islands which are normally unmethylated. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. This maintains genomic stability and integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites and repeats to prevent transposition. In the disease, however, intergenic elements and repeats are hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Genomic instability can lead to genes being constitutitvely on when they shouldn't be or genes being hyperactivated. </p>
<p>In the end, the role of DNA methylation is still context dependent. Different cancers can have different context. For example, depletion of DNA methylation in tumor suppressor hypermethylation can suppress tumorigenesis. On the other hand, depletion of DNA methylation in chromosmal instability may just enhance tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control regions are DNA methylation therefore blocking the CTCF binding. Without the CTCF, DNA methlation spreads to H19 promoters downstream of the ICR and silencing it. The enhancers further downstream of H19 can then access IgF2 to activate it. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR are unmethylated and therefore CTCF is allowed to bind. With CTCF bound, H19 promoter is unmethylated and activated. The nearby enhancers enhance H19 expression and are unable to access IgF2 which is further upstream. </p>
<p>H19/IgF2 imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumor by the hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele. Hypermethylation leads to the blocking of CTCF and silencing of H19 and ultimately the enhancing of IgF2 expression. Therefore, IgF2 expression is enhanced on both alleles causing a massive upregulation of this growth factor. One of the hallmarks of cancer is the overexpression of growth factors causing tumors to grow unexpectedly. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which means it removes methylation in regions where little or no methylation should occur. Usually, DNA methylation causes silencing of gene expression. In tumors where the main cause of tumorigenesis is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, decitabine can demethylate the region thereby allowing the expression of tumor suppressors to prevent tumor-formation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike some modification to the DNA, DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Therefore, massive changes on the epigenome can have long-lasting effects that could be passed down from generation to generation. Not only that but certain periods in the development of a human are considered sensitive periods where epigenetic marks are in its most vulnerable. Early development (pre-implantation) and primordial germ cell development are considered sensitive periods of development. These time points are when epigenetic marks are reprogrammed and cleared to restore totipotency for the next generation. The two waves of reporgramming should be noted especially for treatment with epiegentics-altering drugs like those mentioned in the article. Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable because it is important for epigenetic marks to be repogrammed for the correct development of the individual. Methylating agents might cause unnecesary methylation of regions to be cleared for development. This must be taken into consideration when treating individuals at these sensitive time points. </p></div>
