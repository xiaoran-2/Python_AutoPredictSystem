    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGI) are often found at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation, so CGI are usually unmethylated in normal cells. However some CGI methylation can happen in different times and are associated with dynamic methylation between different cell types. Methylation of CGI lead to silencing of gene expression. The mechanism that silences gene expression in methylated CGI is associated with condensation of the chromatin structure by methylated binding proteins.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CGI in promoter of tumour suppressor genes tend to become hypermethylated, silencing the underlying gene, which disrupt the functions of the proteins that they code affecting for example the control of cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. The CGI hypermethylation will be mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, contributing to the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>CGI hypermethylation varies by tumour type what allows the use of CGI hypermethylation of specific genes or set of genes as biomarkers. The analysis of these biomarkers are a very sensitive and accurate way for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment evaluation.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, which is fundamental to maintain genomic stability and integrity. DNA methylation of repeats is fundamental to silence them and prevent mutagenic transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. Methylation of intergenic regions can also silence the expression of cryptic promoters or a cryptic splice site to avoid transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and specially repeats tend to become hypomethylated in cancer cells what leads to genomic instability and open chromatin in regions that normally have heterochromatin. In cancer, as a result of this instability, you can observe illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters leading to transcription aberration in surrounding genes, deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has imprinting expression regulated by a enhance blocking mechanism. In normal cells, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated and this methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing it’s expression. The ICR methylation also blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTFC, allowing the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 gene, promoting it’s expression. The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated so CTFC binds to it and insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers and Igf2 is not expressed. These enhancers then act on H19, enhancing H19 expression. So, in normal cells, Igf2 gene is only expressed in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, a kidney cancer that typically occurs in children, there’s an hypermethylation of the ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster, causing the loss of imprinting expression. In this tumour the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated, behaving like the paternal allele, with enhancing of Igf2 gene expression. As a result you have an overexpression of Igf2, a double dose compared with normal cells. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene (encodes insulin-like growth factor II) and the loss of imprinting of Igf2 is a common epigenetic alteration observed in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug approved by the FDA used in myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a <em>de novo</em> methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). DNMTi class of drugs are nucleoside analogs and get incorporated into the DNA upon replication. So the action of Decitabine depend on cell replication and since cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, they tend to be more severely affected by the drug action than regular cells.</p>
<p>With the action of Decitabine, when a DNA <em>de novo</em> methyltransferase (DNMT) comes along to bind the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The result, over time, is a gradual demethylation as cell division continues. The demethylation of CGI of promoters restores downstream gene transcription, so Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because of the restoration of gene expression including tumor suppressor genes or genes that can cause apoptosis induction.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic changes caused by drugs that aim the epigenetic machinery in cancer, such as altering DNA methylation status, have enduring effects because this effects, as demethylation of CGIs for example, will be mitotically inherited, passing on during cell division to daughter cells.</p>
<p>The enduring effects and lack of specificity of currently available drugs that act on the epigenetic machinery raises wariness of its use specially during periods considered sensitive for the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of vulnerability due to a large scale epigenetic reprogramming, with the removal and re-establishment of epigenetic marks. These large scale epigenetic remodeling happens in two stages: during early development, from zygote until early post-implantation; and during primordial germ cell development, which starts in mid-gestation embryos and endures until the maturation of the germ cells.</p>
<p>It’s not advisable to use drugs that aim to change epigenetic abnormalities observed in cancer during sensitive periods of development (pregnancy and childhood) because the effect of inhibiting the epigenetic machinery can disrupt epigenetic marks in germ cells, somatic cells and all tissues during epigenetic reprogramming considering that these drugs: have an enduring or irreversible effect (DNMT inhibitors for instance); and are not selective, so will be used throughout the system and every cell could have a potential to be effected by them.</p></div>
