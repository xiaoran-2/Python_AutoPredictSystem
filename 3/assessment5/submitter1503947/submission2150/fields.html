    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG islands are commonly found in promoter regions of genes and they are normally kept free of methylation. In cancer cells, they usually become hypermethylated, which results in the corresponding gene silencing. Disruption of DNA methylation in CpG islands could have as a result the silencing of tumour-suppressor genes which control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, contributing in cancer.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Intergenic regions, which may contain regions of importance for gene expression, such as imprinted control regions, promoters and enhancers, and repetitive elements, such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions, are normally hypermethylated, in order to be silenced and maintain genomic stability. In cancer cells, they are usually become hypomethylated promoting genomic instability (which results in reciprocal chromosome translocations, insertions and deletions, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, disruption to neighbouring genes), hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters (which can activate of oncogenes), deregulation of tissue specific genes, and loss of imprinting. All the above can result either in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or in overexpression of growth promoting genes, contributing to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinted control region in the paternal allele is methylated and the CTCF can’t bind to the ICR, so the enhancers promote the expression of Igf2, but can’t promote expression of H19. In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, so the CTCF binds to it, and the enhancers can’t promote the Igf2 expression, but they promote the H19 expression. In Wilm’s tumour both ICRs, the maternal and the paternal, are methylated. That results in no expression of the H19 gene, and the Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, is highly expressed (in double dose), resulting in childhood kidney tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent, because it acts as DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, it is incorporating into DNA and irreversibly binding to DNMTs when they come to copy the methylations to the daughter strands, so they are replication dependent inhibitors. Since cancer cells replicate in a much higher rate than normal cells, they will be more severely affected.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Altering DNA methylation in a cell can have enduring effects on the epigenome because of the DNMTs that maintain the methylation pattern of the mother cell in the daughter cells, until they undergo epigenetic reprogramming and being erased. Sensitive periods are a periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when there is clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, and a period of development that is susceptible to environments signals. Those pre-implantation development, early embryonic development, germ-cell development (it’s important to note that oocytes remain vulnerable during childhood in females, as epigenetic marks are not established in oocytes until puberty). Creating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because epigenetic changes in DNA methylation is permanent, and it can have an impact on a patient’s descendants if, she is pregnant or if he/she plans on having a child in the future, and in young (especially female) patients effect on germ cells need to be considered.</span></p></div>
