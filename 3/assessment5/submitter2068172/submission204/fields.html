    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG-islands is a part of the epigenetic regulatory machinery. DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable trait allowing cellular adjustments to be transferred to the next generation without altering the DNA sequence.  In normal cells CpG-islands are usually un-methylated as opposed to non-island CpG-sites. In cancer though there is a tendency towards genome-wide hypomethylation and localised hypermethylation at specific CpG-islands. Methylated CpG-islands in promotor regions are linked to down-regulation or silencing of the gene associated with the promotor. Thus methylation of CpG-islands potentially contributes to cancer in conceptually to ways: The first case is the case of hypermethylation at CpG-sites leading to down regulation of genes involved in tumour suppression. The other case is hypo-methylation of CpG-islands normally contributing to down regulation of oncogenes leading to up-regulation of such genes. With an imbalance in dosage of either tumour suppressors or oncogenes cancer risk is dramatically increased.</p>
<p>Non-island CpG-sites, such as intergenic regions, retroviral insertions and repetitive element, are usually methylated in the normal state. This contributes to genomic stability for instance by reducing transcriptional noise from alternative start sites. In cancer the genome-wide hypomethylation affects these sites leading to decreased genomic stability. When the genome in general is unstable, more mutations, translocations etc. occurs leading to additional instability thus further implementing the genomic instability that is a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>The alterations of methylation status associated with cancer in conjunction with the stability of DNA methylation means that methylation status of certain genes is of particular use as a diagnostic or prognostic cancer biomarker. Furthermore the fact that different genomic areas experience dissimilar alterations according to cancer type results in potential use of methylation differences as a way of identifying primary tumour origin, if unknown.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genes Igf2 and H19 are affected by imprinting. In the normal state the imprinting control region is methylated at the paternal allele and unmethylated at the maternal allele. The paternal allele expresses Igf2 by means of enhancers working in cis not affected by the methylated site. At the maternal allele though, the unmethylated imprinting control region leads to binding of the insulator CTCF. Hereby the enhancer function driving Igf2 expression at the paternal allele is blocked and the enhancers promote expression from the H19 locus instead. In Wilm’s tumour imprinting is disrupted at the maternal allele. This means that the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele is methylated leading to Igf2 expression from both. The result is a surplus of Igf2 at the same time as a lack of H19. Igf2 is growth promoting and therefore carcinogenic when produced in large quantities. The imbalance in gene products produced as a result of disrupted imprinting processes is not limited to this particular locus. In general, a disturbance of gene dosage is damaging to cells and has the risk of causing disease. If certain types of genes (tumour suppressors or oncogenes) are affected, there is an increased cancer risk.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent functioning as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. When treated with Decitabine cells are longer able to methylate DNA. Following first round of mitosis hereafter, only DNA strands from the parent cell are methylated. Newly synthesised strands are unmethylated. When several rounds of cell division are completed the original methylation will be diluted substantially and as cells divide, the methylation will disappear as time passes.</p>
<p>As described for question 1, hypermethylation of certain genetic areas is associated with cancer. When such hypermethylation leads to silencing of genes it will potentially be possible to influence the expression of these genes by treating the affected cells with Decitabine. If gene X is a tumour suppressor gene hypermethylated in a cancer patient, treatment with Decitabine will reduce the methylation level in vicinity of gene X (as well as other places). Hence expression level of gene X will increase leading to tumour suppression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically stable and alterations hereof might last beyond the period of treatment. Epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for differentiation of cell types throughout development and silencing of certain genes can last as long as the lifetime of the organism.</p>
<p>Two periods are especially sensitive when considering epigenetics since reprogramming takes place. The first period is when germ cells are established. It is through this time period imprinting patterns from the parents are replaced with patterns corresponding to the gender of the person producing the germ cells. The second period is the early development in the preimplantation period where other methylation markers are reprogrammed.</p>
<p>In periods where such epigenetic marks are established, it is of particular importance to be considerate when treating patients. For instance, if treating a pregnant female, not only  will she be affected by the demethylating agent so will her baby as well as the baby’s future children in the form of primordial germ cells developing in the baby. In this manner future generations are exposed to an agent causing genomic imbalance and hereby put at risk of disease. Since germ cells are not mature until adolescence, the sensitive periods are potentially rather lengthy. </p></div>
