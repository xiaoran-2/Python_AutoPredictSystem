    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic marks on the DNA act as a regulator in the transcription of genes and also gives the chromatine genomic stability. The CpG islands usually are inside the promoter of genes, and the methylation of the this sequence cause that these genes don´t be transcribed. The normal DNA methylation inhibits the recombination between repetitive elements preventing genomic inestability and the effects related to them (translocation, amplification, deletion, etc). In the intergenic regions, we can find criptic weak promoters, the normal methylation in this regions inhibit the possible transcription of no normal genes. The cancer is proposed to have both, genetic and epigenetic sources, regarding the genetic source you can find alteration of epigenetic modifiers due to mutations. In the epigenetic field during cancer, you can find hypermethylaton of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The hypermethylation of CpG islands can be found in the tumor suppressor genes promoters, because of this modification, these genes are not transcribed and the cancer cells can grow without any control. The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause recombination between repetitive elements, activation of transposones and also activation of criptic promoters giving rise to genomic inestability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR and also de H19 gene are methylated so CTCF cannot bind the ICR region. Because of that, the enhancers can act in the Igf2 promoter and this gene can be transcribed. Regarding the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated nor the H19 promoter, because of that the CTCF can bind the ICR region causing that the H19 to be transcribed. The transcription of H19 cause that the enhancers can´t interact with the Igf2 promoter. In Wilm´s tumour the maternal allele has the same epigenetic pattern that the paternal allele, so both Igf2 alleles are transcribed. The Igf2 is a growth promoter so 2 doses of this gene give rise to the tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The epigenetic drugs act in a different way as the standar chemotherapy, due to the fact that the alter in some way the epigenome of the cell. It´s known that there are two sensitive periods in which the epigenetic marks are established, these two periods are early development of the embryo and primordial germ cell development. The alterations in the DNA methylation are mitotically heritable so any modification in this pattern will endure for all somatic life. Taking in consideration the before mentioned information, the pregnant women should not be treated with this medication nor the parents that are looking for have a son. Treating this subpopulations of patient with this drugs can cause the baby to have an alter epigenome and with this any kind of disease.    </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an analogue of the deoxynucleoside citidine and inhibits the DNA methylases in low doses which produce the hypomethylation of the DNA. Taking in consideration this fact, this medication could be used in treating cancer because hypomethylation of the DNA can cause the reactivation of tumour suppressor genes followed by the apoptosis of the cancer cells.   </p></div>
