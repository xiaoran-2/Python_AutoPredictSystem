    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands silences genes. Usually, most CpG islands are unmethylated and genes are active. But in cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes causes tumor suppressor genes to be silenced. Since usually tumor suppressor genes promote genomic integrity by regulating the cell cycle or promoting apoptosis (the cell killing itself when it becomes unable to function normally), silencing of tumor suppressor genes gives cells a chance to become cancerous. The cancer cells, since they have less tumor suppressors, survive and divide better than normal cells and can thus spread rapidly. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions promote genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites and thus preventing transcription of genes that are not supposed to be transcribed and splicing of genes that are not supposed to be splice. Meanwhile, DNA methylation in repetitive elements prevent transposable elements from jumping into parts of the genome in which they do not belong, thus messing up the function of genes. In cancer, a global hypomethylation causes the genome to become unstable--unmethylated intergenic regions may start to express genes from cryptic splice sites, and unmethylated repetitive elements may cause transposition and illegitimate recombination. This can cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes or overactivation of oncogenes, which promotes growth inappropriately. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually, the paternal allele is methylated in the H19/lgf2 cluster and thus the insulator CTCF cannot bind to the imprint control center. Without the insulator, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it, while allowing the enhancers downstream to bind to the lgf2 cluster and activate it. Since H19 is a tumor suppressor and lgf2 is a growth promoter, the paternal allele's H19 silencing and lgf2 activation promotes growth overall. The maternal allele, on the other hand, is usually unmethylated, causing CTCF to bind and insulate downstream enhancers from binding to the lgf2 cluster. Instead, enhancers bind to H19, the gene that it has affinity to but less affinity than lgf2, causing H19 to be expressed. The expression of H19 and silencing of lgf2 in the maternal allele thus has the oppposite effect as the paternal allele by regulating growth. In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region, which means both alleles are methylated. Thus, the cell has two alleles behaving like the paternal allele and promoting growth, and none to restrict it. Since the tumor suppressor gene H19 is silenced and the growth promoter lgf2 is promoted, cancer occurs. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, if an epigenetic drug alters DNA methylation, it can change the epigenetic state of an individual for his/her lifespan. For example, using a drug that lessens DNMT1 expression might mean that some methylation marks will be lost as cells divide, since DNMT1 replicates DNA methylation marks in daughter cells. This may cause side effects over time since DNA methylation is important for normal cells as well as cancer cells. One must be especially cautious with these drugs during sensitive periods when cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming and epigenetic marks are being cleared and reset. Sensitive periods include the period from fertilization to pre-implanation, as well as the development of primordial germ cells in the fetus. Treating patients during sensitive periods might cause a global change in the epigenetic state of an embryo or a primordial germ cell in the fetus since the epigenetic state is being reset at that point in development. For example, using a drug that restricts enzymes that establish DNA methylation marks <em>de novo</em> during this period might mean none of the epigenetic marks in a normal person will be established in the embryo, causing death or epigenetic diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is <span>a nucleoside analog, a substance similar to nucleosides in DNA. Once DNMT1</span>, an enzyme that copies methylation marks from the parent DNA strand to the daughter strand, binds to decitabine during replication, it can no longer be released. This disables DNMT1 function, making it no longer able to copy DNA methylation marks. By inhibiting DNMT1, Decitabine causes DNA methylation levels to decline as cells divide without passing on methylation marks to daughter cells. Decitabine is effective against some tumors are caused by DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands and other sets of genes that silences tumor suppressor genes. It demethylates CpG islands, allowing tumor suppressor genes to be expressed and counter the tumor. </p></div>
