    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands (CGIs) are short sequences of DNA that have a much greater than average density of CG pairs. In normal cells these CGIs are typically sparsely methylated and serve as promoters for nearby genes. In cancer cells these CGIs and the nearby areas, called “CpG shores”, become hypermethylated. The precise location of the hypermethylated CGIs varies by cancer type but this type of methylation appears to be a universal characteristic of all the cancer types that have been examined to date.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If the CGI next to a tumor suppressor gene becomes hypermethylated, the expression of the tumor suppressor gene will become reduced or blocked contributing to the progression of the cancer. According to the Knudson hypothesis cancer is a result of a sequence of disruptive events like this. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable daughter cells will also lack the expression of the tumor suppressor gene.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation limits the occurrence of illegitimate recombinations occurring between unrelated sections of two chromosomes. In many cancer cells these repetitive elements lose their methylation creating genomic disruption by allowing illegitimate recombinations. Recombinations can silence a tumor suppressor gene by separating it from its promoter region. Recombinations can cause an over expression of an oncogene by placing it next to a strong promoter. Unmethylated repeated regions are also subject to transposition. Transposition into the middle of tumor suppressor gene can render it non functional.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>In a normal paternally imprinted allele methylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR) prevents the binding of CTCF to the ICR and allows the downstream enhancers to cause the expression of the growth promoting gene lgf2. On the paternal allele the methylation of the H19 gene prevents the expression of H19.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On a normal maternally imprinted allele lack of methylation of the ICR allows CTCF to bind to the ICR. This CTCF binding prevents the downstream enhancers from accessing lgf2 and so lgf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. On the maternal allele the H19 gene is not methylated and so is expressed. H19 is suspected to limit the expression of the lgf2 by the paternal allele.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Some patients have an imprinting defect that causes both the maternal and paternal alleles to display the paternal imprinting pattern. Because of this defect lgf2 is overexpressed leading to a predisposition to childhood tumors of the kidneys.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a</span><span> DNA-demethylating agent. It is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. In the lecture slides this class of drugs is called DNMT inhibitors. This drug binds to DNMT and stops it from causing newly duplicated, and thus unmethylated, DNA nucleotides from being methlylated to match the methylation of the parent strand. </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;">Because of this each new cell generation reduces the level of methylation. It is important limit the dose in order to prevent toxic effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">It is not yet totally clear how this reduction of methylation is beneficial. One possibility is that since hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is one of the driving forces in cancer progression, reducing the overall level of methylation may allow these genes to resume being expressed.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>When a DNA strand is duplicated the original strand retains its methylation but the newly added nucleotides on the other strand are unmethylated. In mammals DNMT1 recognizes the CG locations where one strand is methylated and the other is not and attaches a methyl group to the unmethylated strand. Because of this activity the methylation of each chromosome is passed down intact from cell generation to generation. Therefore any drug that alters DNA methylation will continue to have an effect even after the drug is removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>A sensitive period is one in which the overall pattern of methylation in a cell is being (re)established. <span><span>In the week 5 lecture “Disrupted epigenetic programming in ART” the Early (embryonic) Development and the later Primordal Germ Cell development period are identified as "sensitive". <span><span>Treating pregnant females during early embryonic development could cause death or developmental defects in the embryo. Treatment of a pregnant female during the time of fetal primordial germ cell development could cause fertility problems in the child or damage to the embryonic gametes resulting in birth defects in the child’s children.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div>
