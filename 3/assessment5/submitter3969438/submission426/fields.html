    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes present monoallelic expression which is achieved through DNA methylation of ICRs. Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of ICRs can result in loss of imprinting, being the gene expressed or silenced from both alleles. As many imprinted genes are involved in growth promoting/suppressing, malignant cells can take advantage by silencing growth suppressor genes or overexpressing growth promoter genes.</p>
<p>One example is the paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster. In the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR allows binding of CTCF, preventing Igf2 promoter from interacting with enhancers. These enhancers are shared by Igf2 and H19 genes. Because CTCF insulates Igf2, these enhancers act on H19 which is maternally expressed, while Igf2 is silent. In the paternal allele, the methylated ICR inhibits CTCF binding, leaving the enhancers free for acting on the Igf2 promoter. This results in paternal silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is associated with cancer. The maternal chromosome can revert to a paternal epigenotype, showing Igf2 overexpression and H19 silencing. Because Igf2 codes for a growth factor and H19 is involved in growth suppression, this loss of imprinting results in uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis, which can be observed in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anti-neoplastic drug that belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA along with the endogenous bases. When incorporated, it irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which cannot be released for further DNA methylation of the daughter strands.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation is a common feature in cancer cells. Hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in gene silencing, namely tumor suppressor genes silencing. Inactivation of the promoters of these genes leads to uncontrolled cell growth, disrupted DNA repair and inhibition of apoptosis, which in turn leads to tumorigenesis. One way to reverse this situation is to reactivate these tumor suppressor genes. Reactivation can be achieved by restoring the DNA methylation patterns of these promoters, that is, a hypomethylation pattern. Decitabine can demethylate hypermethylated CpG islands by inhibiting DNMTs, re-expressing the silenced tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the C5 of cytosines in the DNA. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at cytosines followed by guanines, forming the so called CpG dinucleotides.</p>
<p>About 60% of the promoters of genes contain CpG islands, regions with high CG content. Although DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides, genes’ promoters tend to be unmethylated. However, when methylation occurs, gene expression is silenced by a mechanism involving alteration of chromatin structure and repression of transcription. As so, DNA methylation at CpG islands acts as a repressive mark and is one of the basis for differential gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells however, CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated resulting in gene silencing. This locus-specific DNA hypermethylation occurs at promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. Silencing of these genes disrupts this control, allowing continuous cell growth, inhibition of programmed cell death and inhibition of DNA repair, conferring advantage to malignant cells.</p>
<p>CpG dinucleotides exist throughout the genome in regions other than gene promoters. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements contain CpG dinucleotides and these are usually methylated in normal cells. In both cases, DNA methylation allows the maintenance of genomic integrity. DNA methylation at intergenic intervals prevents genomic instability events, such as deletions, insertions or translocations and allows silencing of cryptic promoters. Methylation at repeats prevents transposition of repeats, illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, a genome-wide hypomethylation can be observed, as these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated. This loss leads to genomic instability, with diverse cellular consequences as the events described above, ranging from chromosome instability, genetic mutation or reactivation of cancer-related genes (such as oncogenes), that are key contributors for the pathogenesis of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two main periods where epigenetic marks are reprogrammed, that is, they are erased and reestablished. These periods – termed sensitive periods – occur during early development and primordial germ cell development. Once established, these marks are maintained in somatic cells and transferred during subsequent divisions in order to maintain tissue specific epigenetic patterns.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) act by reversing the epigenetic abnormalities in cancer cells. In the particular case of DNMTi, they act by preventing cytosine methylation, this way reversing the hypermethylation of CpG islands commonly found in cancer cells.</p>
<p>As epigenetic marks are stable, once we erase cancer altered marks, these do not tend to return. Thus, drug treatment with DNMTi reestablishes normal epigenetic patterns that are transferred through cell division, enabling drug effects to last after the period of treatment.</p>
<p>Although epigenetic drugs can be a suitable alternative to standard chemotherapy, there are particular cases where this option cannot be considered. For example, during pregnancy the embryo in development is subject to epigenetic reprogramming and altering this process can result in severe problems for the fetus. Also, during childhood, when germ cell maturation is still occurring, epigenetic drugs can have adverse outcomes.</p></div>
