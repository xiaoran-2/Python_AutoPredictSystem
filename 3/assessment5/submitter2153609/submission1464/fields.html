    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>With normal DNA the CpG islands are unmethylated, yet the repetitive elements are usually methylated, the intergenic regions and introns within genes are also methylated in normal cells. Whereas with a cancer cell, the CpG islands are often methylated and the rest of the DNA, the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns tend to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p> All tumors studied have found that the tumor suppressor genes have been turned off. The hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs in the promoters of Tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylation silences the tumor suppressor genes. This change to the epigenetic machinary is mitotically heritable, so the daughter cells of the cancer cell will also have their tumor suppressor genes turned off. Different tumour types show hypermethylation of different tumour suppressor genes and can be used to determine the origin of a metatasis.</p>
<p> Hypermethylation of CpG islands within the promotors of tumour suppressor genes increases as the tumour progressors, however hypermethylation of CpG islands is also seen as a hallmark of aging. In addition the areas close to a CpG, known as CpG island shores, are often hypermethylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p> In a normal cell, repetitive elements, intergenic regions are usually methylated and tightly packaged in heterochromatin, whereas in cancer cells, repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns tend to be hypomethylated. This hypomethylation increases as the cancer progresses, leading to genetic instability. With hypomethylation if there is a break in the DNA, then during repair the DNA might incorrectly recombine with repetitive elements on different chromosomes, leading to translocations. Also, hypomethylation of repetitive elements activates them, enabling them to copy themselves and jump around the genome. This jumping around can cause deletions and insertions in sections of DNA, disrupting normal DNA and contributing to disease. Hypomethylation of repetitive repeats and genomic instability is seen in many cancers. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are only expressed by one allele, either the maternal allele or paternal allele. Suppression of the imprinted gene (one which is silenced) is achieved in some cases by hypermethylation and sometimes by hypermethylation of imprint control regions.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the ICR of the H19 gene is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In a normal cell the maternal allele, enhancers work on the H19 gene which is expressed but the Igf2 gene is not expressed. On the paternal allele, methylated ICR results in enhancers activating the Igf2 gene and it is expressed but the H19 gene is not.</p>
<p>A differentially methylated region upstream of <em>H19</em> (H19-DMR), the imprinting control region, determines the reciprocal expression of <em>H19</em> from the maternal allele and <em>Igf2</em> from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In some forms of cancer, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated. This means that the Igf2 gene is expressed on both the maternal and paternal allele. The Igf2 gene is growth promoting; excessive expression leads to cancer, eg.Wilm's tumor of the kidney.</p>
<p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation, disruption of imprinting mechanisms is often seen in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is drug which acts as a DNAmethyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine interferes with the methylation of DNA and is thought to prevent methylation and so enable reactivation of Tumour suppressor genes which had been silenced.</p>
<p>Decitabine is an analogue of a nucleoside and is incorporated into the DNA during replication. However it also binds irreversibly to DNAmethyltransferase enzymes preventing the enzyme from being released. So when DNAmethyltransferases come along to methylate a section of DNA they are caught at the Decitabine and stop the enzyme being able to methylate the daughter DNA strands.</p>
<p>Decitabine is thought to affect all dividing cells and because cancer cells are rapidly dividing the drug will affect cancer cells. However it is also thought to affect all dividing cells, and so may have long term consequences on normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation is important for normal DNA function. DNA methylation regulates genes, turning some on and some off, it is involved in X-inactivation. DNA methylation is important during cell differentiation and also for imprinted genes. During sensitive periods, that is, during germ cell development and early embryology, DNA methylation is stripped and reset.</p>
<p>When a section of DNA has been methylated, this pattern is copied in the daughter cells, thus perpetuating this pattern in those cells.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods, for example during pregnancy, would affect the laying down of the epigenetic markers in the embryo. As methylation pattern is important in cell differentiation, changes to this pattern would have long term effects, as all of the cell line would be affected.</p>
<p>Other problems might arise during production of germ cells. This might have more consequences for females who have all their eggs compared with males who are producing new sperm. If a patient was treated with a drug to decrease methlyation, then this might result in hypomethlyation of their egg or sperm cells and ultimately affecting their children.</p>
