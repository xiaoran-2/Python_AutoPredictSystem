    <div class="field-value"><p>Genome contains non-random distribution of CpG dinucleotides with poor occurrence of these nucleotides at inter and intragenic (Introns) regions and rich occurrence at upstream regions (promoter) of many genes and often called as CpG islands.  Methylation at CpG islands has been associated with the silencing of genes perhaps by blocking the promoters at which transcription factor should bind. In a normal cell CpG islands present in the promoters are un-methylated or hypomethylated and allows expression of downstream gene/(s) whereas CpG dinucleotides present in inter and intragenic regions and in repeats are hypermethylated. Proper DNA methylation at CpG islands is seems to be essential for cell differentiation and development. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides at inter and intra-genic regions and at repeats helps in maintaining genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. It also helps in silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference and may also prevent unnecessary recombination. In disease such as cancer, the reciprocal phenomena is observed where CpG islands in promoters gets hypermethylated and CpG dinucleotides in other genomic regions gets hypomethylated. For example, it has been found that in specific cancerous cells the CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes (e.g BRCA1 in breast cancer) are hypermethylated and has been associated with tumor progression. Hypomethylation at other genomic regions such as at repeats activate the same to promote genomic instability by illegitimate recombination, transposition and disruption of expression of neighboring genes thus by probably causing the normal cell to transform into a cancerous cell. The other cause could be due to the hypomethylation of CpGs in CpG poor promoters upstream to the oncogenes (e.g R-Ras in gastric cancer) thus by activating the oncogenes which could lead a normal cell to a cancerous state.      </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region     (ICR) lies in between the Igf2 and H19 and the enhancer is present     downstream to the H19. In the maternal allele, when the ICR is     unmethylated,  it is bound by an     insulator protein called CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream     enhancer (preferred loop) and now the enhancers acts on H19 (secondary     preferred loop)  to enhance its     expression . In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and prevents     CTCF binding. In absence of CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19     making it silence. Now the enhancer acts on Igf2 (oncogene) by its     preferred loop formation and enhances Igf2 expression. In Wilm’s tumor     which is a childhood renal neoplasm, loss of the H19 /IGF2 imprinted     expression pattern results in silencing of both the allele of H19 and     allows biallelic expression of Igf2. The over expression of Igf2, which is     an oncogene leads to Wilm’s tumor. The other cause of loss of imprinting     might be due to mutation/deletion within the region of methylation where     both alleles behave like paternal one.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyl transferase inhibitors class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine, the drug is a nucleoside analogues and they are incorporated into the DNA during replication and once incorporated they bind irreversibly to the DNMTs and thus preventing the methyl transferase activity which otherwise might have caused hypermythylation and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The anti tumor effect of Decitabine can be visualized by knowing the fact that it has inhibitory effect on DNA methyl transferases. We know that many tumors originate due to the hypermethylation of CpG islands present in the promoters of tumor suppressing genes which makes it silence. Decitabine can block the hypermthylation by deactivating the denovo DNMTs and allowing the expression of tumor suppressor genes.     </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatments because we know once it is laid down can be inherited mitotically with the help of DNMT1 which maintains the methylation status. Sensitive period is the period of human life cycle where clearance of epigenetic marks and resetting of epigenetic marks together called as epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  There are two sensitive periods in human life cycle where epigenetic reprogramming occurs, one from the stage of primordial germ cell development to the formation of mature egg and sperm and the other at the early stage development just after the fertilization including the pre-implantation and post-implantation stage. As mentioned, during the sensitive period, complete epigenetic reprogramming occurs and treating with drugs which can alter the epigenetic status of the genome might disrupt the natural course of resetting the epigenetic marks and might be the cause for disease or syndromes related to faulty epigenetic resetting.   </p></div>
