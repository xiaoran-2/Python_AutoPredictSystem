    <h1>Submission 1475 from Anon (session_user_id: 1ea47b42d829580adc18c951c082befb796f26e2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (used against myelodysplastic syndrome) that gets incorporated to DNA upon replication and when the DNA methyltransferases 1 comes along to bind a nucleotide and copy the methylation to daughter strand, makes it bound irreversibly so it can't be released. As this is a drug that needs DNA replication to have an effect, it will affect cancer cells much more than normal cells, as they replicate more times and more rapidly (however, it lacks specifity, so it will affect the normal cells as well, in a minor way).</p>
<p>In small dosis Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect (in large ones it is toxic), fighting the abnormal growth of cells, and so "killing" the tumour, as they're actually causing DNA methylation in some cases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands remain hypomethyladed, that is, they are not methyladed, as this normally happens in the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the introns of genes. When affected by cancer, however, CpG islands are more likely to be methyladed, so the regions were the process occur are switched. As CpG islands are usually on the promoters of tumour supressor genes, when these islands are hypermethiladed, the promoters of these genes are epigenetically silenced, thus causing the inactivation of the genes, and consequently the development of a tumour. This is one of the process that helps to develop a cancer, and it's very effective (although it is reversible) because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, something that helps the abnormality to spread in its surrounding. It also varies between the different types of tumours, as each of them affect a different set of CpG islands (as well as CpG Islands shores), and it grows over time. </p>
<p>Both intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methyladed in normal cells, are hypomethyladed in cancer cells, and so they have less methylation. When this occurs, you find genomic instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions...) in chromosomes, because the hypomethilation can mantain the dense packaging of DNA in heterochromes. Repetitive elements translocate each other, and also make copies of themselves that jump thorough the genome and activate neighbouring genes, all of this contributing to genome instability. It's something that progresses over time, and they're a general rule for cancer (they do not depend of tumour types, as disrupted methylation in CpG islands). </p>
<p>It is also important to remember that the role of DNA methylation disruption (being it hypermethylation or hypomethilation) always depends on the context you find it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, imprint control regions can be hypermethyladed or hypomethyladed, depending of the region you're looking at and the function of the gens within it. In case of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the normal expression is switched in cancer.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele (CTCF4 is not binding to insulate the imprint control region), and this lets the enhancers to act on lgf2, that is then expressed. In the maternal allele, however, the imprint control region is unmethylated because of CTCF4 bind, an insulator element on the imprint control region that only allows enhancers to act on H19, thus making lgf2 silent (non expressed) on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When it comes to cancer cells, we find hypermethilation also on the imprinted control region of the maternal allele. This hypermethilation makes the enhancers act on lgf2, that is expressed. So in the end, both the paternal and the maternal copies of lgf2 are expressed, and as lgf2 is growth promoting, this is one of the causes of Wilm's tumour, helping the development of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Even after the ending of the drug treatment, effects of altering DNA methylation can last for a long while, as some drugs (as Decitabine studied in last question) affect the cell in its replication phase, thus spreading the effects onto the daughter cells. It epigenetic alterations are heritable in the cells, they will spread thorough the organism even after the ending of the treatment.</p>
<p>This will also happens if drugs take effect on a sensitive period of development. Those are the periods when altered enviorments have an effect on epigenetic control, as the cell is going through epigenetic reprogramming: from primordial cell development to the production of mature sperm eggs; and the pre-implantation and post-implantation period of development.</p>
<p>In these periods it takes place an active remodelling of the epigenome that makes drug treatment inadvisable, because epigenetic modifications that drugs create would spread through the whole genome, causing alterations that may be irreversible, and disrupting the normal epigenetic state of the cell. An alteration in these periods, when the epigenome isn't actually defined, wouldn't be specific, and its consequences would be too enlarged to be good for the organism.</p></div>
