    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (5mC here) was found mostly on CpG in mammalian cells. CpG islands that with a high CpG density and often found on promoters, are protected from methylation in normal cells. The methylation of CpG islands at promoter region would lead to the silencing of gene expression, like during X-inactivation. In cancer, on one hand, some CpG islands in promoters gain DNA methylation, or a regional hypermethylation, thus inactivate some tumor repressor genes and functionally mimic the effect of genetic mutation. On the other hand, some CpG-poor promoters would be hypomethylated, thus activate some oncogenes and functionally mimic the effect of over-expression.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated to guarantee the genomic stability. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, lead to an instable genome. Intergenic regions containing crypic promoters and genes may be transcribed; activated repeats may lead to recombination; both may lead to disease and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Between H19 and Igf2, there is an imprint control region (ICR), which is methylated in paternal and unmethylated in maternal alleles. This ICR, once unmethylated and bound by CTCF (like in maternal allele), would insulate a downstream enhancers’ interaction with Igf2. DNA methylation in this region (like in paternal allele) could on one hand inhibit the CTCF binding, activate the enhancer-Igf2 interaction and enhance the level of Igf2, on the other hand the methylation would spread to the H19 promoter and silence it.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal allele behaves like paternal allele, and therefore methylated. Therefore, Igf2 – an oncogene promoting growth – is activated on two alleles, and lead to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, or DNMT inhibitor, and approved by FDA. It’s a nuceloside analogue, which could “irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA”, and lead to DNA demethylation. This process is replication dependent. Tumor cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, therefore they are more affected. This DNA demethylation effect peaks at low dose, where it’s not quite toxic. Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that may progress to AML.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotic inheritable and may have transgeneration epigenetic inherence. This transgeneration epigenetic inherence is mostly due to sensitive periods. A sensitive period is the temporal sensitive stage of cells, like early development and PGC development. During these two development stages, the DNA methylation of parental genome was decreased and reestablished. If abnormal epigenetic factors affect at this period, such as diet intervention and epigenetic drugs, the normal development for the germ cells of patients would be interfered and may lead to transgeneration epigenetic problems. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
