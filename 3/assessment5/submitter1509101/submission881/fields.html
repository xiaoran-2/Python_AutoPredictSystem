    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands typically exhibit little methylation; they are hypomethylated. In cancer cells, they are more likely to be methylated, leading to CpG island hypermethylation. These islands are generally in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. Cancer therefore inactivates the tumor suppressor in a mitotically heritable way. Cell growth is then inhibited to a lesser degree. As a result, these cells have a competitive advantage, diving more rapidly and being less likely to die. This is one potential insult of the multiple hits required to produce cancer according to Knudson.</p>
<p> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal cells but unmethylated in cancer cells. Hypomethylation of repeats can result in reciprocal translocations because repeats have large similar regions that can align and translocate if they are not methylated and heterochromatinized.  Repeats can be activated by hypomethylation and then transpose or result in the activation of neighboring genes through the activation of cryptic promoters. This can lead to transcriptional errors through deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. Methylation ensures genomic stability and hypomethylation of these regions therefore leads to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells commonly exhibit a loss of imprinting because many imprinted genes are related to growth. Imprint control regions can be hyper-or hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In the example of H19, the imprint control region is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF binds as an insulator and the enhancers act on H19, which is expressed. Igf2 is silent. In the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevents CTCF binding, there is no insulation, and the enhancers can bing to Igf2, which is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, both ICRs are methylated, leading to Igf2 expression in both alleles, which means a higher dose of growth-promoting Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methyl transferase inhibitor. It inserts into the DNA, irreversibly binds to DNMTs, and takes them out of circulation. Decitabine can successfully reverse DNA hypermethylation of promoters and the associated gene silencing. By reducing the genome-wide promoter methylation, it can result in the re-expression of genes such as tumor suppressor genes, which in turn may stop uncontrolled cell growth and the growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation in some way can have long-term effects beyond the period of drug treatment since the DNA methylation status is mitotically heritable. They may lastingly reactivate genes that affect tumor growth and cell death, leading to long term antitumor effects.</p>
<p>Since these drugs act throughout the system rather than specifically on tumor suppressor genes, for instance, adverse effects on other cells are possible. This particularly applies to sensitive periods of development, where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. The two main sensitive periods are early development and (primordial) germ cell development. Any treatment during these sensitive periods may extensively alter the epigenetic profile of cells for the lifetime of the individual and even for subsequent generations, as has been observed for the effects of famine, for instance, during sensitive periods of development.</p></div>
