    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands: </strong></p>
<p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are UNMETHILATED, and in CANCER they are METHILATED.</p>
<p>As you advance in cancer state, you find more methylation in CpG islands, CpG methylation progresses with time, but it can be confused with methylation alterations related to age.</p>
<p>Hypermethilated CGislands varies by tumour type. The effects of this methylation are repression of tumour suppressor genes and loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Some examples of hypermethilation of CpG islands related to cancer are RB in retinoblastoma, MCH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MGMT in glioma and colorectal tumour.</p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation in INTERGENIC REGIONS and REPETITIVE ELEMENTS:</strong></p>
<p>In a normal cell, these elements are METHILATED, but in a cancer cell they use to be UNMETHILATED.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylations) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Is commonly seen in pre-neoplasic tissues.</p>
<p>All these methylations causes GENOMIC INSTABILITY, which in CpG poor promoters can cause oncogene activation.</p>
<p>Effects of GENOMIC INSTABILITY:</p>
<p>-Illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p>-Activation of repeats transposition, of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>We can see all these effects in the genome as <strong>deletions, reciprocal translocations </strong>and<strong> insertions. </strong></p>
<p>Hypomethilation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes, like R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation contributes to cancer:</p>
<p>àHypomethilation genome-wide.</p>
<p>àTumour-supressor hypermethilation.</p>
<p>But DNA methylation is CONTEXT-DEPENDENT and stage specific, for example we can see this effect in the deletion of Dnmt1, that can enhance or suppress tumorogenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of IMPRINTING CONTROL REGIONS is responsible of the loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at Imprinting Control Regions (hypo or hypermethylations) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, and overexpression of growth promoting genes, an example is the HYPERMETHYLATION of the ICR in the Igf2 gene, which is overexpressed in Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>In the PATERNAL allele, the ICR is METHILATED, CTCF doesn’t bind the ICR, and enhancers can activate the expression of Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In the MATERNAL allele, ICR is UNMETHILATED, enhancers act on H19, and Igf2 will be silenced, that will result in NO EXPRESSION of Igf2.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, we will only have expression of the Igf2 gene from the FATHER, not from the MOTHER.</p>
<p>When we have LOSS OF IMPRINTING, like in Wilm’s tumour, what we have is the following:</p>
<p>è We find HYPERMETHILATION of ICR on the MATERNAL allele too, then we also have expression of Igf2, we’ll have DOUBLE DOSE of Igf2 in comparison to what we have in a normal cell.</p>
<p>IGF2 is a growth promoter gene, is associated with Wilm’s tumour (kidney tumour). This is a very early event, we can see it in pre-neoplastic tissues. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of drugs called DNA-demetylating agents, and is used to treat myelodisplastic syndromes (the precursors of myelogenous leukaemia). This drug acts on DNA demethylating it.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase <strong>inhibitor, </strong>is a nucleoside analogue, and it binds DNMTs after they are incorporated to DNA, they are replication dependent. Its mechanism of action at the molecular level is still unclear.</p>
<p>Its effect on tumours may be related to the methylation of CpG islands, because in cancer cells the promoter CpG islands tends to be hypermethilated; and the de-methylation of its promoters may reverse the silencing of the underlying genes implied in these cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. The epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to the daughter cells, and so on until they are actively erased.  That means that if we modify the methylation pattern in any way to kill a cancer cell, and we alter the epigenetic pattern of normal cells (what is very possible, because we administrate the drug to all cells, and it can occur if the drug is not specific), we can alter the methylation pattern of daughter cells for generations.</p>
<p>We need to consider effects on young patients, because of the “sensitive periods”. These are periods of active remodelling of the methylation pattern, like is done on the germ cells, in the early embryo or in the adolescence. This is important, because these modifications might be transmitted to the following generations. We must avoid this periods to treat a patient with that kind of drugs because we can alter the epigenetic machinery not only in the patient, but also in the germ line and we can affect generations of people in the following years after the treatment has finished because of the heritable properties of the epigenetic modifications. </p></div>
