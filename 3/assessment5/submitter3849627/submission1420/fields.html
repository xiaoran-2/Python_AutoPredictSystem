    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is able to be maintained through DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT). CpG Islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation and most retain an unmethylated status. CpG Island methylation can be bound by binding proteins MeCP1 &amp; 2. These can recruit other chromatin condensing factors. Methylated CpG can inhibit transcription factor binding and thus alter gene expresssion. DNA methylation and it's maintainance plays a key role in the silencing of gene expression, so in cancer cells, this CpG island methylation is reversed to that of a normal cell. The CpG Island is<em> hyper</em>methylated, leaving them silent, while the areas such as the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are <em>hypo</em>methylated, meaning they go expressed. This aberrant hypomethylation of tumour suppressor genes can lead to a very broad range of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR on the maternal allele is blocked from methylation by the binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which in turn causes it to be blocked from enhancers, leaving the H19 region open to enhancers for expression while the Igf2 region stays blocked and therefore silent, this action is thought to happen because of chromatin looping. On the paternal allele, CTCF does not bind to the ICR do to ICR methylation, leaving the enhancers free to act on the Igf2 region, leading to Igf2 expression from the paternal allele only. The methylation found at the Imprint Control Region of the paternal allele will most often spread downstream to methylate the paternal H19 promoter. Disruption to imprinting at the Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters at 11q15.5 can result in a loss of Cdknc1 expression (a tumour and growth suppressor) and upregulation of Igf2 (a growth promoting oncogene). In the instance of Beckwith Wiedeman Syndrome, where the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, you see too much Igf2 and no Cdknc1, leading to excessive susceptibility to tumour growth. In this case you often see embryonic and childhood tumours, such as Wilm's tumour in the kidney, but rarely adult tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or Decogen, is a nucleoside analogue incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When DNMT comes along to bind the nucleotides to copy the DNA methylation to the daughter strand, it is irreversibly bound. The action of DNMT inhibitors is cell division dependent, meaning that cancer cells and their rapid cell division are a target for the permanently bound DNMT and will be far more affected. This can help to weaken the tumour and thus make it more susceptible to other therapeutic cancer treatments such as chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA Methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are usually mitotically heritable, epigenetic changes are passed during cell division from daughter cell to granddaughter cell until finally being permanently erased. Because of this, it could be possible that epigenetic cancer therapies could have withstanding results specifically on the cancer cells, potentially leaving the other healthy cells and tissues unharmed. Sensitive periods of development, such as the primordial germ cell development stage (PGC) or the fertalisation period in the development of an embryo, could lead to longer lasting effects from epigenetic drug treatments. However, epigenetic alterations during a sensitive period would be inadvisable as they could result in transgenertaional effects later on due to their susceptibility to environmental and epigenetic changes, and any tampering with the specific stages of development could result in an array of problems.</p></div>
