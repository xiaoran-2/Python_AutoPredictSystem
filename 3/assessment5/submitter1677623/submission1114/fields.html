    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated so methylation is not seen in CpG islands. But the genome is generally methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions, even in the intron regions. In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated (hypermethylation). They are not all methylated but more likely to be methylated than normal cells. The rest of the genome including repetitive elements, intergenic elements are hypomerhylayed. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Cancer cells are able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. It could happen genetically or epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressing gene by locking in acyl in active state. The identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumor type. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, new cells will be DNA methylated and cancer cells will spread. For example; breast cancer is seen if BRCA1 gene is hypermethylated, colorectal cancer is seen if MLH1 gene is hypermethylated. There are also hypermethylated regions surrounding CpG islands. These regions are called CpG island shores. CpG island shores are 2 kb neighboring surrounding CpG islands and these regions tend to hypermethylated in cancer cells. But methylation of CpG island shores can be seen in normal cells.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. For example, the reason of Wilm's tumour is hypermethylation of ICR. It cause to overexpression of Igf2. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p>
<p><span>The DNA methylation inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine can induce functional re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes in cancer, causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. These agents, along with inhibitors of histone deacetylation, have shown clinical activity in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies where gene hypermethylation occurs. <span>Azacitidine and decitabine are clinically active in MDS and other hematologic malignancies and may have therapeutic potential in other malignant disorders. </span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display loss of imprinting. It is not found that hypermethylation of imprint control regions in cancer. In normal cells, a region is methylated on paternal allele while it is not methylated on maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF4 bind is insulator element and it means the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele so expression is not seen. On the paternal allele, enhancers act on Igf2 because CTCF is not bind to insulate this. Igf2 is expressed from paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour paternal and maternal allele is methylated and Igf2 is expressed on maternal and paternal allele. Thus, there is double expression of Igf2. Igf2 is both growth promoting and it is associated with Wilm's tumour. This is a particular childhood kidney tumour that is observed. Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumour types. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation act to regulate gene expression in normal mammalian development. However, promoter hypermethylation also plays a major role in cancer through transcriptional silencing of critical growth regulators such as tumor suppressor genes. <span>Treatment with inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can reactivate epigenetically silenced genes and has been shown to restore normal gene function. In cancer cells, this results in expression of tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory functions, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis. </span></span></p>
<p>There are two reprogramming windows. The primordial development and germ cell development and early embryonic development are really sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming. </p></div>
