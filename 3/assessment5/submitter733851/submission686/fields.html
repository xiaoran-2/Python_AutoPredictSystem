    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are short DNA sequences different from the average genomic pattern. These sequences are CG-rich and normally <span>nonmethylated. </span></span>Most of them are sites of transcription initiation, thus silencing promoters in this region of the DNA through CpG methylation is important to gene activity regulation. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors. In carcinogenesis, epigenetic <span>disrupted </span>mechanisms that regulate gene expression result in hypermethylation of CpG islands, in a way that tumor suppressor genes do not repond to normal stimuli. Recently global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. Generally the genome is methylated in the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and hypomethylated at CpG island. <span>DNA methylation usually refers to downregulation of transcriptional processes, avoiding harmful consequences once it can prevent transcription from happening in places where it should not occur (<span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements)</span>. Transcription still happens through <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</span> however at a much lower rate than it would otherwise when there is no disruption in the process. <span>The nonspecific transcription is </span><span>a waste of time and energy (resources in the cell are limited)</span><br /><span>and it can be potentially harmful if disrupted transcription leads to downregulation of a gene by RNAi pathways.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a process by which there is favored expression of a specific parental allele depending on its origin either materna or paternal. Loss of imprinting is a known feature of tumour cells. In such cases instead of monoallelic expression theses cells show parental alleles that are silent from both parents. One of the ways one could explain this fact is that these imprinted genes are somehow involved in promoting or supressing growth. IGF2 is methylated on the paternal allele (the enhancers act on IGF2) but it is unmethylated on the maternal allele (the enhancers act on H19). If there is a loss of imprinting it will lead to expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele as well displaying a double dose of it.This is what happens in Wilm's tumour, a condition based on this <span>aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternal allele.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a </span>DNA-demethylating agent. The <span>antineoplastic effect of this drug is based on direct incorporation into DNA, it inhibits DNA methyltransferase which cause hypomethylation of the DNA then cellular differentiation or apoptosis. <span>The hypomethylation state induced by the drug acts to reestablish the normal function to genes that related to the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable then it is displayed in daughter and granddaughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span>The sensitive period correspond to <span>periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. </span></span>Tthere are to main waves of epigenetic reprogramming that take place - the germ cell development and early development. Treating patients during this period might disrupt these reprogramming processes by altering the environment in which they happen; alteration during the sensitive periods could have severe consequences for how efficiently the reprogramming occurs. </p></div>
