    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a mechanism of gene expression control. Imprinted genes are often important for the growth regulation. Expression of imprinted genes is commonly disrupted in cancer cells. Both paternal and maternal copies of the imprinted gene can be silenced or kept active.  Imprinted control regions can be either hypermethylated or hypomethylated Expression from Igf2/H19 cluster is controlled in a parent dependent manner,  With Igf2 expressed from paternal allele only. However, disruption of methylation of the imprint control region on the maternal copy of the cluster  (hypermethylation of ICR prevents binding of PRC2 complex giving access to the downstream  enhancer )  can lead to inappriate expression of Igf2, resulting in  double the amount of the gene product. Consequently, too much expression  from inappropriately activated parental copy of the gene might severally affect cellular proliferation leading to Wilm's tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved DNA-demethylating agent used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. It belongs to a group of cytidine nucleoside analogs. If incorporated into DNA , this agent leads to inhibition of methyltransferases and consecuently demethylaton of DNA sequence.  This drug primarily affects deviding cells, hence it can target rapidly prolifirating tumour cells. The exact mechanims of action of decitabine have not been fully characterised and seems to depend on the dose of the drug: with inhibition of cellular proliferation at higher concerntratration (possibly due to its toxicity) and reactivation of tumour suppressor genes at lower conentration of the drug. Decitabine is well tolerated with fewer side-affects than compared to conventional cancer treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The lasting effect of epigenetic drugs on tumour cells can be explained by maintenance of DNA methylation  pattern in the cell lineage. Once a drug has been applied and DNA methylation status was changed, the pattern of methylation is maintained in the subsequent cellular divisions. However, during certain periods in mammalian development the epigenetic signiture of the cells is reset. These periods of epigenetic reprogramming are particularly sensitive to environmental insults, which potentially can have transgenerational consequences.  One such period takes place during early preimplantation development, just after fertilisation when maternal and paternal pronuclei undergo demethylation, however imprinted genes are not reset at this time.  Then, later in germ cell development imprinted marks are erased and a new pattern is re-established according to the parental origin. This second period of reprogramming is particularly susceptible to external impact. Treating patients with epigenetic anti-cancer drugs should be avoided during these sensitive periods. A special care can be taken to maintain unaffected by treatment germ cells for preservation patient's fertility. &lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--&gt;</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In cancer development, deregulation of epigenetic control plays an important role alongside genetic alterations. Function of DNA methylation can be defind by the DNA sequence context. Thus, DNA methylation of gene promotors is generally associated with gene silencing. However, CpG islands found within many promoter sequences are often unmethylated irrespective of whether the corresponding gene is active or silenced. However, in cancer, methylation of CpG islands can be frequently observed leading to gene inactivation. Gene repair systems and detection of gene mutations can be inactivated in this manner in a cancer cell.&lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--&gt;</span></p>
<p><span> In contrast, overall genome of a cancer cell is hypomethylated. Methylation of intragenic regions in a healthy cell plays a number of roles guarding genome stability. Thus, methylation of repetitive elements does not allow paring of the similar genetic sequences on different chromosomes that can otherwise lead to translocations during cell divisions.  DNA methylation also has an important role in transposone silencing, reactivation of transposons as a reslt of DNA methylation loss can further promote genetic rearrangements in the tumour cells. Hypomethylation of introns can lead to reactivation of silent promoters. Overall hypomethylation of intragenic sequences can accelerate accumulation of genetic abnormalities in a tumour cell and promote deregulation of gene expression.</span></p>
