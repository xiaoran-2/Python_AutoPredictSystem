    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark with an important role in regulation of gene expression. It occurs most commonly at CpG dinucleotides and is mitotically heritable due to the function of DMNT1. CpG dinucleotides are normally clustered at gene promoters forming CpG islands. As long as these CpG islands are methylated, the gene is inactive or silenced - this occurs via the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Hence, when CpG islands at gene promoters are not methylated the gene is active.</p>
<p>Abnormal DNA methylation at CpG islands is often found in cancer in the form of hypermethylation. This can occur at tumour suppressor genes which normally limit growth. If they are hypermethylated, they are silenced and cancer can grow indefinitely. This is commonly seen in cancer because such alterations of the DNA are mitotically heritable, rapidly selected for and represent an alternative to genetic mutation. Hypermethylation of sets of CpG islands at different genes is also seen in cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements throughout the genome are usually methylated which maintains genome stability by preventing mutagenic processes, transposition and even illegitimate recombination. Genome-wide hypomethylation was the first abnormality found in cancer and it occurs very often. This results in genomic instability, e.g. activation of repeats and transposition or illegitimate recombination. In addition, oncogenes are genes which promote growth and these can be inappropriately activated due to CpG island hypomethylation allowing the cancer to grow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is vital to genome stability. The H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted via enhancer blocking at an imprinting control region (ICR). In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and the protein CTCF binds to it, enhancers then activate the H19 gene which is downstream of the ICR. Hence, in the maternal allele the H19 gene is active whilst the Igf2 gene is silenced. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the CTCF protein can't bind to it, the H19 gene is methylated, i.e. silenced, and the enhancers help in the expression of Igf2. In the paternal allele H19 is silenced and Igf2 is active.</p>
<p>Aberrant gene expression due to imprinting abnormalities is a common cause of tumours. Wilms' tumour, e.g., is a childhood tumour which results from the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele, i.e. there is a loss of imprinting at the maternal allele and there is two times more Igf2 expressed than there should be. Imprinting disruptions of this cluster are problematic since Igf2 promotes growth and if there is more of it in the body, a tumour can easily arise. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, i.e. it reduces the amount of DNA methylation in the genome. DNA hypermethylation is a feature in many cancers which leads to genomic instability, so Decitabine, e.g., can be used in attempt to stabilise the genome by lowering DNA methylation levels. In cancer, tumour suppressor genes which limit growth are often hypermethylated and silenced but a demethylating drug can lead to their reactivation, i.e. DNA demethylation can result in suppression of growth of the cancer and thus such drugs can have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and it is sustained throughout development. However, there are sensitive periods when DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks are re-established. A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are removed from the DNA and then are established again. There are two sensitive periods - primordial germ cell development and early development. It would not be advisable to treat patients during these periods since that would be likely to influence not only the epigenetic marks underlying cancer development but also those underlying normal development. If the latter are compromised, this would have a huge negative effect on the patient.</p></div>
