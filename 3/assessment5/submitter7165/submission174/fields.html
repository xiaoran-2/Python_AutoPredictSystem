    <div class="field-value"><p>     In its simplest description, cancer cell growth is due to the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.  These activation and inactivation processes can be achieved either genetically or epigenetically.  In the case of epigenetic-based cancer cell growth, it has been discovered that the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is often due to higher than average or hyper-methylation of CpG islands and their neighboring 2kb shores in the promoter of these genes and lower than average or hypo-methylation of the DNA in the inter-genic and repetitive elements of these genes.  In a normal cell, the CpG islands and shores are relatively un-methylated and the inter-genic and repetitive element regions are heavily methylated.  The former allows for normal transcription of the tumor suppressor gene and the latter promotes genomic stability of the gene. The consequence of the hyper-methylation in the CpG islands and neighboring shores in the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene in cancer cells is to disable transcription of this gene, which can allow for unrestricted growth of the cell, leading to tumor production and disease.  In addition, the lack of methylation in the inter-genic and repetitive elements of the gene in cancer cells can lead to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, which can result in re-insertion, deletion, or translocation of parts of the chromosome during recombination or otherwise, resulting in the further potential for disease.  Unfortunately for the cancer patient, the DNA methylation problems are mitotically inheritable.  But, fortunately, compared to genetic mutations, the epi-mutations are reversible and can provide a possible mechanism for successful cancer treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     Variations in DNA methylation (either hyper or hypo) at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) are often found in cancer cells since these changes can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.  This variation is commonly seen in early pre-tumorous tissue.  In the specific case of the normal operation of the imprinted H19/Igf2 gene cluster, methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele does not allow the binding of CTCF, which suppresses the expression of H19, and leads to expression of the growth factor Igf2.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is un-methylated and so CTCF binds and promotes the transcription of H19, which suppresses the expression of Igf2.  In a cancer cell, the ICR in the maternal allele is hyper-methylated, leading to a lack of binding of CTCF, which suppresses the expression of H19, and results in the expression of Igf2, just as in the normal parental allele.  This resulting “double dose” of the growth factor Igf2 due to the hyper-methylation of the ICR in the maternal allele leads to the development of a childhood kidney tumor disease known as Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  The epigenetic drug Decitabine, which is sold as Dacogen by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Eisai, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent which hypo-methylates DNA by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).   Many cancers of the immune system are due to mutations that make DNMTs, such as EZH2, overactive.  This overactivity causes hyper-methlyation of histone proteins which can result in the silencing of the genes that they surround.  These genes can include tumor suppressor genes whose function is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.  Decitabine therefore has an anti-tumor effect by inhibiting the hyper-methylation activitiy of DNMTs, which allows normal regulation of cell growth by tumor suppressing genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   The effect of DNA de-methylation by drugs like azacitidine and decitabine, unlike other forms of gene regulation, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells (mitotically inheritable) and may last well beyond the treatment phase.  The relative stability of this state of DNA methylation is a very positive aspect of epigenetic therapies since the side effects of treatment may be minimized and in this case only cells which are hyper-methylated (cancerous cells) are affected.  However, there are two sensitive periods for epigenetic effects in the cell cycle in which epigenetic marks are cleared between generations in order to restore totipotency.  During the primordial germ cell development and in early embryonic development, the paternal genome is rapidly and actively de-methylated and the maternal genome is passively de-methylated.  Epigenetic drug treatment during these sensitive periods of high epigenetic activity could lead to unstable and unreliable treatment results.</p></div>
