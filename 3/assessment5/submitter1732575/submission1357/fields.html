    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of specific DNA regions results to varying outcomes depending on which DNA regions are methylated and the degree of such methylation. In non-cancer, normal cells, CpG islands located primarily in promoter regions are hypomethyled allowing transcription of the corresponding gene such as the tumor suppressor genes. However, in cancer cells, these CpG islands are hypermethylated, thereby, silencing these tumor suppressor genes leading to cancer initiation and/or progression. Such CpG island hypermethylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>DNA of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is hypermethylated in normal cells to maintain genome stabilitiy. In these normal cells, intergenic regions are hypermethylated to silence cryptic promoters, alternative transcription start sites and alternative splice sites within the gene in order to express a normal, functional gene product. Repetitive elements such as those found in satellite regions, LINES and SINES are also hypermethylated in normal cells to silence these repetitive regions preventing transposition mutations, to avoid transcriptional interference brought about by a stronger promoter and to prevent any illegitimate DNA recombination or translocations within the genome.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these repetitive elements are hypomethylated allowing genome instability to occur leading to illegitimate recombination or transpositions between DNA regions, activation of these repetitive sequences and activation of alternative promoters and splice junctions resulting to disruption of normal gene function, activation of oncogenes or production of non-functional transcription products that could lead to cancer. For instance, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of certain genes such as R-Ras associated with gastric cancer and miRNA-21 that activate PTEN found in glioma cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Certain DNA clusters could be imprinted depending from which parental gamete the allele originated. In the IGF2/H19 cluster, this parent-of-origin-dependent expression results to the differential expression of the IGF2 gene that is inhibited by the H19 gene product downstream of the IGF2 gene. </span></p>
<p><span>In the paternally-inherited allele, both the imprint control region (ICR) and the promoter of the H19 gene are hypermethylated preventing the CTCF insulator protein to bind to the ICR. Hypermethylation of the ICR region spreads to the nearby H19 promoter silencing H19 transcription allowing enhancers downstream of the H19 gene to activate the fetal growth factor IGF2 gene. </span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, in the maternally-inherited allele, the ICR and the H19 promoter are unmethylated. The CTCF insulator protein is now able to bind to the unmethylated ICR allowing the downstream enhancers to activate H19 transcription repressing IGF2 expression.</span></p>
<p><span>In pediatric kidney Wilm’s tumors, both parental alleles have hypermethylated ICR and H19 promoters leading to the silencing of H19 RNA transcription akin to the paternal-origin expression in normal cells. Such hypermethylation of the ICR and H19 promoters lead to the biallelic IGF2 gene expression enhancing Wilm’s tumor tumorgenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The FDA-approved drug decitabine (Dacogen, Eisai) is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA subsequently inhibiting DNMT1. Following the analogue’s incorporation into the genome DNA during S-phase, DNMT1 is irreversibly bound to the analogue blocking DNMT's methyltransferase function resulting to heritably demethylated DNA passed on to daughter cells. This DNMT1 binding also triggers the initiation of the degradation pathway of DNMT1, thus, controlling DNMT enzyme levels.</p>
<p>Decreasing levels of these DNMT1's lead to decreasing the hypermethylation in the genome by both decreasing the enzyme’s levels and activity. Decreasing these hypermethylation states would lead to enhanced gene silencing like for cancer-associated genes restoring proper control over cell proliferation and sensitivity to apoptosis. Thus, decreasing tumorgenesis such as found in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a pre-leukemic bone marrow disorder, and lung cancers wherein decitabine is used.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs specifically targeting methylation marks have enduring effects are these marks are mitotically-heritable. Once DNMT3a or 3b methylates the cytosine residue in a CpG island, DNMT1 recognizes this hemi-methylated DNA strand and methylates the cytosine residue of the CpG island on the complementary, daughter strand allowing this new epigenetic mark to be mitotically passed to daughter cells.</p>
<p>The pre-implantation stage and the primordial germ cell (PGC) periods are epigenetically-sensitive as these are the times wherein epigenetic mark changes are more frequent. At the pre-implantation stage, the paternal genome is silenced while the maternal epigenome is reset while new epigenetic marks are consistently removed, laid down and maintained during the PGC period.</p>
<p>Drugs that target the epigenome would have immense effects if given during these sensitive periods. Changes in the epigenetic marks could result in hypermethylation of the CpG islands activating oncogenes or the biallelic expression of gene cassettes such as the IGF/H19 cluster; or, in hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, repetitive elements or intergenic regions repressing tumor suppressor genes or leading to genome instability. These epigenetic mark changes may be mitotically-inherited and probably lead to increase cancer initiation and/or progression.</p>
