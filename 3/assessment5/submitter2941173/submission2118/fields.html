    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found near the promoter of several genes. Methylation of these CpG islands causes the gene to be transcriptionally repressed.</p>
<p>In cancer there is hypermethylation of CpG islands that are unmethylated in the normal tissue.</p>
<p>Most of hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer involve the promoter of tumor suppressor genes, misregulating cell growth and behaviour and leading to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elemnts can have different effects:</p>
<p>- suppresses the expression of transposable elements (TE) that have been shown to lead to genome instability</p>
<p>- silences cryptic promoters found in intronic and intergenic regions that might lead to expression of truncated and therefore possibly patogenic proteins or misregulate the expression of ncRNAs.</p>
<p>In cancer the DNA of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is whidely hypomethylated. This leads to expression of TEs with consequent genome instability and misregulation of genes found nearby, to the expression of non-functional proteins and to the misregulation of ncRNAs expression. All these effects can lead to cell transformation an disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated. The methylation also spreads to the promoter region of the H19 gene (downstream of the ICR) repressing its expression. These settings let the enhancer present downstream of H19 to stimulate expression of the Igf2 gene that is upstream of the ICR. As a consequence the paternal Igf2 gene is expressed and the paternal H19 is not.</p>
<p>In the mathernal allele the ICR and the H19 promoter are unmethylated. The insulator CTCF interacts with the unmethylated ICR and blocks the action of the downstream enhancer on the Igf2 gene. Instead, the enhancer stimulates the expression of the H19 gene. As a consequence the maternal H19 is expressed and the maternal Igf2 is not.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated in both paternal and maternal allele. Both behave as the paternal allele normally does, therefore there is overexpression of the Igf2 gene and downregulatoin of H19 expression. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene; its overexpression stimulates cell growth and proliferation increasing the possibility of cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine induces demethylation of the DNA by inactivating DNA methyl-transferases (DNMTs); being a nucleotide analog it is incorporated into the DNA upon DNA replication and iteracts unreversably with DNMTs.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes is a common feature in many tumors. By causing DNA demethylation of these promoters, Decitabine activates them and therefore the tumor suppressor genes can be transcribed, reducing the spreading and development of the tumor. At high concentrations Decitabine is also citotoxic since it hampers DNA repliction causing cell death. Since cancer cells are the mostly dividing cells in the organism this cytotoxic action affects mainly the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable thanks to the action of DNMT1 that methylates the newly sintethized strand using the old one as a template to recognize the previusly methylated loci.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are established and it has been shown to be sensitive to environmental factors.</p>
<p>During development there are two main sensitive preiods:  DNA methylation is completely erased in the embryo before implantation (with the exception of imprinted genes) and during primordian germ cells development, when imprinting marks are established.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive preriods might interfere with the establishment of the normal epigenetic marks (such as the methylation of imprinted genes) causing altered gene expression and chromatin structure in the adult and possibly in his/her offspring.</p></div>
