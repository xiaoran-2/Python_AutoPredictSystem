    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer patients, DNA methylation is very different to that of normal cells. Normally, CpG islands surround promoters of genes and are protected from methylation, as this silences the gene. In cancer, these CpG islands are much more likely to be methylated (they are said to be hypermethylated) and the more developed the cancer is, the more hypermethylated the CpG islands. Which CpG islands are hypermethylated depends on the type of cancer. The CpG islands that are found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes are especially likely to become methylated in cancers, as this will silence the tumor suppressor genes, so tumors are more able to form. Because this hypermethylation is mitotically heritable, it is a very effective way of silencing the tumor suppressor genes, and gives the cells containing this hypermethylated DNA a competitive edge to be able to divide more rapidly, die less frequently, and eventually take over parts of the tissue. This can therefore lead to the development of a cancer which is primarily driven by the lack of tumor suppressors, and increase the likelihood of metastasis.</p>
<p>In contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are normally methylated and heterochromatinised, which means they are genomically stable. In cancers, these regions are less likely to be methylated- they are said to be hypomethylated. This is especially common in the repetitive elements. As with hypermethylation of CpG islands, the more developed the cancer is, the more hypomethlated these regions are, but intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in all cancers. This hypomethylation allows for illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements of the genome, such as reciprocal translocations, insertions, deletions and translocations, which enhances tumorigenesis in cancers which are primarily driven by genomic instability (a hallmark of cancer), hence contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor agent, which is a Nucleoside Analogue drug. This means that it reduces DNA methylation, and so can reduce the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoter regions. It can do this because it is incorporated into the DNA, where it can then irreversibly bind DNMTs, so DNA methylation cannot be maintained when the cells divide, as there is no DNMT to methylate hemimethylated DNA, and so the amount of methylation of the DNA is diluted down. Because of this, Decitabine is replication dependant, which also means it affects cancer cells more than normal cells, as cancer cells are dividing more rapidly. This means that tumors are more suppressed as the tumor suppressor genes become active, and so Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, altering it can have enduring effects on the genome. When methylated DNA is replicated, the daughter strands are methylated by DNMT1 proteins. Therefore, once DNA methylation is altered by a drug, this drug will have affected the amount of DNA methylation beyond the duration of treatment. There are periods of development where you would avoid using these sorts of drugs; sensitive periods. A sensitive period is defined as a period of development when the environment has the greatest influence on the epigenome- the periods when the epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. These sensitive periods of development include primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation period. Therefore, if a female patient was treated with a drug which altered DNA meythlation whilst carrying an embryo which was in these stages of development, the drug would also effectively be given to the embryo, and would affect the methylation of its DNA, and the DNA of the embryo's developing germ cells. As DNA methylation is vital, this could have negative consequences for both the developing embryo and the generation after that, and we don't know how these drugs will affect patients over time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprint Control Region (ICR) of the H19/lgf2 cluster is not methylated on the maternal allele. This means that CTCF, an insulator protein, is able to bind to the ICR, and so promoters cannot access the lgf2. This means the lgf2 is unable to be expressed on the maternal allele- it is maternally imprinted. However, on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and so the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to it. The promoters can access the lgf2 gene, and therefore it is expressed. Where imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted, and the maternal allele is no longer imprinted, a Wilm's tumor can develop. In this tumor, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele and, as a result, also expresses the lgf2 gene, so there is far too much expression of lgf2. This can occur due to uniparental disomy, a genetic mutation or deletion, or a disruption to the epigenome. As lgf2 is an oncogene and a promoter of growth, higher levels of expression promote tumorogenesis, and lead to the development of the cancer.</p></div>
