    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, majority of CpG islands and genes promoters are non-methylated and genes are active. Cancer changes methylation profile of the cells, hypermethylating CpG islands. Such genes as Rb, MLH1 etc. become hypermethylated and their activity is blocked, provoking cells to uncontrolled cell division and metastasis. From the other side, level of hypermethylation (CIMP) is a good prognostic marker. For example, if MLH1 is hypermethylated in patients with colorectal cancer, it could mean good outcome, as this process is reversible and treatable.</p>
<p>Regarding intergenic and repetitive elements, they are silenced and hypermethylated in normal cells. One of the general features of the cancer cells that methylation their repetitive elements and intergenic regions are disrupted and hypomethylated. It causes genomic instability and as consequence illegitimate recombination of chromsome with disease marks accumulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, paternal allele of H19 is methylated while maternal allele is non-methylated. It gives expression of Igf2 from paternal gene only and thus regulated by imprinting. Alteration in methylation of H19/Igf2 cluster (hypermethylation of ICRs) results disactivation of H19 promotor, cahnges in enhancing of CTGF regulator protein and overexpression of Igf2 protein which causes uncontrolled growth promotion of kidney and Wilm's tumour in kids.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a deoxycytidine analogue and a hypomethylating agent. It is more stable and less toxic than azacitidine, classic DNA-demethylating agent. It belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, lowering methylation status in cell through binding with DNMTs and thus activating necessary for cell homeostasis proteins. Among negative effects of its influence - that its impact isn't selective for cancer cells only; moreover, it affects all methylated normal genes as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of genome is tightly controlled mechanism, with definite methylated and non-methylated regions. This process is reversible among development and during life. Enviorement, life style, heredity, stress and much more can accumulate mutations and alterations on epigenetic level. All that could have negative effect on organism in whole and cause disease. There are some sensitive periods during organism development, when epigenetic changes are more critical and resuts more dramatic effect on organism. They are X-chromosome inactivation/deactivation, when imprinting machinery is regulated and all pre-natal period, as DNA methylation status of organism is setting. The second important period is a puberty, when new gamets are mature, programming healt of future generations. Of course, epigenetic treating in this periods could be inadvisable, because methylation/demethylation processes are very complicated with un-undersatanding control mechanism that is very simply to break. Aftermath could be significant and irreversible for organism.</p></div>
