    <h1>Submission 506 from Anon (session_user_id: 384fa6a60f619c9bd3e8c6cd2e17dd0c074e3bf9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, which decreases DNA-methylation globely. <span> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </span> </p>
<p><span>Phase II trials have reported substantial clinical activity of decitabine in the myelodysplastic syndrome and in chronic myelogenous leukemia. There is considerable interest in combining decitabine with histone deacetylase inhibitors and in using it to sensitize cells to chemotherapy or to biologic therapy. Finally, ongoing efforts are deciphering the </span><em>in vivo</em><span> mechanisms of responses seen after decitabine administration. One of the mechanisms is via decreased DNA-methylation in the CpG island in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in higher expression of the tumor suppressor genes. High expression of tumor suppressor genes have an anti-tumor effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alteration can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This is because that DNA methylation profile is passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaugher cells until they are actively erased. Maintenance<span> methyltransferase</span> DNMT1 <span>in mammalian cells</span> plays a key role in ensuring that the daugher cells inherit the DNA methylation profile from the parent cells duing cell division.</p>
<p>However, there are senstive periods when the epigenetic profiles are reprogrammed. During these periods, the epigettic marks are actively removed.</p>
<p><span><span>Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs at stages when developmental potency of cells changes. </span>Epigenetic modifications undergo reprogramming during the life cycle in two phases: during gametogenesis <span>and preimplantation development.</span></span></p>
<p>Treating patients during these reprogramming periods (sensitive periods) would be inadvisable, because epigenetic modifications made by the drug treatment would be erased. Therefore, the drug effects would become short-lived instead of long-lived.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the addition of methy group to the C5 postion of the cytocine. T<span>he function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context. </span></p>
<p>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.  CpG islands, which have high CpG density compared to the genom-wide distribution, are found in about 60% of promoters. In most instances, the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated if the genes are expressed. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying genes, such as tumor suppressor genes - controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. </p>
<p><span>Methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA, <span>suppresses the unwanted expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), alternative intragenic promoters and the expression of repetitive elements  such as retroviruses, LINE1 elements, Alu elements and others ,  to reduce genomic instability. </span></span> Frequently expressed genes would have higher levels of gene body methylation in order to reduce the chance of aberrant ncRNAs being expressed or alternative intragenic promoters being active,while at the same time allowing transcription of the host gene to run through them.  </p>
<p>In cancers, repetitive elements are hypomehylated, leading to expression of repetitive elements, premature ending of transcripts and expression of unwanted ncRNAs, which results in genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTCF s an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR (imprint control region) in paternal allele blocks binding of CTCF of paternal allele. Without binding of CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoters to silence H19 and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate paternal Igf2 allele.</p>
<p>Without DNA methylation at ICR in maternal allele in H19 promoter, CTCF binds to ICR successfully, which blocks the enhaners to access maternal Igf2  allele, therefore inactivate maternal Igf2 allele.</p>
<p>Therefore, normally, only paternal Igf2 is expressed to maintain normal growth.</p>
<p>In imprinted disorders such as Wilm's tumor, various abnormalities occur in linked H19/Igf2 clusters. When methylation occurs at ICR of both maternal and paternal allele, CTCF fails to bind to either maternal or paternal ICR, resulting in activation of Igf2 in both maternal and paternal allele, and increased expression of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene, which promotes growth. Elevated expression of Igf2 contributes to the disease.</p></div>
