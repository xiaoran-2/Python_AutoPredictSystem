    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at the promoter regions of genes. Methylation of these islands have been found to be associated with a silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>What is found in cancer is that there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands (and CpG island shores) of certain genes (like tumor suppressing genes) - in contrast with normal cells where they are not.</p>
<p>When the CpG island of tumor suppressing genes is methylated, this results in the silencing of these genes which normally would protect the organism from uncontrolled proliferation of cells. With these genes rendered unable, the cancer can form and spread unchecked. (Contributing to this problem is the fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which means all the daughter cells will carry on the same methylation as the parent cell.)</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions is found to be associated with genome stability. DNA methylation of repetitive elements is also necessary to maintain genomic integrity. DNA         methylation at these regions helps prevent chromosomal deletion, insertion, duplication, and translocation. It also helps prevent repetitive elements from jumping around in the genome which could potentially introduce mutations in important genes.</p>
<p>What is found in cancer is that there is a genome wide hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements (in contrast with healthy cells where these areas are normally methylated).</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at these sites create genomic instability. Loosing the methyl groups in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements allows these sites to participate in illegitimate         recombinations (due to their similarity to each other) which results in chromosomal deletion, insertion, duplication, and translocation. This 'reshuffling' of chromosomes could lead to loss of certain genes and overexpression of other genes, any of which could be highly detrimental to the organism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and this blocks binding of the CTCF insulator protein to it. The absence of this protein allows the downstream enhancers to access and activate lgf2 and so it is expressed. (The absence of the CTCF insulator protein also results in the methylation spreading to the H19 promoter silencing it.)</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is not methylated and this allows the binding of the CTCF insulator protein to it. The presence of this protein blocks the downstream enhancers to access and activate lgf2 and so it is not expressed. (The presence of the CTCF insulator protein also results in the activation and expression of H19.)  </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor a case of hypermethylation is found, where the ICR is methylated not only the paternal allele, but also on the maternal allele. This results in overexpression (double dose) of the lgf2 gene.</p>
<p>Methylation of both the paternal and maternal ICRs results in an overexpression (double dose) of the lgf2 gene. This gene is a growth promoting gene and it contributes to unchecked growth and proliferation of the cell which is what's seen in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation: since it is a DNA-demethylating agent, the effect will be a lessening of methylation over the DNA strand.</p>
<p>How Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect: in many cancers, tumor-suppressing genes are silenced by hyper-methylation of CpG islands. Decitabine removes this methylation (by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase) which results in the re-activation of the tumor suppressing genes, which then allows the body to gain control once again over tumor genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>How altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome:</p>
<p>        DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore any epigenetic changes created in a cell will be passed down to the daughter and granddaughter cells and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Define what is meant by a sensitive period:</p>
<p>        It is a time in the life of the organism when epigenetic reprogramming is happening; epigenetic marks are being erased, then re-established once again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Identify sensitive periods of development:</p>
<p>        One of the sensitive periods is during early development (pre-implantation period), the other one is during germ cell development. During these times, the existing epigenetic marks are removed and then get re-established once again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable:</p>
<p>        Treating during the sensitive periods can permanently change the epigenetic marks of the organisms which will then be passed onto the following generations of cells. Interference with the normal reprogramming mechanism could result in hypo- or hyper-methylation, and both of these conditions are associated with disease.</p></div>
