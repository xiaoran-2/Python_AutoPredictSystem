    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely related with gene expression. DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of associated gene. If it is highly methylated, relevant gene is not expressed and vice versa.</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated which results in the inactivaton of that associated gene, like in case of tumor suppressor genes. For proto oncogenes, CpG islands become hypomethylated. </li>
<li>If intensive DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes takes place at their CpG islands, then they become inactive and cannot control the abnormal growth of tumor. While DNA hypomethylation of proto oncogenes is associated with their high expression which consequently promotes over growth of cancer cells.</li>
<li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes their silencing. </li>
<li><span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in a way that they are hypomethylated which results in overexpression of these regions. </span></li>
<li><span><span>disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to diseases by some mechanisms notably chromosomal translocations. Abnormal DNA methylation patterns makes changes (relatively open chromatin) in chromosomal architecture in a way that illegitimate recombinations between repeats are favored. </span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Paternal allele: imprinted control region is methylated and insulator CTCF is not bound. this allows enhancers to act on<em> igf2</em> but not on H19. so <em>igf2</em> is expressed. </li>
<li>Maternal allele: imprinted control region is not methylated and CTCF is bound. enhancers act on H19 and express it while <em> igf2</em> is not expressed. </li>
<li>Wilm's tumor: both alleles are methylated and there is no CTCF bound. as a result enhancers act on<em> igf2</em> but not on H19. so <em>igf2</em> is expressed is double expressed.</li>
<li>igf is growth promoting and contributes to disease when over expressed.  </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, which means this class of drugs can remove methyl groups from DNA or it may inhibit DNA methylation.</li>
<li>Decitabine can remove methyl groups from DNA or it may simply inhibit DNA methylation. In other words, DNA is hypomethylated by Decitabine.</li>
<li>Decitabine is believed to exert its anti-tumor effects by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as the methylation pattern of all cells can be affected. As DNA methylation like other epigenetic marks is reversible, it can be sustained there and cause silencing. </li>
<li>The time period when subjects are more prone to responding environmental influences is the sensitive period. </li>
<li>Early development (pre-implantation period) and Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) development are main sensitive periods. Post natal development can also be considered sensitive period of development</li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods could have long lasting effects. even if that patient is not affected directly then subsequent generations may show the effects latter in their life span. </li>
