    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is at a lower level in a normal (not-cancer) cell. As the cancer progresses, since the normal cell to the invasion, through the hyperplasia and neoplasia, the DNA methylation at CpG islands is increasing.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer, so in a normal cell the hipomethylation is the normal state of the CpG islands.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypermethylation at CpG islands. The hypermethylation progresses till the higher level at the invasion state of the cancer.</p>
<p>CpG islands hypermethylation progresses with time in cancer (and with age too in normal cells). The CpG shores hypermethylated (2 kb around the CpG islands) are an important part of the cancer process too.</p>
<p> Related to disease, there are several genes involved in different types of cancer that are hypermethylated at CpG islands. For instance, RB in the retinoblastoma (eye cancer) or BCRA 1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Each of these genes can be used as biomarker. In the same way could be used sets of CpG islands. With a panel of biomarkers, the sensitivity of the detection is increased, which is extremely important for the diagnosis, the prognosis and the treatment and monitoring of the different tumours.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is at a high level of methylation (hipermethylation). As the cancer progresses, the hipomethylation of the genome-wide DNA is the primordial process. It occurs to some degree in all tumour types tested, and progresses with tumorigenicity (like CGI hypermethylation).</p>
<p>The hipomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements depends on location and it is very common. It is due to the genomic instability that causes illegitimate recombination between repeats that leads to the cancer situation: Deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions.</p>
<p>Evidences of the hipomethylation linked to disease are shown in Dnmt1 mouse models or ICF syndrome in human disease. In both cases, the genomic instability is a characterisc feature of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. The hypermethylation of ICR and the oncogene Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour is an example of this (kidney tumour; childhood tumour).</p>
<p>Paternal allele: The insulator protein CTCF is hypermethylated and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. H19 promotor is hypermethylated too, so it blocks the enhancers activates Igf2 and leads to the silencing of the allele and the expression of the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Maternal allele: The CTCF protein is blocked by the DNA methylation at ICR, so the enhancers activate the H19 promotor allowing the normal expression of the gene and the normal process of the imprinting.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour there is hypermethylation of ICR and Igf2 overexpression. Both alleles, paternal and maternal are hypermethylated at the CTFC protein and the H19 promotor, so the imprinting is loss (common feature of cancer).</p>
<p>This imprinting disorder (H19/Igf2 cluster) is linked to disease through the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, caused by the maternal allele behaving like the paternal one.</p>
<p>The causes of this abnormality can be:  A genetic mutation or deletion to cause loss of imprinting, an uniparental disomy, i.e. two copies of one parental chromosome, here paternal UPD or an epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting (rare).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (FDA approved) is a drug against DNA metyltransferases. It targets the epigenetic machinery as chemotherapeutic It is a demethylating agent used to treat myelodisplasic syndrome that progressed to AML. It is a DNMT inhibitor (nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA). It is replication dependent.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of DNMTi and its impact on DNA methylation is still unclear. It has been seen that extremely high doses of the drug are toxic, as it is not selective. However, at lower doses, the DNA demethylation is effective and the drug has an important anti-neoplasic effect.</p>
<p>As anti-tumour drug, Decitabine reverses the DNA promoter methylation (epigenetic alteration). It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which restores downstream gene transcription.</p>
<p>Decitabine can be used in diagnostics (as biomarker), in prognostics and in therapy (as a small molecule that inhibits the epigenetic machinery).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p>A sensitive period, in mammals, is the period for epigenetic reprogramming when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. The epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic development sets up epigenetic state.</p>
<p>It is in the sensitive periods during embryogenesis, when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained</p>
<p>In mammals, the sensitive periods of development are the periods of early development, such as the stage of gametes, fertilized egg, blastocyst and epiblast.</p>
<p>At these periods, the inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression patterns from parent to offspring by passage through the germ cells is not explained by genetic differences.</p>
<p>By treating patients during sensitive periods, the alterations in the epigenetic marks could be passed through the germ cells till the next generations. This would be inadvisable there are still just a few studies that show the good effect of the treatment.</p>
<p>As Hassler and Egger says: “We are just starting to unravel the cancer epigenome and latest mechanistic findings provide the first clue as to how altered epigenetic patterns might occur in different cancers”.</p>
