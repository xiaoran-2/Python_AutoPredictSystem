    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer. </span></p>
<p><span>In cancer we see that the DNA methylation of a chromosome is altered. It is more dense at the CpG islands, but the global level of methylation decreases.</span></p>
<p><span>CpG islands are found in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes. They are normally hypomethylated, so they can put the tumour suppressor genes to work. When they get hypermethylated, as in cancer, they are silenced. This means the tumour suppressor genes are not promoted any more and a tumour can grow, so we have cancer.</span></p>
<p>With intergenic regions and repetive elements it's the other way around. They are usually methylated, which ensures genomic stability, by preventing loss, gain or illegitimate recombination of chromosomes. The loss of methylation opens up the repeats, that then can align and cause illegitimate recombination of the repeats. The hypomethylation of the repeats also makes it possible for them to copy themselves and transpose, jump around the genome. Depending on where they land, they can disrupt a genes coding region or activate genes, thus causing genomic instability which contibutes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, imprinting causes methylation of the paternal allele. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, this means the imprint control region is methylated. The enhancers can act on the Igf2 and it is expressed.</span></p>
<p>The maternal allele is not methylated. Therefore, CTCF can bind to the imprint control region and insulate it. The enhancers now act on H19, but the Igf2 is silenced. </p>
<p>If there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region of the maternal allele, the CTCF can not bind there and the Igf2 is not silenced, but expressed, Together with the paternal allele, you now have double expression of Igf2. So you have a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting. This causes Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>So imprinting causes mono-allelic parent-of-origin-specific expression. And disruption of this imprinting can cause overexpression, like in Wilm's tumours, or underexpression, depending on the place and whether there is methylation on both alleles or on neither of the alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Q3. The Economist article “</span><a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer’s epicentre</a><span>” describes several drugs that affect epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer, with reference to effects on the epigenome.</span></p>
<p><span>The drug Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It works by getting incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 then comes to bind to the nucleotide, it binds it irreversibly so it can not copy the methylation to the daughter strand.</span></p>
<p>Given in low doses, we see a good effect of Decitabine on myelodysplastic syndrome, that is dependend on heavy hypermethylation of CpG islands. By administering Decitabine, de CpG islands get demethylated. And that means they wil promote the tumour depressor genes that in their turn will stop controlled cell growth.</p>
<p>Together with regular cancer treatment, Decitabine could even have an effect on solid tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, so every time a cell that has altered DNA methylation divides, that altered DNA methylation is passed on to the daughter cell. Furthermore, epimutations are rapidly selected for, so these cells multiply more often than the normal cells. So even when you stop taking the drug, the cells that are already epimutated, will divide to give more epimutated cells and even more so than normal cells do. This means you still have a growing number of epimutated cells.</p>
<p><span>There are periods in which the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. One of the two main sensitive periods is just after fertilisation; pre-implatation and early post-implantation. The second is in the embryo the developing primordal germ cells through  production of the eggs and sperm. There are also brief sensitive periods in development the organs.</span></p>
<p><span>So before and during pregnancy, it would be inadvisable to treat patients that alter DNA methylation, as you would be inhibiting the epigenetic machines and changing the DNA methylation and thus probably the health of the offspring. And in young people with developing organs, you could disturb that development.</span></p>
