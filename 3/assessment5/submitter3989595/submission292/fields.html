    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation patterns in tumor cells are altered relative to thoseof normal cells . A global hypomethylation  of the genome is accompanied by region especific hypermethylation the region wich appear to be frequent targets of hypermethylation event are CpG island. CpG island methylation is rare in normal cells , playing  a role X-cromossome inactivation and impriting , increasing with age , and  with in vitro cell culture. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Example for H19/Igf2 in Disruption of genomic neighbourhood at the imprinted IGF2-H19 locus in Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome and Silver–Russell syndrome</p>
<p>The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene . This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing<br />the promoters to access the enhancers. In mice, we and others have shown that the higher order chromatin structure at the locus differs between maternal and paternal alleles and that on the maternal allele CTCF mediates a looping structure that sequesters the enhancers away from the Igf2 promoters </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine are so-called hypomethylating agents. It is thought that they take chemical groups (known as methyl groups) away from the DNA of cancer cells, thereby allowing normal genes to become active again, while the cancer genes become suppressed (silenced).After azanucleosides have been metabolized to 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, they can become substrates for the DNA replication machinery and will be incorporated into DNA, where azacytosine can substitute for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized by the DNA methyltransferases as natural substrate and the enzymes will initiate the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in the establishment of a covalent bond between the carbon-6 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. The bond is normally resolved by beta-elimination through the carbon-5 atom, but the reaction is blocked with azacytosine, where carbon-5 is substituted by nitrogen.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A major element of epigenetic regulation in vertebrates is the pattern of distribution of a covalent<br />modiﬁcation of cytosines by methylation in the genome. The primary methylated sequence in<br />vertebrates is composed of only two bases, the di-nucleotide sequence CG . Only &lt;80% of<br />the methylatable CG population is methylated. Different CG sites are methylated in different<br />tissues, creating a pattern of methylation that is gene and tissue speciﬁc . This pattern creates<br />a layer of information that confers upon a genome its speciﬁc cell type identity. The DNA methylation pattern is copied by independent enzymatic machinery, the DNMT . DNA methylation patterns in vertebrates are distinguished by their tight correlation with chromatin structure.</p>
<p>DNA methylation could be modiﬁed pharmacologically. By modiﬁcation of DNA methylation, it would be possible to alter gene expression programs, including those for pathological gene expression. There are potentially multiple diseases that are candidates for DNA methylation therapy. The critical issues are: understanding the aberrations in methylation involved in the disease, the complexity of the DNA methylation machinery, and the multiple interactions of the DNA methylation machinery with other cellular machineries.<br /><br /></p></div>
