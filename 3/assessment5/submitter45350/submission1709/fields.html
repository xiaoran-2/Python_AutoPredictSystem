    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG island at promoter of a gene results in silencing of expression of this gene. This is one of the mechanism of imprinting. Cancer cells typically display overall hypomethylation but hypermethylation of CpG islands. Silencing of genes that regulate cell division, apoptosis, DNA-repairing genes and genes involved in cell adhesion is associated with cancer.</p>
<p>Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions suppresses transposones and "junk" promoters activity. Overall hypomethylation associated with cancer relieves this suppression which results in genome instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Being chemically analogous to some of DNA components decitabine incorporates into DNA upon replication. After replication, when DNMT moves along DNA, decitabine binds irreversibly with DNMT. This process drives DNA hypomethylation further (remember DNA in cancer cells are already hypomethylated) which and hopefully could result in unviable cancer cells generation. Decitabine is nonspecific and affects whole patient's body but since cancer cells are typically have higher replication rate than most normal somatic cells - cancer cells are at a disadvantage in environment with proper concentration of decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster consists of lgf2 gene, cluster's ICR, H19 gene and enhancers in downstream order. Maternal allele is unmethylated which allows for expression of H19 gene under effect of enhancers and recruitment of CTCF insulator protein to ICR locus. CTCF, being between lgf2 locus and enhancers, acts as a barrier for enhancers' influence averting lgf2 expression. Paternal allele is methylated at ICR and H19's promoter loci thus preventing recruitment of CTCF, silencing H19 expression and allowing for enhancers to promote expression of Igf2. Normal cells have one maternally imprinted allele and one paternally imprinted allele thus having lgf2 being expressed from one chromosome. Cancer cells typically have CpG islands hypermethylated which is the case with Wilm’s tumor and H19/Igf2 cluster. Effectively, these cells have two paternal alleles which leads to overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth-promoting hormone which is one of hallmarks of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is persistent over cell replication and damage because of nuclear machinery, specifically DNA methyltransferase.  Persistence of epigenetic marks could be naturally interrupted by particular events of epigenome rebuilding during which it is susceptible to intervention. These sensitive periods are during early embryo and germ cells development. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods could irreversibly damage epigenome of embryo and germ cells.</p></div>
