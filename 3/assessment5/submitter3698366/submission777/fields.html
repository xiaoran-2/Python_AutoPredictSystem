    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is just a simple addition of a single methyl (CH3-) group to cytosine at position 5.In mammals, it can almost exclusively happen only on cytosines preceding guanine (CpG) in the DNA sequence. CpG methylation is essential for life. DNA methylation is established and maintained by specific DNA methyltransferases By keeping CpG islands methylation-free, normal cells allow the working for gene expression open, clean and clear of obstructions. DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons). Besides global hypomethylation, most cancers also  affect hypermethylation which progresses with time. Affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone which causes diseases. In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding intergenic regions, whereas in  a cancerous cell they are found in high density. The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less methylcytosine than the genome of a healthy cell. In fact, cancer cell genomes have 20-50% less methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides across the genome. In cancer cells “global hypomethylation” due to disruption in (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis.  In a cancer cell there is hypomethylation genome wide and tumor suppressor hypermethylation. Decreased amount of H4K16ac is found in cancer cells It gives rise to deseases like Glioma which is found in children which is result of H3.1 and H3.3.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGF2 is expressed from paternal allele. <span>One of the epigenetic modifications thought to be involved in parental imprinting is DNA methylation. In a normal cell igf2 is expressed in paternal allele and h19 is expressed in maternal allele, normally several sites upstream of H19 in paternal allele are methylated whereas in maternal allele are unmethylated in a normal cell. In a tumor cell ie in Wilms tumor the maternal allele reverses its role and accquires a paternal pattern ie the promoter region of H19 gets methylated, IGF2 is turned on whereas H19 is turned off which causes increase in the cell growth. This change of loss of H19 on maternal allele gives rise to diseases like wilm's tumor which can happen independently or can be dependent on paternal allele.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is hypomethylating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. It reduces DNA methylation in solid tumors. In a cancer cell there is hypomethylation genome wide and tumor suppressor hypermethylation observed. When decitabine is induced in such cancer patients  there is a sudden decrease in global hypomethylation observed and it augments <span> CTR1 expression through methylation-independent mechanisms.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation gives rise to activation of oncogenes. It also inactivates the tumor suppressor genes which decreses the proliferation. Due to this there is CpG hypermethylation and hypomethylation which causes cancerous cells to grow. Sensitive period is the period pf exposure.Duiing this period there is development of brain and other functions of the brain. Treating patients during this period affects the DNA methylation patterns. Sensitive periods of development are birth to 6 years(sensory learning), language exposion, development co-ordination, reading learning etc.</p>
