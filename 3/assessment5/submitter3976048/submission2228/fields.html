    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Throughout the genome CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, however if methylation occurs it is correlated with gene silencing. In cancer we can observe a general decrease in genome methylation, however locally CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. They are placed the most often in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes what leads to the gene silencing while oncogenes are unmethylated and actively transcribed. This together with general genome demethylation provides the possibility of indefinite growth to the tumour. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated throughout the genome. This is to provide genomic stability and prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination. In cancer intergenic regions are always demethylated. This results in deletions, insertions, recripocal translocations, general genomic instability and promotes tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR region on paternal allele is methylated. This methylation spreads on to H19 gene promoter and the gene is being silenced. Because of ICR region methylation enhancers that are located downstream are promoting Igf2 gene replication. Igf2 gene is linked with the cell growth.  On maternal allele ICR region is unmethylated and is bound by CTCF protein that prevents enhancers from promoting Igf2 gene transcription. Igf2 gene is then silenced. At the same time H19 gene promoter region is unmethylated and gene is being transcribed. <br />Wilms tumour is associated with  H19/Igf2 cluster. Tumour most likely occurs when maternal allele of the individual starts acting like a paternal allele. It means that both, maternal and paternal ICR regions are methylated. This leads to an increased transcription of Igf2 gene and promotes tumour growth since the gene is now being expressed on both alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of hypomethylating agents used to treat myleodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In patients with MDS, blood production is ineffective mostly because of DNA hypermethylation in genes regions. Decitabine decreases DNA methylation by irreversible covalent binding to DNA methyltransferase and inhibiting its function. It results in loss of DNA methylation and stops gene silencing. As a result genes are being expressed and blood cells differentiated properly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically hereditable. It means that DNA methylation pattern is transferred to daughter cells after mitosis. This provides tissue specific stability. After mitosis, when the old DNA strand is paired to the new one, the methylation pattern is being reconstructed by DNA methyltransferase on the new strand. When methylation pattern is changed by drugs the same mechanism occurs. The new, changed pattern is being reconstructed on daughter cells even after the treatment has finished. <br />Despite methylation pattern remaining generally constant during lifetime we can point out periods when DNA methylation pattern is being intensively remodelled. These are called "sensitive periods" and they occur twice in the development: first, shortly after fertilisation, in the very first stages of foetus development and second, later, while primordial germ cells are being developed in foetus. <br />Since DNA methylation pattern is mitotically hereditable it would be inadvisable to treat patients with methylation pattern changing agents during sensitive periods. They could possibly interrupt or change the proper methylation process and such changes would then be passed on daughter cells during mitosis. This might result in improper development or genetic changes passed on to offspring.</p></div>
