    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>To put it simply, the DNA methylation pattern is reversed in a cancerous cell when compared to a non-cancerous cell.  As mentioned throughout this lecture series, the presence of methylation can inversely affect gene expression.  Hypermethylation in inappropriate areas, such as in CpG islands can cause suppression of suppressor genes that help inhibit cancers.  Likewise, hypomethylation in inappropriate areas, such as repeats, can cause genomic instabilities that lend themselves to the rise of cancers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a non-cancerous cell, the promoter CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor genes are rarely, if ever, methylated.  Low/no methylation allows expression of tumor suppressor genes, which in turn provide one mechanism by which the cell can prevent out of control growth.  In a cancerous cell, the CpG islands that direct tumor suppressor gene expression are more likely to be hypermethylated.  By becoming hypermethylated at those promoter CpG islands, the cell essentially suppresses the tumor suppressor, thereby removing one feedback control mechanism regarding growth.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In non-cancerous cells, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are more likely to be methylated, resulting in non-expression of those genes.  In a cancerous cell, genome-wide hypomethylation can be seen, most commonly at repeats, but also at intergenic regions.  The hypomethylation results in increased gene expression, which can lead to illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of surrounding genes, all of which lead to genomic instability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By themselves, hypermethylation of the CpG islands <strong>or</strong> hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions may not give rise to cancerous cells, but the presence of both hypermethylation of the CpG islands <strong>and</strong> hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions does increase the likelihood of cancerous growth because tumor suppression is lost <strong>and</strong> genomic instability is increased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors that act upon DNA methyltransferase.  It has been FDA-approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors to acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that has been modified so that it is a nucleoside analog and can be incorporated into the DNA during cell replication.  It affects DNA methylation by permanently binding to the DNA methyltransferase when it binds to the nucleotides to copy the methylation onto the DNA daughter strand.  The effectiveness of decitabine is dependent of the rapid replication of the cancerous cells.  It is thought that decitabine’s effectiveness on myelodysplastic syndromes is due the presence of hypermethylation of CpG islands in these cancerous cells.  Drawing on the last week’s lectures, perhaps demethylating the hypermethylated CpG islands would lead to the expression of the tumor suppressor genes, which would lead to a decrease in cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Any drug that can alter DNA methylation should have an effect that will outlast the treatment period because methylation is mitotically heritable.  By affecting the methylation pattern of a cancerous cell, the drug is effectively affecting all subsequent daughter cells that come from that single cancerous cell.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A woman who conceives while on DNA methylation-altering drugs will cause changes in her child's methylation pattern.  Furthermore, if the child is a male, the exposure to the drugs may also affect the child's children as well since the male primordial germ line is set in-utero.  This occurs because the epigenome has two very sensitive periods in which the whole epigenome may be reprogrammed.  These periods include very early development, especially the period from post-fertilization to implantation of the blastocyst, and the time in which the germ cell lines are developed.  Exposure to DNA methylation-altering drugs at these times can have transgenerational effect.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Transgenerational alterations of DNA methylation may not be desirable because it may affect the expression of genes and genomic stability in unknown ways, especially if the use of DNA methylation altering drugs was to treat a specific disorder or disease that was not heritable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation can occur in the imprint control region in cancer.  In Wilm’s tumor, a disruption in the methylation pattern, resulting in hypermethylation of the ICR and a loss of imprint control can be seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell, IGF2 is only expressed from the paternal allele and is silenced in the maternal allele.  The imprint control region on the maternal allele of a normal cell is unmethylated and H19 is produced.  The imprint control region of the paternal allele of a normal cell is methylated and IGF2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a cell that is part of Wilm’s tumor, IGF2 is expressed by both the maternal and paternal allele because there is methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, in addition to that seen on the paternal allele.  Given that IGF2 is a growth promoter, a cell with IGF2 expressed by both sets of alleles will have more growth promoter than a normal cell.  Excess growth promoter can lead to cancer-like behavior, especially in the presence of genome wide hypomethylation.</p></div>
