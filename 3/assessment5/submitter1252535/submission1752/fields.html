    <h1>Submission 1752 from Anon (session_user_id: 65eff0eb6bbafc4f6bbec2a5211544a0651224e5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is hypomethylating agent. It is a nucleoside molecule, which can be incorporated into DNA <span>strands. Decitabine </span></span><span>hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine decreases DNA methylation of tumor supressor genes helping to reduce tumor cell proliferation.   </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can cause long-lasting effects. An <span>epigenetic changes are passed in cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. When we are adult, it is difficalt to modify normal cells, but cancer cells are very sensitive. <span>The other important point is epigenetically sensitive periods in development.  There are essentially two periods when there is a dramatic decline in global DNA methylation and a subsequent steady increase in methylation. One is during the formation of the progenitors of the gametes, the primordial germ cells, during in utero development. This takes place while the gonads are being formed and allows for the deposition of a sex specific epigenetic imprint pattern. The second is just after fertilization in the early zygote. The critical remethylation periods therefore occur very early in pregnancy during a time when the mother is often not aware that she is pregnant. If we use drugs, which alter DNA methylation, in pregnant woman, w<span>e would expect potentially serious side effects to the fetus. Use these drugs for young children also can cause long-lasting unpredictable effects when they are adult and even in following generations.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IGF2 gene encodes protein named insulin-like growth factor 2, which is responsible for growth and development before birth. It is much less active in the adult body. For the IGF2 gene, only the paternal copy is active copy. Methylation normally silence the maternal Igf2 gene. It is phenomenon called genomic imprinting. IGF2 is part of a cluster of genes on the short arm of chromosome 11. Another gene in this cluster, H19, is also involved in growth and development. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 1 (ICR1) or the H19 differentially methylated region (H19 DMR) controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of both the H19 and IGF2 genes. Because the ICR1 region controls the genomic imprinting of the H19 and IGF2 genes, its abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. ICR1 hypermethylation leads to a loss of H19 gene activity and increased activity of the IGF2 gene. These both events, together, lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors. Also lost of methylation of maternal IGF2 gene can activate it, resulting in two active copies of the gene. Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identified in Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation in CpG islands plays a significant role in gene expression regulation, especially needed in cell differentiation, in imprinting of genes, in X-chromosome inactivation. Normally CpG islands are un-methylated. In cancer, genome-wide methylation of specific genes (especially tumor suppressing genes) may occur. High frequency methylation in CpG islands named CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) detected in many cancers, especially in colon. CIMP is associated with particular mutations (BRAF, KRAS and other) and overexpression of DNA methyltransferases.  In normal tissue, <span>DNA in <span>intergenic regions and </span>repetitive elements (REs) are highly methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions and REs mantainces genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, by silencing or mutation of repeats to prevent transposition and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. A methylation of REs may prevent irregular recombination. In cancer, hypomethylation at intergenic regions and REs leads to genomic instability, resulting in high degree of mutations in genomic DNA and creating of abnornal karyotype found in many cancers.</span></p></div>
