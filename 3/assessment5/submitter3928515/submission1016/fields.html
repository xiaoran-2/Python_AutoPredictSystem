    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions within the promoters of genes characterized by a high density of CpG dinucleotides. In a normal cell, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, regardless of their activity state. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, leading to gene silencing. This occurs because methylated CpG can be bound by CpG binding proteins that then recruit factors that condense chromatin, giving rise to a repressive chromatin structure. Hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes leads to silencing of these genes that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis, among other functions, and can lead to the uncontrolled growth seen in cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, DNA methylation is often present in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells. At intergenic regions, DNA methylation can maintain genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, while DNA methylation within repetitive elements functions by preventing illegitimate recombinations and preventing transposition. In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability, as illegitimate recombinations and transposition may now occur, leading to the disruption of gene transcription and function if these recombinations or transposable elements insert into active genes. This could lead to activation of oncogenes or silencing of tumour suppressor genes and contribute to tumour progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of an imprint control region, where DNA methylation status is determined by whether the allele was paternally or maternally inherited. The paternal allele of this ICR is methylated, while the maternal allele is unmethylated. Methylation of this ICR prevents CTCF, an insulator protein, from binding. Without CTCF bound to the ICR, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 expression. At the same time, downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate its expression. On the other hand, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, blocking the downstream enhancer from activation Igf2 expression. At the same time, H19 remains unmethylated, so the enhancers activate H19 expression instead. Therefore, H19 is expressed from the maternal allele, while Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at this cluster can lead disease by altering the dosage or expression level of Igf2, which is an oncogene. For example, methylation of the maternal allele at the ICR, or inheriting two paternal alleles leads to an overdose of Igf2, since Igf2 is now expressed from two alleles. These two imprinting errors are common causes of Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that the methylation marks are maintained during DNA replication and cell division. On the other hand, there are also sensitive periods during which there is active remodeling of the epigenome, and epigenetic marks are actively removed and laid down. There are two sensitive periods during development – during primordial germ cell development, and in the pre-implantation/early post-implantation embryo. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because altering the environment during this period will have effects on the epigenetic marks that are laid down. Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, this can have life-long effects. Furthermore, this can lead to transgenerational effects, affecting the patient's offspring. This can be seen in the administration of the fungicide vinclozolin to mid-gestation mother rats. This is also the period of primordial germ cell development in the embryo of the mother rat. Male offspring of these treated rats show infertility, and female offspring also show an affected phenotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine works by binding irreversibly to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), preventing DNMTs from performing its normal function of maintaining the methylation state of DNA. As such, administration of Decitabine leads to a loss of DNA methylation at previously methylated regions, giving rise to DNA hypomethylation. Decitabine can thus have an anti-tumour effect by removing methyl groups from aberrantly methylated DNA cancerous cells. Re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes involved in regulating cell cycle, differentiation and apoptotic pathways could stop uncontrolled tumour growth, give rise to apoptosis of cancerous cells and restore normal cell growth, thus acting as an anti-cancer drug. </p></div>
