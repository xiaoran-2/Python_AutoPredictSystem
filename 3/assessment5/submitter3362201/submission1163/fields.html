<p>CpG Island are thought to be coordinating regulation of transcription and replication.  As they are more unmethylated, they are allowing the genes to function.  If they become hypermethylated, such as during cancer, the genes will be silenced and perhaps allowing less regulation of transcription and replication.  If they are now no longer regulated well,  errors in transcription will all the cancer cells to keep their mutations and will allow them to replicate.  Repetitive elements and retroviral insertions are methylated at intergenetic regions.  In cancer those regions could become less methylated and those areas now able to express themselves.  Hypomethylation could occur at satellite repeats.Hypomethylation is genome wide causingvarious problems including loss of imprinting.  All of this will cause instability,  deregulation and silencing of tumor suppressing genes or activating an oncogene.  Hypermethylation of the promoter of CpG islands is known to affect apoptosis and repair as well as control of cell cycles. CpG probably contains tumor suppressor genes and methylating it causes them to loose that function. Hypermethylation is locus specific  also causing various problems.   Changes in methylation is also  associated with chromatin modifying comlexes because of deregulation of IncRNAs.  Other epigenetic changes also cause the silencing of tumor supppressor genes,  such as heterochromatin surrounding INK4b-ARK-INK4a.  Three different pathways were suggested for locking in the cancer epigenome.  DNMTS, histone modifiers or chromatin remodelers may be mutated. Epigenetic complexes that are altered by IncRNAs or transcription factors may lead to gene changes. Loss of boundaries could cause altered nuclear territories whcih  would force altered gene expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and Igf2 are on the same chromosome and both imprinted in a reciprocal manner.  If the paternal allele is metholated the Ifg2 will be expressed.  During cancer, genes that should be imprinted, are not. Either both parental alleles are expressed or both are not.  This is an area of growth suppression or promoting. The maternal allele is usually unmethylated at the insulator by binding of CTCF at the imprint control region  and enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is not expressed.  The paternal allele is methylated at  the imprint control region and CTCF is not binding. The enhancers act on Igf2 and not H19.  When both maternal and paternal imprint control regions are methylated,  Igf2 will be expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles and it will be a double dose of what it should be.  This is a growth promoter .  This causes kidney tumors in very early development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as DNA-demethylating agents. These are drugs that target DNA methyl transferase inhibitors,  DNAMTi.  This drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrom that progressed to AML. These nucleoside analogues are incorporated into DNA during replication, DNMT1  must then bind to it, but when it goes to replicate,  it can't because of this binding.  DNMT is irreversibly bound.  As cancer cells replicate more rapidly,  they will be most affected.  Previously DNAMTi were used at high dosages that were toxic and did not work.  Lately, they have been used at much lower dosages to target the point of DNA demethylation and work much more effectively.  They seem to be causing DNA methylation and killing the tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylinused combinations of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine with some good results and even had results when used with chemotherapy.  These drugs may bind the dna and the histones more tightly which could prevent transcription of the cancer genes.  They restore normal patterns of histones.During sensitive periods include  the pre-implantation period of early development  and primordial germ cell devopment.  During these sensitive time periods reprogramming may occur.  Treating young patients during the time when they are in a sensitive time period and developing germ cells would take considerable consideration as epigenetic marks could change the next generation. It doesn't appear that all is known about the mechanism of HDAC, but the fact that they are tolerated well and work makes them valuable tools in fighting cancer. </p>
