    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called <em>CpG islands</em>, which are present in the 5' regulatory regionsof many genes. In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in <a class="mw-redirect" title="Transcriptional silencing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_silencing">t</a>ranscriptional silencing  that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Also, As compared with normal cells, the malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns.<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;"> </span>Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation involves CpG islands.</p>
<p><span>The unique and repeated sequences in  the genome are often highly methylated at their CpG sites in somatic tissues. <span>CpG dinucleotides are often aberrantly methylated in human cancers to give regional hypermethylation at some CpG islands despite an overall reduction in 5-methylcytosine in the DNA (global DNA hypomethylation) </span><span>. The frequent hypomethylation of repetitive elements in diverse human cancers is thought to largely account for the global hypomethylation commonly seen in human cancers.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The  </span><em>Igf2</em><span> and </span><em>H19</em><span> genes lie 70-kb apart on chromosome 7 and are reciprocally imprinted. <span>A differentially methylated region upstream of </span><em>H19</em><span> (H19-DMR), serving as the imprinting control region, determines the reciprocal expression of </span><em>H19</em><span> from the maternal allele and </span><em>Igf2</em><span> from the paternal allele.</span></span></p>
<p>In Wilm's tumors the transcriptionally silent maternal IGF2 allele is activated such that IGF2 expression occurs biallelically. <span> methylation of the maternal </span><em>H19</em><span> DMR includes CTCF-binding sites</span><span> . These would suggest that increased or ectopic activity of a DNA methyltransferase might lead to aberrant methylation of the maternal </span><em>H19</em><span> DMR.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;"> </span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </p>
<p><span>Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The aberrant epigenetic landscape of the cancer cell is characterized by a global genomic hypomethilation, CpG</span><span> island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes</span><span>, an altered h</span>istone<span> code for critical genes and a global loss of monoacetylated and trimethylated histone H4. So, since epigenome <span>consists of a record of the chemical changes to the DNA</span><span> and histone</span><span> proteins of an organism; these changes can be passed down to an organism's offspring.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sensitive periods are those time span </span></span>of exposure during establishment of epigenetic marks. we can identify them as Early development (blastocyst stage) and Primordial cells development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sentitive periods would be inadvisable because in those stages we are really suceptible and can occur an hypermethylation or hypomethylation on the wrong sites, so the pating would develop a new disease.</p></div>
