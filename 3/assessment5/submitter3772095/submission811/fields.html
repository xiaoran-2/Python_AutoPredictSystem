    <h1>Submission 811 from Anon (session_user_id: 2e0a4c005f7c0d2d5dd5fbf95d8964ec29039747)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  According to Dr. Blewitt's lecture, DNMTi's work by being incorporated into the DNA during replication.  When the DNMT1 tries to lay down the methylation to the daughter cell, it is bound to the DNMTi and the methylation cannot be replicated.  In other words, the daughter cells, and granddaughter cells do not have the methylation the parent cell had.  In cancer, hypermethylation is frequently found in the CpG islands, which are often found in tumor suppressor genes.  When the CpG islands are hypermethylated they are silenced, therefore allowing tumors to form and grow.  Removing (inhibiting) the methylation will allow the tumor suppressor genes to do their job and prevent the tumors from growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As I mentioned in Q3, Dr. Blewitt said in her lecture that once the DNMTi stops the DNMT1 from methylating the DNA, that "non-methylation" is replicated in the daughter cells and the subsequent generations of cells.  Even after the drug treatment stops, since the cells that are replicating are non-methylated, the future cells are also non-methylated.  </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are those when the environment can influence the epigenetic make-up.  Those sensitive periods are from the development of primoridal germ cells until the production of mature gametes, and the pre-implantation through early post-implantation stages.  In discussing cancer treatment, the sensitive period we are concerned about is the one beginning with the development of primoridal germ cells.  Using these epigenetic drugs is inadvisable during sensitive periods because they do not select for tumor cells, but affect every cell.  Since we don't yet know of the affects on the developing germ cells, and therefore on future generations (of people, not just cells), it would be best to err on the side of caution.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is made up of several parts.  There is the Igf2 gene, followed by the ICR (Imprint Control Region), followed by the H19 gene, follwed by enhancers.  In a normal cell the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele which allows it to bind to CTCF.  The enhancers can't get past the CTCF, therefore they act on H19 which is expressed.  On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, which causes the enhancers to act on Igf2, which is expresseed, rather than H19, which is unexpressed.  Together, there is a single dose of H19 and a single dose of Igf2 expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, instead of the normal imprinting, the ICRs on both alleles are methylated.  Therefore, H19 is silenced while Igf2 is expressed from both alleles.  Igf2 is a growth promoter.  Since both alleles are expressing Igf2, the double dose promotes excess growth and causes Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are not methylated.  Instead, methylation is found on the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions, and the introns of genes.  In cancer cells, the situation is reversed.  The CpG islands are methylated and we find hypomethylation of the repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns.  CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  When the CpG islands are methylated they are silenced, therefore not allowing the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed.  With nothing to suppress the tumors, they are allowed to grow.</p>
<p>In normal cells methylation in the intergenic regions promotes genomic stability.  In other words, it prevents insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.  It maintains the normal karyotype.  Intergenic methylation also serves to prevent collisions of RNA polymerase 2 when there is another promoter between genes that heads in the opposite direction.  A collision would prevent the genes from replicating correctly.  Another function is to silence splice sequences that appear in places other than splice sites.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements make copies of themselves and insert themselves in different parts of the genome.  The long terminal repeat contains a promoter that allows the gag and pol proteins to be expressed, which, in turn, allow the repetitive elements to perform their copying function.  In order to prevent those genes from inserting themselves into places where they are not wanted, methylation of the long terminal repeats silences the genes so they can't make the gag and pol proteins.</p>
<p>When the repetitive elements are hypomethylated, instead of the genes' being packed into heterochromatin, they are opened into euchromatin thereby allowing  them to interrupt the normal coding of a gene or activate genes that should not be activated, leading to abnormalities in the karyotype (insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations) which can then cause cancer.</p></div>
