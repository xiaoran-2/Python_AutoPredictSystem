    <div class="field-value"><p>(Based on Hassler MR, Egger G.)</p>
<p>In normal state of an organism DNA methylation of a promoter region has a suppressing role in gene expression. The main known exceptions are the CpG islands in gene promoters (these regions have very high CpG density), as these are generally methylation free, regardless the activity of the linked gene. When the cell becomes cancerous, the usually "clean" promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated. And as in healthy cells in general, this hypermethylation results in a suppressing of the corresponding gene expression. This in fact can have quite serious consequences, because they not only lead genetic instability (as we will also discuss below), but in many cases they also result in silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Another consequence of gene silencing can be the destabilization of upstream chromatin boundary, also resulting in an aberrant gene expression.</p>
<p> In contrast to promoter CpG islands, in normal cells the different intron regions and the repetitive elements found through the genome are hypermethylated.  This corresponds to gene silencing. In case of repetitive elements (satellite repeats, virus remnants), methylation clearly not only serves to silence their expression, but also to restrict their ability in moving around the genome or in replicating themselves. For the intergenic regions (introns) the methylation seems to reduce the eventual genetic noise which would arise from the presence of alternative translation start sites, antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. In cancer, these regions get genome wide hypomethylated, resulting in aberrant genetic activity, so in genetic instability. The deregulation of gene expression will destroy the tissue specific functioning and the imprinted gene regulation patterns. The reactivation of repetitive elements results in a genome wide remodeling of the structure (gene recombination, doubling and replication of repetitive elements) and strongly promotes the destruction of chromatin and cell nucleus structure.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a recently commercialized drug to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is sold by Eisai, a Japanese pharmaceutical company. While in high doses it is incorporated into the DNA, resulting in cell death, its low dose application is related to epigenetic processes: it is a demethylating agent acting by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (see also the corresponding Wikipedia page).</p>
<p>In healthy cells, the DNA promoter CpG islands are generally unmethylated. In cancer, this general pattern changes - the previously clean promoter CpG islands get methylated, which results in their general suppression. Particularly important consequences have the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. In addition, once these methyl marks are laid down, they are conserved during cell division by the DNA methyltransferase enzyme, which copies them on the newly formed DNA strand. Inhibiting the conservation, Decitabine helps re-activating the tumor suppressor genes in the daughter cells and so helps tumor cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark; not only as it is maintained through the life of the cell, but as it is also transferred to daughter cells during DNA duplication. One of the enzymes responsible for this transfer is DNA methyltransferase, copying the methylation pattern to the newly formed DNA strands.</p>
<p>The methylation pattern is formed / modified during two important periods of the life of an organism when new methylation pattern is laid down: after fertilization till the blastocyst and during the primordial germ cell development.  These periods are called sensitive, because any changes might have long lasting (even hereditary, at least through the cell line) effects on the epigenetic control patterns. Clearly, not only the period of pregnancy, but also the early adolescent years are significant, when germ cell development starts. Even more, the period before fertilization, during maturing the gametes might also play crucial role.</p>
<p>Treatment of patients with epigenetic drugs within these sensitive periods might disrupt the eigenetic programming / reprogramming. Since the epigenetic marks are hereditary at least through the cell lines, disruption of their production can easily lead to aberrant gene activity and thus non-functional or cancerous cell generation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster show different epigenetic pattern in the two parental alleles. An ICR located within the cluster regulates the gene activity by blocking or allowing the activity of downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>The ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, which allows an insulator protein (CTCF) to bind. This protein insulates the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers and thus suppresses its expression. The H19 gene remains active.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ICR on the paternal allele does get methylated, blocking the binding of the insulator protein and thus allowing the action of the downstream enhancers and so keeping the Igf2 gene active. In addition, the methylation spread to the promoter region of the H19 gene, suppressing it.</p>
<p>If  the paternal/maternal imprint is damaged, the methylation pattern might get distorted, resulting in abnormal expression of the different genes. Hyphermetilation of the ICR region, that is when the maternal allele behaves as a paternal one, downregulate H19 and upregulates Igf2. Since lgf2 is an oncogene, growth promoter, its overdose might results in fetal or post-natal overgrowth or in tumor development, like the Wilm's (kidney) tumor.</p>
