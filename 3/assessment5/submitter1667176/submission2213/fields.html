    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs), a genomic regions with dense position of CpG-sites, located in ~60% of promoters and participate in regulation of gene activity. Normally CGIs are unmethylated independently of gene activity state. In cancer aberrant hypermethylation of promoter CGIs is observed and associated with silencing of respective genes. If those hypermethylation occur in tumour suppressor gene, lack or absence of its product can lead to uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. CGI methylation tend to progress with time and vary in different tumout types, therefore can be used as effective biomarker. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally suppress their transcription activity and avoid inappropriate recombination in these regions, thereby maintaining genome stability. In cancer global DNA hypomethylation lead to activation of cryptic gene promoters, illegitimate recombination, transcription and transposition of repetitive elements, known as genomic instability and detected as increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations (deletions, insersions, translocations). These alterations contribute to abnormal genome functioning and heterogeneity of tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 includes respective genes and control region of imprinting (ICR) between them. On paternal allele ICR is methylated that avoid binding of CTCF protein and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter resulting in its silencing. Without CTCF enhancers, laid downstream from H19/Igf2 cluster, can access Igf2 promoter and activate this gene. So, Igf2 is expressed. On maternal allele ICR is not methylated that provide its binding with CTCF protein. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and Igf2 is not expressed. Additionally, hypomethylation of ICR and accessibility of enhancers provide expression of H19 on maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour loss of imprinting is observed. That is aberrant methylation pattern of maternal allele, similar to those on paternal, lead to overexpression of Igf2 protein that supports abundant growth of tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to class of demethylating agents that irreversibly inhibit enzymes DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Chemically it represents a cytidine analogue that can be incorporated into synthesized DNA chain and then irreversibly join with DNMT1 (maintaining DNA methylation) or DNMT3a/b (if de novo DNA methylation). It uses for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes that can lead to acute myeloid leukemia. Evidently, in this case more important epigenetic change is DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes and ICRs of imprinted genes. Therefore, DNMT inhibition can return hypermethylated CpGs in tumour genome to unmethylated state and reactivate normal gene functioning. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs, altering DNA methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome as this epigenetic modification (DNA methylation) is rather stable that means methylation state can preserve during mitosis and be inherited within cell linages. Full erasion and re-establishment of epigenetic marks occur only twice  - during early development stage till blastocyst and gametogenesis in embriogenic development. This stages called sensitive periods as in that time environmental influences have the most significant impact on fomation of subsequent epigenotype. So, treating patients in this periods can significant consequences on their offspring and thereby it's inadvasible to treat women during pregnancy and famine during peri-conceptional period (when early oogenesis is still occur).</p></div>
