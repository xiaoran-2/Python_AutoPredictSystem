    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, CpG islands on promoters can become hypermethylated. This hypermethylation causes the genes to be silenced. In normal CpG islands, there is no methylation. In intergenic and repetitive regions, methylation is thought to decrease the amount of transcriptional noise. This noise is caused by multiple start sites, and methylation can prevent this problem. Cancer cells tend to display lower amounts of methylation across the entire genome but increased methylation at CpG islands. The loss of methylation across the genome decreases regulation, and the presence of methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Silencing of these genes allows cancerous tumors to develop more easily.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 and IGF2 complex provides an example of the function of imprinting. H19 is a maternal gene and IGF2 is a paternal gene.  These genes share enhancers, and their imprinting is determined by CTCF, which binds to ICR (imprinting control region) sites. On the paternal chromosome, methylation of the ICR prevents CTCF from binding, allowing IGF2 to interact with the enhancer, thereby allowing its expression, and is required for the methylation and silencing of H19. In the maternal IGF2R, the ICR contains a promoter that expresses ncRNA when unmethylated and represses it when methylated. The presence of the ncRNA represses cis-linked genes when it is expressed. Wilms’ tumor is associated with the loss of IGF2 imprinting. This loss can be caused by hypermethylation of IGF2 or H19, through the mechanism explained above. Loss of imprinting can alter the transcription of IGF2, which can lead to health problems.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug. This type of epigenetic drug can modify cancer cells in a way that makes them more susceptible to chemotherapy. Because it works through an epigenetic mechanism, decitabine is able to make changes in cancer cells that will be passed on to daughter cells unless they are actively removed. Azacitidine, another DNA-demethylating agent was tested in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor. The results of this experiment showed a decrease in growth rate of tumors. This is particularly notable because of the difficulty of treating solid tumors as compared to leukemia or lymphoma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changing DNA methylation can have a lasting impact on cells even after treatment is discontinued. This is because altering DNA methylation changes the epigenome, and these epigenetic markers are passed on from parent cells to daughter cells. Thus, decreasing methylation of certain genes, such as tumor suppressors will allow them to be expressed more in all subsequent generations unless the methylation is actively changed again. It would not be a good idea to treat a patient with demethylation drugs during a sensitive period. This is a time when epigenetic markers are especially susceptible to change by external factors, specifically the pre-implantation and germ cell development periods. Administering these drugs to a pregnant individual, for example, could have repercussions for the developing fetus. </p></div>
