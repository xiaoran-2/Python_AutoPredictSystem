    <h1>Submission 367 from Anon (session_user_id: 50c13b17dc95a964fbfc8e36296e2a20e638bafd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, an anti-tumor agent, is a DNA-demethylating agent that actively removes the methyl groups attached to DNA, altering one kind of epigenetic mark that regulates (often silencing) gene expression. Other anti-tumor drugs act by reducing the epigenome methylation state.  One such class of drugs targets <em>EZH2</em>, which when mutated (and overactive) in lymphomas hypermethylates histone proteins. The resulting abnormal gene silencing is believed to inhibit expression of tumour-suppressor genes, and experimental evidence confirmed that tumor proliferation and histone overmethylation declined in response to therapy by an EZH2-inhibitor. Therefore drugs that reduce the methylation state of the epigenome in other ways may also have anti-tumor effects.  Thus, Decitabine that directly reduces the methylation state of DNA (but not histones like the EZH2 inhibitor) might also reduce the ‘oversilencing’ of healthy genes such as tumor suppressors, permitting their normal expression and anti-tumor function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because of epigenomic heritability (epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division) and metastability (epigenetic clones of genetically identical cells, often through out the lifetimeof an individual). Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, are (typically) cleared during sensitive periods, including early development (from fertilization to epiblast stage), and primordial germ cell development (into mature gametes).  Epigenomic marks must be reprogrammed or reset during sensitive periods to ensure further normal development. While these periods are generally important for many genes, imprinted genes are only subject to epigenetic reprogramming during the latter period, and some normal genes (or genetic sequence types, such as repeat) and some abnormal genes are remembered or poorly cleared, even during these sensitive periods. </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be unwise because DNA methylation is globally low during sensitive periods, drugs that reduce DNA methylation might not be effective during these periods.  But more importantly, drugs that inhibit the resetting or restoration of DNA methylation that occurs during the sensitive periods could have drastically detrimental effects on normal genes whose activity is dependent on methylation state, potentially producing transgenerational effects, such as shown in mouse nutritional/drug studies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important component of epigenetic regulation that is altered (almost universally) as cancer progresses.  In normal cells, the DNA of CpG islands (CGI) is usually unmethylated, independent of gene activity state. However in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands (and their ‘shores’, or regions within 2 KB of CGI) tend to be hypermethylated, which is associated with gene silencing, where CGI shore hypermethylation may be a better predictor of expression than CGI hypermethylation. Silencing by CGI hypermethylation of 'cancer fighting' genes such as tumor suppressors contributes to cancerous disease, i.e., unregulated or abnormal growth of cells and tissues.  In some cancers, defined as CGI methylator phenotype (CIMP), whole sets of genes are hypermethylated and silenced. While CGI hypermethylation for many cancers, including some lung cancers, is often associated with increasing tumorigenicity, it is an indicator of good prognostic outcome for colorectal CIMPs.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic and repetitive elements, which comprise most of the genome, are often methylated. These gene body (versus promoter CGI) methylations are often present in highly expressed genes, and may serve normal, healthy functions such as repressing transcriptional noise from alternative start sites or inhibiting antisense transcription. However, these functions may be lost in cancer, where these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated.  Hypomethylation in repeats contributes to genomic instability which is evidenced as illegitimate recombination, the activation of repeats and transposons, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.</p>
<p>In summary, cancer-associated epigenetic alterations include genome-wide losses and regional gains in DNA methylation, which lead to deregulation of 'housekeeping', tissue-speciﬁc and imprinted genes, and widespread adverse effects of genomic instability. These alternations in DNA methylation provide mechanistic insight into the progressive nature of cancer, and serve as sensitive biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hyper- or hypo-methylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) can result in the loss of imprinting, which is defined as monoallelic, parent of origin gene expression.  Imprinted gene diseases result from changes that alter the expression of growth restricting and growth promoting genes, such as insulin-like growth factor 2 (<em>Igf2</em>) which has a stimulatory effect on growth. In normal patients,  only the paternal <em>Igf2</em> is expressed due to differentially methylated expression control.  More specifically, the paternal allele for the ICR for <em>Igf2</em> is methylated, permitting downstream <em>cis</em> enhancers to increase the expression of  paternal<em> </em><em> Igf2. </em>In contrast,<em> </em>the maternal ICR is unmethylated and can thus bind the CTCF insulator, permitting enhancers to increase the expression of <em>H19,</em> but not maternal <em>IgF2</em>.  In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal (like the paternal) allele for the ICR for <em>Igf2</em> is methylated, permitting downstream <em>cis</em> enhancers to increase the expression of  maternal as well as paternal<em> </em><em> Igf2</em>.  Thus, hypermethylation of the maternal IGR results in overexpression of the gene <em>Igf2</em>, i.e., by both maternal and paternal alleles.  This double dose of <em>Igf2</em> has a tumorogenic effect and is an early, preneoplastic change in this disease. </p></div>
