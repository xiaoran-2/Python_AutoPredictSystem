    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells show a genome-wide loss of methylation, but site-specific hypermethylation. <br /><br />In healthy systems, most CpG islands show low methylation levels, in order for the gene they promote to be expressed - a methylated CpG island means the gene is silenced. <br /><br />In cancer, specific regions like CpG islands (as well as the area surrounding them - CpG island shores) show hypermethylation. Various genes can be silenced, depending on the type of tumour. <br /><br />Hypermethylation of the CpG islands of promoters for tumor-suppressor genes induces a loss of ability of the system to fight the growth of tumour cells. <br />Genes responsible for cell cycle regulation can be affected by CpG hypermethylation, for instance allowing cancer cells to proliferate, or not undergo apoptosis, therefore enabling them to take over healthy tissue by being more "efficient" than normal cells. <br />Genes coding for DNA-repair proteins can be targeted, like with BRCA1 (breast cancer), limiting the ability of the system to defend itself. <br /><br />In contrast, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal systems. This methylation ensures genomic stability : it protects the DNA from deletions, insertions, translocations, illegitimate recombinations... Repeats also need to be silenced in order to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters.<br /><br />In cancer, we see a loss of methylation (hypomethylation) at intergenic regions and repeats, leading to genomic instability and the occurrence of the above disruptions -  general hypomethylation in cancer cells increases with the malignancy of the tumour. <br />Hypomethylation results from DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) being disrupted (DNMT1 knockout in mice was shown to result in genomic instability), and might promote tumour formation through the increase in DNA re-arrangement resulting from genomic instability, as well as chromosomal re-arrangement. <br />DNA hypomethylation was also shown to activate transposable elements or endogenous viruses. <br /> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2, Insulin Growth Factor 2, is subjected to genomic impring, i.e. is expressed in one allele and not the other: only the paternal allele expresses Igf2.<br /><br />On the h19/Igf2 cluster, two sites repress the expression of Igf2: CTCF is an insulator protein, which “protects” sites (Igf2) from being targeted by downstream enhancers; H19 is an enhancer blocker.<br /> <br />In normal cells, the maternal allele shows an active CTCF insulator protein (that is, the CTCF binding site is unmethylated) , which prevents activation of Igf2, while H19 is also unmethylated: Igf2 expression is then repressed. <br /><br />On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) blocks the binding of CTCF, and spreads to H19, inactivating it; it therefore allows the enhancers to reach Igf2 and activate its expression. <br /><br />In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting at this site: the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele, which then shows the same expression of Igf2 as the paternal on: CTCF and H19 cannot repress the expression of Igf2. <br />The resulting biallelic, therefore excessive, expression of Igf2, an oncogene, increases the growth of the affected cells, and enables proliferation of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent (or hypomethylating agent), a DNMT inhibitor: it binds to DNMT (DNA methyltransferase), preventing it from laying down DNA methylation and therefore allowing the expression of genes that would otherwise be repressed. <br /><br />Cancer cells show a higher-than-normal methylation level at the CpG islands of promoters for key genes  - see question 1 - and the use of a demethylation agent can help prevent the resulting pathological repression of gene expression. <br /><br />Decitabine can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which production of blood cells of the myeloid class is disrupted. In MDS, the genes coding for a controlled blood-cell renewal are hypermethylated, and the cells will proliferate - until abnormal cells reach a certain ratio to healthy ones, leading to acute myelogenous leukemia (AMS).  <br />Decitabine treatment can allow a regulation of the blood cells and the re-establishment of a normal blood count, preventing AMS.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, i.e. is maintained through cell division: if one of the strands of DNA is methylated, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) “recognizes” it and lays down methylation on the daughter strands, in effect copying the methylation pattern of the parent strand. <br /><br />This means that DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic state throughout the life of the organism (and even beyond, as it can be inherited).<br /><br />However, there are periods during which certain DNA methylation patterns are “cleared” for epigenetic reprogramming, called sensitive periods: they allow the cell to regain pluripotency, the ability to develop into various types of specific cells. <br /><br />The maternal genome cells undergo reprogramming at blastocyst and primordial germ cell development, while the paternal genome cells are reprogrammed during those two periods as well as during egg fertilization.<br />The epigenetic marks are then re-established. <br /><br />In the event of treatment with DNA demethylation agents, or any drug affecting DNA methylation, those periods would have to be avoided. It would be dangerous to treat pregnant women as the drug could interfere with the re-establishment of methylation marks.</p></div>
