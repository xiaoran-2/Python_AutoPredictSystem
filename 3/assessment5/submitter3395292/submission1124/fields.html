    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>A common feature of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting of parent-specific alleles; either both alleles are expressed, or they are both silenced. Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in cell growth, so disrupting them can cause uncontrolled tumour growth.</em></p>
<p><em>In normal cells, the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is hypermethylated, and hypomethylated on the maternal allele. This means that CTCF will bind to the ICR on the maternal allele, causing the enhancers to act on the H19 gene, while silencing the Igf2 gene as the CTCF acts as an insulator. Because the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and so the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene, but not H19.</em></p>
<p><em>When imprinting is lost, and both parent-specific alleles have methylated ICRs, it means that enhancers on both alleles can activate Igf2, resulting in over expression of Igf2 – a “double dose”. Igf2 is growth promoting, and so a double dose of it results in what’s known as Wilm’s tumour, which grows on the kidneys.</em><em></em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>CpG islands are unmethylated (hypomethylated) in normal cells, but more likely to be methylated (hypermethylated) in cancer cells. In normal cells, the intergenic regions, the repetitive elements and the introns of genes are methylated, but are unmethylated in cancer cells. The CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so when they are methylated, the gene is epigenetically silenced, cancerous tumour cells can grow. The silencing is mitotically heritable, so are the cancer cells replicate in the tumour, they all carry the silenced gene. 2 kb upstream and downstream from the methylated CpG islands, regions are also methylated, and these are called the CpG island shores.</em></p>
<p><em>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability, preventing deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations of genes. It also serves to silence cryptic splice sites.</em></p>
<p><em>If the repetitive elements and Intergenic regions are unmethylated, as they are in cancer cells, it can cause the genome to become unstable, resulting in illegitimate recombination between the repeats, as the repeats are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin. Hypomethylation of repeats can also cause them to activate, and transpose around the genome, disrupting activations throughout the genome. It is this genomic/chromosomal instability that causes cancer.</em></p>
<p><em>The Knudson hypothesis states that multiple ‘hits’ are needed to completely inactivate the tumour suppressor genes, are multiple alleles need to be ‘hit’ in order to completely silence the genes. Oncogenes also need to be activated by the epimutations. The cells with the most oncogenes activated and tumour suppressor genes silenced has a competitive advantage over the other cells, as they are less likely to die, and so will eventually make up the entire tumour.</em><em></em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means it decreases methylation of the DNA, including the tumour-suppressor genes. When these tumour-suppressor genes are unmethylated, they are activated, so they prevent the formation of cancerous tumours by directly preventing uncontrolled cell growth. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, meaning it is incorporating into the DNA of the daughter cells. It decreases methylation by binding to DNA methyltransferase enzymes, when they come to act on the section of DNA, and irreversibly binding to and therefore inhibiting them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a period during the stages of development where the environment is able to influence epigenetic control. In mammals, there are two major sensitive periods (but also organ and tissue-specific period, when there are brief windows when particular organs will be particularly sensitive), and they occur when the epigenome is being actively remodelled, meaning when the epigenetic marks are being removed and lain down. One of these is the period of primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm, and the other is the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. </p></div>
