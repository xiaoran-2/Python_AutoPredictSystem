    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In normal somatic cells CpG islands are generally unmetherlated while the intergenic zone and repetitive elements are commonly methelated. In cancer this arrangement me be turned on its head with methylation at the CpG islands, which may overlap into the CpG neighbourhoods, and demethalation in the intergnic and reptative elements.</span></p>
<div>In normal function most CpG islands are unmethalated, and are associated with gene promotors which are switched on. In cancer cells hypermethalation of CpG islands and CpG shores will switch off these promoters and is often associated with switching off tumour suppressors.</div>
<div>Conversely hypomethalation of repetitive elements can lead to genomic instability,resulting in deleting insertions and reciprocal translocations loss of regulation at imprinting control regions. In intergenic regions hypomethalation may result in inappropriate gene activation of oncogenes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<div>The process of imprinting specifically selects for one allele, either derived from the mother or father. The specific allele is selected by methylation of  imprint control regions. Incorrect methylation of these loci in cancer cells can result in over expression or under expression of genes within the cancerous cell.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An example of what happens when imprinting is overwritten in a cancer cell can be seen the H19/lgf2 cluster.</div>
<div>Within this cluster a CTCF binding site upstream of H19  is usually methylated in the paternal gene and unmethalated in the  maternal gene. Methylation at this CTCF site can easily spread down stream to the H19 loci and silence it allowing promoters to active lgf2. Lgf2 is growth promoting and is considered an oncogene </div>
<div>In cancer, in particular, Wilms tumour,  hypermethalation will result in deactivation of H19 in the maternal allele resulting in upregulation of lgf2, as both alleles would now capable of producing it, promoting unregulated growth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In normal development disregulation H19 to switch on both the maternal and paternal alleles would result in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>A common association of cancer is with silencing or suppression of tumor suppressor genes, indeed Tumor suppressor hypermethalation is more frequent than genetic mutations. Typically hypermethalation will occur around different clusters of CpG islands. The islands are often associated with gene promoters and methylation at these loci and their immediate neighbourhood result in gene suppression.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Decitabine is a drug which works by demethalating DNA, a process generally associated with switching genes on, in this particular case the targets are the cancer suppressed repair genes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Making this compound available within the cell it is believed that some of the adverse impact of DNA hypermethalation in cancer cells, particularly of CpG islands and CpG island shores can be ameliorated, thus limiting tumor growth by switching tumour suppressors back on. Fortunately epimutations are reversible and daughter cells may carry the new epigenetic changes which may be why some patients also show improved response to chemotherapy.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<div>The current crop of epigenetic drugs to target the methylation or demethalation of DNA are aimed at reversing the impact of hypometherlation of intergenic and repetative elements and hypermethalation of CpG islands and CpG island shores that often occur in cancerous cells.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Because the epigenetic DNA changes, (methalations or demethalations), are mitotically heritable, daughter cells may also carry the same epigenetic charges as their parent cell, if these changes can switch on tumour suppressors or switch off growth factors this will make it more difficult for the cancer and its daughter cells to survive subsequent chemotherapy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An important factor in tolerating these kinds of epigenetic drugs is to avoid using them in sensitive periods. These are periods of epigenetic rearrangement when </div></div>
