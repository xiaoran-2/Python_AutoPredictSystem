    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is found in the genome of diverse organisms including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. It is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group (-CH3) to DNA nucleotides cytosine and adenine and it is responsible for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation (XCI).</span></p>
<p><span>             In normal mammalian cells, the addition of the methyl group at carbon 5 of the cytosine base is like a general fact, approximately 70-80 % of CpG dinucleotides being methylated in somatic cells. In general, DNA methylation in promoter region is correlated with silencing gene expression. CpG islands tend to be the exception, because the high density of promoters (about 60%) are usually no methylated.</span></p>
<p><span>            Although, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated, that causes the silencing of gene expression. This type of epigenetic abnormality is critical when genes that regulate the cell system are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce with no control, leading to formation of tumors. Genes that are usually silenced due to hypermethylation include tumor suppressor gene and DNA repair gene.</span></p>
<p><span>           The other regions of the genome where do you find DNA methylation are intergenic regions and repetitive elements, that are in normal cells methylated. Intergenic regions are a stretch of DNA sequences located between genes. The function of DNA methylation in this regions is to maintain genomic integrity, cells that doesn’t display DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) are genomic instable, which can cause deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions in the chromosomes. Repetitive elements are patterns of DNA that have many copies throughout the genome. In normal cells, repeats tend to be also methylated. Their role is to maintain genomic integrity, silencing of repeats prevent transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and also illegitimate recombination of chromosomes.  </span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, in cancer cells the intergenic region and the repeats are more likely to be unmethylated.In other words, these regions tend to be hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, disrupting neighbouring genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal and paternal alleles can be either methylated or unmethylated depending on the imprinted gene.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the case of IGF-2/ H19 cluster of imprinted genes, the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. This means it’s paternally imprinted. </span>H19 is a long non-coding RNA which it’s produced just from the maternal allele.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">When the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF, an insulator protein, that insulates IGF-2 from downstream enhancers. Because it’s insulating IGF-2 , these enhancers are free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</span></p>
<p>On the paternal allele when ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer binding. If CTCF cannot be bound to ICR there is no insulator action then enhancers will act on IGF-2 and promote its expression from paternal allele.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In normal cells, the paternal IGF-2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal chromosome 11 reverses to a paternal epigenotype, methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF-2 expression is turned on and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, also known as Dacogen, is a drug developed for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), conditions where blood cells are dysfunctional.</p>
<p>The drug acts like a hypomethylating agent, it inhibits DNA metyltransferase by hypometylating the DNA strands. Unlike azacitidine, which can be incorporated into DNA and RNA strands, Decitabine can only be incorporated in DNA chains.</p>
<p>Decitabine reduces the proliferation of tumor cells while it seems to be no side effect on nearby normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can cause growth defects such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann overgrowth syndrome (BWS) and the Russell-Silver (RSS) intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation syndrome. These growth disorders are caused by abnormal DNA methylation.</p>
<p>There are two critical periods of epigenetic reprogramming: gametogenesis and early preimplantation development. Major reprogramming takes place in primordial germ cells, in which parental imprints are erased and totipotency is restored. Imprint marks are then re-established during spermatogenesis or oogenesis, depending on gender. Upon fertilization, genome-wide demethylation is followed by a wave of de novo methylation. Early embryogenesis is a critical period of epigenetic regulation, and is sensitive to environmental factors</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. “It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.” (2012, 7th April). <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. The Economist.</p></div>
