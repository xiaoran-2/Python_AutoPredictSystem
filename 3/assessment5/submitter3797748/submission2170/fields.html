    <div class="field-value"><p>The cytosine residues in the genome are prone to addition of a methyl group by a process known as DNA methylation, facilitated by the enzyme DNMT. Though cytosine residues at CpG islands usually dont allow methylation, but whenevr CpG islands are found to be methylated, it is associated with the silencing of the gene expression. The methylation pattern of CpG islands is critical for normal cell functioning hence any disturbance to this process might lead to aberrant cell functioning ultimately leading to a diseased condition. Any gene that has a role in critical life processes say glycolysis has to be tightly regulated. This form of control can be exerted by epigenetic mechanism such as DNA methylation. If a balance of the DNA methylation is not maintained, then the whole process might get impaired. </p>
<p>Unlike normal cells, the CpG islands of the cancerous cells tend to be hypermethylated while the other regions like the intergenic region, repetitive elements and the introns are found to be hypomethylated. For instance, the hypermethylation of a promoter might result in the over-expression of a micro-RNA which might indirectly affect the expression of the tumor suppressor genes (lowering its expression).</p>
<p>The methylation of intergenic regions and repeatative elements is crucial for the silencing of the events that could be a potential threat to the genome instability. These events include deletions or insertion of a particular region of a chromosome, duplication of a certainregion of chromosome or translocation of parts of chromosome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. The unmethylated ICR (Imprint Control Region) in the maternal allele allows the binding of an insulator protein called CTCF. This binding has the effect that the Igf2 is now masked from the action of enhancers. Hence, the enhancers now upregulates the expression of H19. However, in case of paternal allele, the methylated ICR forbids the CTCF from binding and hence the only option for the enhancers is the Igf2 thus enhancing its expression. </p>
<p>The Wilms tumor arises due to the loss of imprinting of Igf2 gene. Here, a patient recieves two copies of the chromosome form a single parent or a single chromosome from one parent and none from the other. This results in the overexpression of Igf2 protein which consequently gives rise to tumor in kidney.</p>
<p>In case of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, the finely tuned imprinting in Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters are disturbed. This disturbance leads to the overexpression of Igf2 (an oncogene) and at the same time decreases the expression of Cdkn1c (a tumor suppressor). The overall outcome is an increased preferance to the growth of cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a prodrug that shows its action during the S-phase of cell-division. Since it is a prodrug, it has to be converted into its active form with potential effects via a phosphorylation mechanism which is facilitated by the enzyme deoxcytidine kinase. Decitabine is a specific inhibitor of DNA methylation and hence upon its application, decitabine specifically inactivates the DNA methylating enzyme (DNA methyltransferases) which in turn facilitates the re-expression of the silent tumor suppressor genes and induces differentiation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The inheritable nature of the DNA methylation pattern during cell division from a mother cell to a daughter cell accounts for the fact that the drugs which alter the DNA methylation have effects even after the treatment with a drug. </p>
<p>Sensitive period, a period between the implantation of zygote and  the development of germ cell, is a very important phase during development. During this period, it is not advisable to treat patients with drugs that alter the DNA methylation pattern. The drugs that affects the DNA methylation if used during the sensitive period may significantly change the methylation patterns of other genes which are required for normal cell development. This might have detrimental effects on the cell differentiation as well.</p></div>
