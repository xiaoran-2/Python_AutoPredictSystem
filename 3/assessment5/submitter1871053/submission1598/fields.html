    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in two different ways in cancer and disease: DNA methylation is increased at CpG islands and decreased in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  To understand how these alterations contribute to cancer proliferation, we first need to understand the function of DNA methylation at these sites in normal cells.  DNA methylation leads to silencing by recruiting proteins that cause transcriptional repression as well as recruiting other chromatin condensing factors.  DNA methylation can also prohibit transcription factor binding.  CpG islands are normally unmethylated.  When they are methylated they lead to silencing of gene expression.  In cancerous cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands is often found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, which results in silencing of these genes.  Cells with this hypermethyation, then have high replication, this combined with the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, leads to selection for these cell lines.  It is thought that this combined with other aberrations, for example increased expression of oncogenes, results in further increased replication of cancerous cells.   In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.  This serves to maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic start and splice sites, silencing and mutating repeats to prevent transposition, as well as preventing illegitimate recombinations between repeats.  Hypomethylation in diseased and cancerous cells allows chromatin to be open, which can lead to illegitimate recombinations that produce reciprocal translocations insertions and deletions.  These abberations can lead to tumorogeneisis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat cancer by impacting the epigenetic processes involved in proliferating cancer cells.  It is a DNMT inhibitor.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNMT’s after being incorporated into DNA.  It is then dependent on replication to demethylate the DNA of future cells.  Due to the increased replication of tumor cells, it should have a greater impact on these cells than less replicated normal cells.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  While its mode of action is not completely known, as a demethylating agent, it is possible that its increased success in AML patients is due to demethylation of the hypermethylated CpG islands that seem particularly impactful in these patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects due to the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation.  Accordingly, there are certain sensitive periods of development during which you should avoid treating patients with such drugs.  Sensitive periods are times when the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in cells rather than maintained.  These periods occur during embryogenesis and gametogenesis.  After fertilization and prior to implantation the epigenetic marks are removed reaching a low at blatocyst stage.  They are slowly reestablished after this period.  Similiarly, around midgestation, in the formation of primordial germ cells, epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished according to the cell type.  Changes in DNA methylation during sensitive periods have been shown to have increased propensity to disease, so using drugs that effect DNA methylation during these periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting occurs by DNA methylation, and can act to either suppress or activate an allele.  Accordingly, disruptions of imprinting can contribute to cancer in different ways.  One example of how this occurs can be found in the H19/Igf2 cluster.  In the paternally imprinted allele, DNA is methylated at the ICR which blocks binding of the CTCF.  Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter effectively silencing H19.  The enhancers are then allowed activate the Igf2.  In the maternal allele, there is no methylation at the ICR, and CTCF is able to bind.  CTCF insulates the Igf2 from the enhancers downstream, and Igf2 is not expressed.  In Beckman Wiedemann Syndrome, there is a problem in the maternal transmission causing two paternal-like alleles of the H19/Igf2 cluster.  This causes upregulation and overdose of Igf2 expression.  Since Igf2 is an oncogene involved in growth promoting, an overdose of Igf2 leads to overgrowth as is the case in Wilm's Tumor.</p></div>
