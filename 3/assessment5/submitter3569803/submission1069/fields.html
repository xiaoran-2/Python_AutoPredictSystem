    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, while the rest of the genome is hypermethylated. Methylation at CpG islands is important to many different epigenetic processes. As stated, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated indedpendent of gene expression. However, DNA is hypermethylated in CpG islands in cancer. This hypermethylation tends to silence gene expression to genes such as tumor suppressor genes. Loss of methylation throughout the genome is one of the earliest abnormalities found in cancer. Typically intragenic regions and repeats show methylation. In cancer these repeats can become hypomethylated. This loss of methylation contributes to genomic instability causing recombinations and transpositions. They can also activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighboring genes. These problems can all contribute to the disease of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprint Control Region (ICR) CTCF is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In the maternal allele, the unmethylated CTCF will bind an insulator element, which then allows the enhancers to act on H19. This causes Igf2 to be silent, and you see no Igf2 expression. On the paternal allele, the methylated CTCF will not bind to the insulator element, therefore the enhancers then act on Igf2. The paternal allele then shows expression of Igf2. The loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation of CTCF. It becomes methylated on the maternal as well as paternal allele, and so you see increased expression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumor. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>`Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor or DMNTi. It irreversibly binds DNA methyl transferases (DMNTs) after they are incorporated into the DNA. This makes them replication dependent. As the dosage and time increase, the amount of DNA methylation decreases. As DMNTs become bound to the Decitabine, they can no longer trasfer the methyl groups onto the DNA. This causes a decrease in methylation. Decitabine has specifically worked well for hematological malignancies like AML. It is thought that this is because those tumors are dependent on hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, inhibiting their expression. DMNTi would cause hypomethylation instead, allowing these tumor suppressor genes to express their product and prevent tumors from developing. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes made by drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long term and lasting effects. This is because these epigenetic changes are heritable, and therefore they can be passed on to daughter cells. This allows for these changes to remain in place and can make other cancer treatments like chemotherapy more effective. However, there are some times where this sort of treatment requires great caution. There are sensitive periods for DNA methylation, and these are times when the methylation is wiped clean. The DNA is then remethylated. These two sensitive periods are very early in pre-embryonic development and in development of the primordial germ cells. Treating patients during these sensitive periods could cause more problems then help as that would direct the DNA methylation patterns in a way that could be abnormal. Additional concern is found in treating young patients who still have developing germ cells. They could still be sensitive to the epigenetic effects of these types of drugs, so great caution must be taken.</p>
