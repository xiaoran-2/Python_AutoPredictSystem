    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>In normal mammalian somatic cells the CpG islands in promotor regions are kept free  of methylation, independent of the activity state of the promotor. Promotor CpG islands of cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated which causes silencing of the underlying gene. It is thought that hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to the change from normal cells to cancer cells by silencing tumour supressor genes. In some tumourtypes hypermethylation of CpG islands can be used diagnostically as biomarker for cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast with CpG islands, intergenetic regions and repetitive elements of the genome of normal cells are often hypermethylated. It is found that progressive with tumourgenicity these regions become hypomethylated in cancer cells. Hypomethylated intergenetic regions and repeats are thought to cause genomic instability e.g. by illegitimate recombination between repeats and activation of cryptic promotors followed by disruption of  neighbouring genes.    </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>On the maternal chromosome the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypomethylated, enabling the maternal ICR to bind to CTCF protein. <span>This prevents the promoters located in the <em>Igf2</em> gene from interacting with the enhancers downstream of the <em>H19</em> gene, resulting in silencing of the <em>Igf2 </em>gene. On the the paternal chromosome the ICR is methylated, preventing binding of CTCF. This allows the enhancers to contact the promoters of the paternal <em>Igf2</em>, allowing the gene to be transcribed. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>In Beckwith-Wiedemann sydrome (BWS) the maternal allele of the <span style="font-size:medium;"><span>H19/Igf2 cluster is found to behave like the paternal allele, resulting in abnormal (increased) expression of the Igf2 gene. In some cases this is the result of hypermethylation of the maternal ICR, thus preventing the ICR to bind with CTCF protein. BWS is known to be associated with increased incidence of Wilm's tumour. Also primary Wilm's tumour (not associated with BWS) is frequently associated with hypermethylation of the maternal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster and increased levels of Igf2.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;"><span></span></span></p>
<p>So it could be that the growth promoting Igf2 protein has an oncogenic effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue DNMT-inhibitor. By inhibiting DNMT there is less methylation of DNA. It has an anti-tumour effect because decreased hypermethylation of CpG islands prevents silencing of tumour supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>After treatment with a DNMT-inhibitor the demethylated parts of the genome will stay demethylated when mitosis takes place, because only the duplicated parts of methylated DNA will be methylated by DNMT1. This way the effect of the DNMT-inhibitor will endure after ceasing drug administration.</p>
<p>The use of drugs that influence DNA methylation would be inadviced during sensitive periods, i.e. a time during development of an organism, when that organism is more sensitive to environmental influences than at other times during its life span.</p>
<p>For DNA methylation sensitive periods would be periods when normally changes in methylation take place, more specifically periods when extensive de-methylation of the genome is followed by methylation. Two such periods are the blastocyst fase of embryonic development and the period of development of primordial germ cells.</p></div>
