    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Decitabaine is a DNA demethylating agent, that is used in myelodysplastic syndrome or acute meyolid leukemia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Demethylating agents are nucleoside analogues that cause irreversible inhibition of Dnmt1 thus stopping the methylation process and causing fading out of hypermethylation that occurs in cancer cells, but are replication dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">"some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next."</p>
<p dir="ltr">The long lasting effect on tumor cells by these drugs is not scientifically proven, however, the possibility exists still.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Changing the epigenetic state of a cell can have enduring effects on the epigenome since epigenetic modifications are passed or mitotically heritable, but this is of course after the cell has reached the maintenance phase of the epigenome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The mitotic heredibility of these modifications depends on the time of treatment, since it must be in a period other than the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These are periods during which there's removal of epigenetic marks in order to restore plurypotency and then these marks are laid back again, These periods occur at pre implantation and mid-gestation embryos.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Treating patients in these periods however won't be of effect since the whole epigenome is still re constructed and thus any changes made upon it would not have effect nor be heritable as it will be laid back again after differentiation.</p></div>
