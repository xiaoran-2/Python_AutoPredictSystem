    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Function of DNA methylation  at CpG islands. include regulating: gene expresion, chromatin remodeling, chromosome inactivation,imprinting, embryonic development and genome stability</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">In cancer alterations observed at CpG islands include locus specific hypermethylation at intergenic regions , e.g.,  tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and silenced as a consequence but it does vary by tumor types with respect to the set of tumor suppressor genes which are inactivated.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Differential epigenetic gene repression, or abnormal activation of genes, genome instability, which includes such chromosomal events such as translocations, deletions,duplications and  insertions </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">The normal function of DNA in intergenic regions is to protect against illegitimate recombination events and silence cryptic splice and transcription sites. DNA methylation in repetitive elements it silencing of repeats to avoid transposition, transcriptional interference of strong promoters, and aid in genome stability.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">In cancer DNA methylation is hypermethylated in intergenic regions but hypomethylated in repetitive elements</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Alterations of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive eleemnts can affect how genes are arranged and regulated. For example translocation events can disupt the gene seqeunce and/or alter the expression patterns, gene dosage problems can arise when amplication (duplication) events occur or the abrogation of many different types of gene functions via chromosomal deletions. In addition, cryptic promoters can be activated and disrupt the expression of other genes which reside within its proximity.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;"><span>The insulin-like growth factor 2</span> (IGF2) is part of a cluster of genes  which are regulated by genomic imprinting.  which  include the imprinting control center  (ICR), H19 (resides in the ICR, <span>a long non-coding RNA) whose function is not completely understood</span>), CTF (transcription factor) and enhancers . </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">In the maternal copy, the ICR is not methylated thus CTF binds to the  ICR which prevents enhancers from activating IGF2 (silenced) but allows the  expression of H19. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated this CTF can not bind to the ICR thus H19 is silenced. The enhancers bind to the IGF2 gene which is no active (gene is expressed)</span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">The IGF2  gene  functions in regulating promotes growth and division (proliferation) of cells in many different tissues. Normally, the IGF2 gene undergoes genomic imprinting thus its concentration is regulated. In Wilm's cancers, biallelic IGF2 expression (the paternal and the maternal copies) occurs  (due to loss of imprinting) thus increasing the amount of IGF2  produced by the cell.  Unless there are compensatory pathways which can modulate the biological consequences of the overexpression of IGF the threat  is unregulated cell growth leading to diseases such as cancer and/or growth disorders</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Decitabine belongs to a class of  DNA-demethylating agents. It is a nucleic acid analog of cytidine. DNA polymerases can incorporate Decitabine as in place of cytosine during replication. The consequence is that Decitabine resides in the DNA can not be methylated by DNA methyltransferases  resulting in hypomethylation. By reducing or eliminating the amount of hypermethylation in tumor suppressor regions  will reduce or abrogate transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes which were once silenced can now function in regulating cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">One key problem  in drugs which modulate DNA methylation is the lack of specificity to target the regions of genes and cell types desired. Altering methylation genome in a global manner will impact  the expression of many different genes (up or down regulation) thus there exists the potential for  inducing unknown side effects or other undesired biological outcomes.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Epigenetic sensitive periods refer to times of development when epigenetic marks are cleared by DNA hypomethylation and reset by DNA hypermethylation. This reprogramming of epigenetic marks is likely to be required for proper embryonic gene expression, totipotency, and  early lineage development in the embryo</span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Sensitive periods of DNA methylation include early embryonic development (blastocyst) and in mid-gestation embryo. During this period "reprogramming" i.e., clearing of epigenetic marks occurs. Resetting of epigenetic marks will occur during primordial  germ and germ cell development </span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-size:large;">Treament during sensitive periods can  lead to disruption of genomic imprinting and result in biallelic  expression and over expression of protein. Other possible biological consequences up or down-regulation of gene products, and chromosomal abnormalities all of which have the potential to cause health disorders.</span></p></div>
