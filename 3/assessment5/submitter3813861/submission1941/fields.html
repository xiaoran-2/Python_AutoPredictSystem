    <h1>Submission 1941 from Anon (session_user_id: 7a73131a4dec2145a8eca1cd644d80f03ee26d69)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the expression of that gene.  When a gene is methylated it is turned off so that it is not being expressed.  DNA methylation in CpG islands in cancer silence tumor suppressor genes or activate oncogenes. DNA methtylation can be used as a biomarker to detect disease and how that patient will respond to medicine and or therapies for that disease.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to be methylated and to silence those regions.  When those regions become unmethylated they are often associated with cancer or disease.</p>
<p>When methylation is removed from intergenic regions  this allows the DNA to change into euchromatin allowing for genomic instability such as deletions, insertions and translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern on the paternal allele is methylated so the CTCF cannot bind to the insulator element allowining the enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene and allow it to be expressed.  If the maternal allele is unmethylated the CTCF can bind and the enhancer is blocked from acting on the igf2 gene and it is not expresses.  In the wilm’s tumor the maternal allele is not methylated and also expressed so that you have twice the dose of the Igf2 gene.  When the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted the cells are allowed to grow without regulation causing disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug.  Tumor suppressors can become methylated in the genome causing them to not be expressed leading the cells to divide rapidly without being checked.  This drug can then remove the methylation of those genes there by allowing the gene to be expressed and make sure that the cells do not divide unchecked.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation can leave the cells responsive to other treatments such as chemotherapy.  Sensitive periods are when the epigenetic information is being reprogrammed during germ cell development and early embryonic development.  If a patient was treated during these times the epigenetic markers will not be passed down properly and the state of methylation may be incorrect leading to incorrect gene regulation. </p></div>
