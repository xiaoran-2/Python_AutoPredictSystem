    <div class="field-value"><p> Cancer cells exhibit a different DNA methylation pattern than normal cells in both CpG islands as well as in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p> CpG islands are DNA regions located near gene promoters which contain many CpG dinucleotides. Their methylation leads to silencing of the nearby gene. Normally CpG islands are mostly unmethylated, except of some small subsets depending on the cell type. Cancer cells however exhibit a hypermethylation of these islands therefore leading to silencing of many genes that are expressed under normal conditions. Methylation of CpG islands near tumour supressor genes leads to loss of the respective protein, in a similar way with a mutation, providing one of the multiple hits that are necessary for cancer development. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable tumour cells with silenced supressors will multiply faster and therefore be strongly selected. Different types of cancer exhibit hypermethylation of specific CpG sets.</p>
<p> In contrast to CpG islands intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in healthy cells preventing translocations, illegitimate recombinations or transpositions. The methylation of these DNA regions is therefore essential for the genome integrity of a cell. Cancer cells are usually hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Hypomethylation of these regions is associated with genomic instability via translocations, activation and transposition of repetitive elements, activation of cryptic promoters  etc. All these events lead to major genetic changes which in turn contribute to the development of cancer. In some cases hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters may even directly lead to activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p> While the main concept of CpG islands hypermethylation and genome-wide hypomethylation is the same in all cancer cells, the specific regions and the contibution of DNA methylation varies between cancer type and stage.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Imprinting Control Regions usually involve growth promoting or supressing genes and therefore the loss of their imprinting often leads to cancer. ICRs can either become hypo- or hypermethylated, expressing or silencing both alleles. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster normally only the paternal allele is methylated. The unmethylated maternal allele allows the binding of CTCF protein which insulates the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers. When Igf2 is insulated the enhancers act on H19 promoting its expression. The methylation of the paternal allele in contrast doesn't allow the binding of CTCF to the region. The enhancers act on Igf2 which is expressed. Furthermore the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter silencing it. In Wilm's tumour, which is a child kidney tumour, the H19/Igf2 cluster gets hypermethylated. Both alleles are methylated, blocking the binding of CTCF. The enhancers in both alleles are free to act on Igf2 which is expressed in the double dose than in normal cells. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting factor, the overexpression of its gene leads to tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention and are therefore open to drug treatment. Decitabine is an epigenetic drug which belongs to the class of DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). DNMTis are nucleoside analogues which lead to the irreversible binding of the DNA methyltransferases on them. In high doses they are toxic, however in lower doses they act as division dependent demethylating agents. Since cancer cells divide rapidly they are at most susceptible to these drugs. Decitabine is mostly effective in myelodysplastic syndrome cases, which is a cancer type highly dependend on CpG islands hypermethylation. The demethylation caused by the drug has therefore an anti-tumour effect. DNMTis may also affect cancer cells through other unresolved mechanisms.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, which means that they get passed on to daughter cells through cell division. This suggests that alterations in DNA methylation caused by drugs will persist beyond the period of drug treatment passed on to the offsprings of the cell that initially received the treatment. This is why drug treatment should be avoided during sensitive periods, periods during which altered environments have a major effect on epigenetic control. These periods in humans include the primordial germ cell development period and the pre- and early post-implantation period. Treating patients during these periods should be avoided since the precision of the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs during the sensitive periods is vital for both the patient and his/her offsprings. Epigenetic drugs influence not only the cancer cells but the whole system and can therefore lead to an incorrect epigenetic modelling when used during sensitive periods. Furthermore any mistakes caused during these periods will be passed on mitotically or even meiotically.</p></div>
