    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential for a number of processes and is present in around 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides of mammals. It is involved in genomic imprinting, chromossome X-inactivation and carcinogenesis. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to acquire abnormal hypermethylation and subsequent silencing of gene expression. Firstly, methylation of DNA results simply in blocking physically the promoter of a specific gene to bind in the initiation sequence. Secondly, it can act by recruiting Methyl-binding-proteins, which recruit additional proteins, e.g. histone acetylases and/or chromatin remodellers, modifying the histones and thereby promoting the locus to be as inactive chromatin, heterochromatin. In case of lost of these regulation, genes involved in cancer and other diseases that should be kept methylated and then silenced, may be expressed and develop abnormalities. Differently from CpG islands, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, to maintain genomic stability an integrity, e.g., to silence repeats (avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters). In cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, by the other hand intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated promoting genomic instability. The genomic instability, such as deletions, translocations and insertions are resulted from unmethylation state of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of enhancer blocking. In the maternal allele an unmethylated imprinting control region (ICR) promotes the binding of an insulator protein named CTCF that insulates Igf2 and then permits the expression of H19. Inversely, in the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the CTCF is no longer able to bind, resulting in the free action of enhancers to express the Igf2. If someone end up with two paternal alleles (uniparental disomy or mutation/deletion to cause loss of imprinting), there will not have Cdkn1c (tumour and growth suppressor) expression and there will appear an overdose of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoter) and predispose the individuals to develop Wilm's tumour but not adult tumours. Then many imprinted genes are involved in growth and the lost of these ICR may develop cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the <span>DNA-methyltransferases inhibitors class and are used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. This drug acts as a nucleoside analogue, and then when the DNMT1 comes to bind, the methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and is no longer released and is dependent of replication of DNA. Then as tumour is in rapid replication it can have anti-neoplastic effect when used in optimal doses. The problem is that there is a lack of specificity since this drug may act in every cell that at some time will divide/replicate.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are heredity passed through the dividing cells and generations, ending up in a favorable state without needing to kill every cancer cells with chemotherapy. Epidemiological and experimental studies show that there are sensitive periods both in humans and animals, which respond to stressful insults, either diets or drugs. Gestation and lactation are both specially important periods of development in which we have a high establishment of neural connections and epigenetic patterns. Similar to drugs, unbalanced diets consumed during these sensitive periods may promote the individuals to differential epigenetic imprinting and predispose them to develop diseases later in life. For example, supplementation of diets with folic acid is observed to prevent some diseases, which may be acting through an epigenetic mechanism, since folic acid is a methyl donor. However it may be used with care since it can promote adverse results.</p></div>
