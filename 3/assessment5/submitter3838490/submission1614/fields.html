    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in a promoter of a gene provide it is silenceing in normal. That occur because appropriated enzimes can not bind to methylated sites. CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer as a result of deregulation of DNA-methyltransferases and other regulatory enzimes. Hypermethylation at CpG provide silencing of tumor suppressor genes that results in tumorogenesis for instance hypermethylation of BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is require for transcriptional silencing of repeats and as a result maintaining genomic stability. These domain hypomethylated in case of cancer. Hypomethylated transposons is active and provide genomic instability (deletion, reciprocal translocation, insertion and duplication of chromosomes). Hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters induce oncogenes activation that like  transposons activity contributes to tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele ICR is methylated becфuse of this CTCF can not bind to this site. Therefore lgf2 is express intermediary enhancer activation. Otherwise in maternal allele here  ICR is unmethylated and CTCF bind to this site and prevent activation of lgf2 but instead enhancers allow to express H19. In cancer both imprinted alleles behave in the same way (both active or inactive). In Wilm's tumor maternal allele behave like paternal. Because of ICR hypermethylation igf2 is overexpressed instead of H19 that is not expressed. It is cause loss of imprinting and observing in pre-neoplastic tissue. Igf2 involve in growth and behave like oncogene while overexpress. In this case igf2 causing tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belong to class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine inhibit DNA-methyltransferases activity because of this level of methylation is decrease and tumor suppressor genes become active. Decitabine is also induce cell differentiation and rapid aging lead to block in mitosis that suppress tumorogenesis.<br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenome is very sensitive sistem. It is must has particular epigenetic mark in appropriate place to work correctly. If methylation or other epigenetic marks establish in wrong way the cell will die or become tumor-cell. Influence on epigenetic make up essentially important in sensitive period which is a period of reestablishing of epigenetic marks. In human ontogenesis there is two sensitive period - early embrionic development and pre-germ cells development. Because of inheritance epigenetic marks like methylation in somatic tissue disorder of this process in sensitive period causing by a lot of methyl donors for example will have dramatic aftermath for organism. Because of this treatment a patient by epigenetic drugs when his pre-germ cells developed can induce aberrant changes in his children.</p></div>
