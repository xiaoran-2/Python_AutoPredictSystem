    <h1>Submission 853 from Anon (session_user_id: 32379bd4b88304a38f372ee39363240e3dc5dd32)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has lasting effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable (i.e it is passed down to daughter cells during cell division). In this sense, targeting cancer cells with epigenetic drugs can prove effective because the epigentic changes in the cancer cell will be passed on to their progenry. This holds great promise in terms of treatment because uncontrolled cell division is a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those time frames of development when the organism is especially sensitive to certain changes. Such sensitive periods in epigenetic development are the very early periods of embryonic development and later postnatal periods during germ cell development (i.e. the production and maturation of sperm cells and female eggs). Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during germ cell development is inadvisable because this will result in epigenetic changes being laid down in the sperm cells and eggs. These changes in turn will be passed down on to the patient's children and can potentially have adverse effects (e.g. during early embryonic development). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation accurs at about 70% of CpG dinucleotides and is generally associated with gene silencing. There are, however, CpG islands throughout the genome that are generally not methylated. These CpG islands can be hypemethylated (that is, have their methylation increased) and thus silence the genes situated in the area (or nearby areas). The hypermethylation of CpG islands is related to cancer because there are tumor-supressor genes throught the genome that watch out for cells that divide uncontrolably and use molecular mechanisms to stop them. When these genes are silenced, however, tumor cells can rapidly divide because they are not controlled by the tumor-supressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is also normally found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. While there is a lesser number of sites where epigenetic marks can bind in those regions, they are nonetheless crucial for maintaining genomic stability. For example, repetitive elements can be silenced so that they don't interact with other genes or disrupt other molecular pathways. However, a hypomethylation of these repetitive elements and intergenic regions have been found in many cancer types (albeit to a different degree). When these repetitive elements are demethylated (and thus activated), they can interact with other genes and bring about genomic instability in the cell. This genomic instability can then give rise to genetic mutations and other unfavorable outcomes for the cell. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that inhibits DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT), the enzyme that lays down DNA methylation. The drug itself can be used to reduce the hypermethylation that occurs at some CpG islands in cancer cells and thus reduce (or slow down) the proliferation of cancer cells. Because DNA hypermethylation is specific for certain cancer types and silences growth-supressor genes, DNMT inhibitors can be used to slow down the methylation of those regions associated with cancer. This inhibiting process has to be carried out in a tissue-specific manner because healthy cells can be adversely affected by changing patterns of DNA methylation.</p></div>
