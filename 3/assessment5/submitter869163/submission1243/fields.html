<p>Usually DNA methylation of promoter regions opposite with gene expression. Generally, in normal cell at CpG islands we don’t see methylation in other words we have hypomethylation. In contrast, at a cancer cell, CpG islands more probability to be methylated than in normal cell. CpG islands have to be hypermethylation. CpG islands are found in the tumor suppressor genes’ promoters in normal cells. DNA methylation Changes in CpG islands in cancer cell lead to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. These changes can be genetically or epigenetically via silencing the tumor suppressor gene via locking in acyl in active state. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This CpG island hypermethylation associated with gene silencing, occurs really frequently in tumors.</p>
<p>In opposite of CpG island, in repetitive elements, and intergenic elements find that the genome in general is methylated in normal cell. But in cancer cell these regions indeed intron are hypomethylated, that means less methylation. These hypomethylation has an outcome depending on where it's happening. It beseems to happen early in tumorigenesis and progresses with time. The consequence of hypermethylation of repeats or indeed intergenic intervals are unlawful recombination between repeats. But in cancer we have high promethylation of these repetative elements or the intergenic regions. They align, they misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can occur because they are not densely packaged down into hetero-chromes. Because of the hypomethylation the repeats can also be activated. This can result in consequent problems where they jump into because of course they may disrupt the coding region of a gene but it also may activate neighboring genes. When we have hypomethylation of the repeats then they jump or they just have their promoters becoming active, then this can lead to transcriptional deviation in the circumambient areas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region is methylated on paternal allele, the enhancers acting on IGF2 and IGF2 is expressed because CTCF is not binding to insulator. On the maternal allele because imprint control region is unmethylated, CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, the enhancers will act on H19 but IGF2 will be silent. So in maternal allele we havn’t IGF2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour have growth promoting, because on the maternal allele we have loss of imprinting and high permethylation of the imprint control region as a result we also have igf2 expression. As a consequence we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to normal cell.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation or hypomethylation events can contributed to tumor types. maybe these events at the imprint control regions. Loss of imprinting is seeing in wide range of tumor types. Either they're growth promoting or growth suppressing. It’s often seen in pre neoplastic tissues In fact, happen as a very early event. We would actually determine that it really was a frank tumor.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-88ccf08ca331951e6a6e8454/970238/asst-5/970238-5211168ddd3404.14044509.pdf">Answer 2.pdf</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine appertain to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors class. That approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome. So they get combine into the DNA on replication, then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. Action of these DNMT1 inhibitors is division dependent and we have to have the cell replicating. Cancer cells are dividing more quickly than other cells in the body will be more affected because they're replicating more. In the 70s they were using DNMT1 inhibitors with very high dosages and in that dosages they're toxic really. Instead, recently, they've been used at much lower doses and we have good anti-neoplastic effect, we are killing the tumor cells.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-88ccf08ca331951e6a6e8454/970238/asst-5/970238-5211aa85ac4315.00636929.pdf">Answer 3.pdf</a></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation fundamental block or promote the binding of transcriptional regulators and to the gene, DNA methylation chip in the organization of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modifications such as the histone code, noncoding RNA, nucleosome positioning, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins. This combinatory effect of DNA methylation affects gene expression and it can be mitotically inherited.</p>
<p>Sensitive period define when surrounding may be capable to influence epigenetic makeup. Two periods in development are actually sensitive to epigenetic control. The period of primordial germ cell development all the way via to the production of mature sperms and eggs seems to be one sensitive period. The other sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period. On both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>Treating patient in sensitive period would be harmful because it can be interfere with epigenetic reprogramming and might outcome in an incomplete epigenetic reprogramming or set of wrong epigenetic marks. It does contribute that permanent effect on germ cell development and early embryonic development. These changes in epigenetic makeup can be transfer to next generation.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-88ccf08ca331951e6a6e8454/970238/asst-5/970238-521316fda421a5.20872590.pdf">Answer 4.pdf</a></p></div>
