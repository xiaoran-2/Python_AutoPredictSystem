    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group at the cytosines of the DNA. This occurs at CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing because the DNA methylation at the CpGs keep transcriptional factors from binding. Furthermore the methylated CpGs can be bound by CpG binding proteins such as MeCP1 and MeCP2. These binding proteins have a DNA binding domain/transcriptional repressive domain, which keeps genes from being activated. Additionally, MeCP1 and MeCP2 can carry proteins which condense the chromatin structure. CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells. </span>In cancer CGI hypermethylation occurs. So more genes at CpG islands are methylated than in normal cells. CpG islands are located in the tumour suppressor gene promoters and if in cancer these CpG islands are silenced, then the tumour suppressor genes are also silenced causing cancer. This gives cancer cell the ability to multiply and divide indefinitely.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Most of the DNA methylation happens at intergenic intervals and repetitive elements. At intergenic regions the DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity. Genomic stability is crucial since it keeps from deletions, duplications, etc. of the genes. There DNA methylation also acts as a silencer for cryptic promoters. Silencing repeats has is similar functions because it avoids transcriptional interference. Methylating the repeats keeps from illegitimate recombinations to occur. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>In cancer it is exactly the DNA methylation gone wrong. The repeats and intergenic intervals in a normal cell are hypermethylated. On the other hand, cancer cells are hypomethylated at these regios. So cancer has high genomic instability and illegitimate recombinations occurring. The unmethylated repeats can make a copy of themselves transpose and move throughout the genome. This has very negative consequences because it disrupts normal coding regions or it activates neighboring genes that shouldn’t be active.</span>The transcriptional aberrations which result in genomic instability cause cancer to occur, because the normal transcription of genes is disrupted and the cell can’t function the way it does when it is under healthy conditions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>H19/Igf2 is an imprinted gene that is parent of origin mono-allelic responsible for growth, or in the case of cancer, overgrowth. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>Normally, the paternal allele of the gene is methylated making it a paternally imprinted gene. The downstream enhancers then act of the Igf2 and enhance its expression from the maternal allele. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>On the maternal gene, there is no methylation so it is bound by the CTCF protein. The CTCF insulates IGF2 from the enhancers acting on it. Because of protein loopin the enhancers act on the H19 long non-coding RNA and express it from the maternal gene. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span">        </span>When loss of DNA imprint methylation occurs it causes the loss of imprinting in a gene. So, if the maternal allele is now methylated the enhancers are able to promote Igf2 expression and because, as mentioned before, Igf2 is responsible for growth, an overexpression of course can cause loss of geno suppress genes. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Naturally, the failure to regulate growth is what result into the formation of a tumour and the growth of the cells, which not only happens in Wilm’s tumour, but in a variety of additional cancers as well.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>According to the Economist Article “Cancer’s Epicentre” decitabine, more commonly referred to as Dacogen as its trade name, is a DNA-demethylating agent. Just as its name might suggest, decitabine decreases DNA methylation within the cell. Cancerous or tumour cells are hypermethylated at CpG islands and hypomethylated at repeats. The hypermethylation can cause the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, but if Decitabine can inhibit the hypermethylation to occur, it will inhibit the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. The way that Decitabine might work is via inhibiting DNA methyltransferases “</span><span>causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or </span><a href="http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11287"><span>apoptosis</span></a><span>” (</span><a href="http://www.rxlist.com/dacogen-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm"><span>http://www.rxlist.com/dacogen-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm</span></a><span>). </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The antineoplastic effects are therefore clear: it keeps the cells from indefinitely dividing. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. If some of the wrongly modified DNA methylation causing cancer is changed in a way that it does not completely kill the cancer cell, it still might be able to bring about some changes that aid the medicine in destroying the cell. And as the cancer cells rapidly divide, the changed epigenome will be inherited by all the other cells also making the tumour more susceptible to drugs. During a sensitive period changes are happening in the epigenetics of a cell and they are sensitive to modification that may or may not be beneficial for the organism. Sensitive periods usually are during the pre-implantation development and germ cell development. In these time interval epigenetic cell reprogramming is taking place and the cells are very (as the name might suggest) sensitive to any other kind of modifications. During times of germ cell development it is very inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that might alter the epigenetic state, since these changes will then most likely be passed onto the next generation and affect it in a negative way. </span></p></div>
