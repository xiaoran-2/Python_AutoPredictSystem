    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs upon CpG dinucleotudes through the actions of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which add a methyl group to the 5<sup>th</sup> carbon of cytosine as a means of regulating gene expression in a variety of genomic regions. Clusters of CpG dinucleotides can be found in CpG islands, usually within promoters, and are usually found unmethylated to facilitate transcription. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually found methylated, which functions to maintain genomic integrity and stability via silencing expression. Silencing intergenic regions disallows transcriptional abnormalities while silencing repetitive elements disallows transposition of long terminal repeats (LTRs), which prevents illegitimate recombination and insertion within, and misexppression of, vital genes. In this way, DNA methylation functions to establish and maintain genomic stability, as such abnormal DNA methylation can promote genomic instability and therefore the initiation and/or progression of diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p>The knudson hypothesis states that multiple mutations are required to produce cancerous hallmarks such as increased proliferation and cell growth, thus allowing the initiation of carcinogenesis. These hallmarks can be attained by downregulating the expression of anti-cancer tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) and/or increasing the expression of tumour promoting oncogenes. Epimutations, in the form of abnormal DNA methylation, can promote carcinogenesis in such a way. These epimutations have been observed in the TSG RBs CpG island where hypermethylation takes place causing gene silencing and deregulation of cell growth in retinoblastoma. Hypomethylation is commonly found in repeats and intergenic regions which promotes LTR transposition and illegitimate recombination, increasing the danger of inactivating TSGs and encouraging genomic instability. These states of abnormal methylation are not restricted to these specific examples, rather, genome wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation is found at the CpG islands and repeats/intergenic regions respectively. This allows for many TSGs to be misregulated and promote carcinogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at the imprinting control region (ICR) established during primordial cell development which allows for parent-of-origin specific allele expression of the offspring. Normally, at the ICR of the H19/IGF2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated while the maternal allele is unmethylated. This means the maternal alleles ICR is bound by an insulator protein, CTCF, which disallows the upstream enhancer to access and activate igf2 expression, but as the H19 gene is not methylated the enhancer can bind to its promoter and facilitate its expression and functions to further suppress igf2 expression. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and spreads to H19, this inhibits both CTCF binding and H19 expression, and allows the enhancer to access by looping and activate igf2 expression. If a selection of mutations on the maternal allele arises then this will cause the ICR of H19/igf2 to be methylated and mimic the paternal allele. This means that igf2 expression will be increased 2-fold, this causes it to act as an oncogene which increases cell growth, while silencing the expression of the potential tumour suppressor gene H19 resulting in a predisposition to wilm’s tumour. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a small molecule inhibitor cytidine analog that has recently been approved for Myelodysplastic Syndrome progression to andacute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment and in an appropriate dosage functions by incorporating itself into DNA allowing the irreversible binding to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in a DNA replication and cell division dependent manner, thus inhibiting their ability to methylate CpG dinucleotides. Although the mode of action of the DNMT inhibitor Decitabine is still unclear, it is thought to relieve tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) CpG islands of their hypermethylated state in the AML affected cells epigenome and when these cells divide the hypomethylated state of the TSG CpG islands by decitabine are maintained, resulting in a non-cancerous haematological cell population. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to DNA methylation via drugs can be sustainable through cell division. After DNA replication DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation marks by using the template strand as a guide for laying down methylation marks upon the daughter strand to produce methylation symmetry between the strands, allowing any changes in DNA methylation to be maintained. These epigenetic marks can also be passed on from one generation to the next. However, there are two sensitive periods during epigenetic reprogramming where alterations to DNA methylation by the environment can have detrimental effects upon the patients offspring: during early embryogenesis and during gametogenesis, when the clearance and re-establishment of DNA methylation occurs.</p>
<p> The environment has been shown to affect offspring during the Dutch famine where low nutrition in peri-conceptional women resulted in increased obesity and cardiovascular disorders in their offspring compared to non-famine affected woman, due to a change in DNA methylation at some imprinted genes. Similar DNA methylation changes have been found during the Overkalix cohort where increased food supply during PGC development resulted in grandchildren with increased cardiovascular disorder risk and decreased lifespan. These instances both suggest that DNA methylation altering drugs should not be administrated during these sensitive periods. </p></div>
