    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two major alterations of the methylation levels that are found in the DNA of cancer cells. DNA methylation at CpG islands tend to be associated with gene silencing; in normal cells the CpG islands are usually not methylated, while in cancer cells they tend to be found hypermethylated. This disruption of methylation at CpG islands may be associated with the silencing of tumor suppressors genes; epigenetics changes like this can happen drastically and are easily perpetuated throughout the cells and through cells divisions, what associated with mutations in the genome, disruption of others epigenetic factors or activation of oncogenes may easily lead to tumors. The methylation in intergenic regions is believed to be responsible for maintenance of genomic integrity and stability. Almost with the same function, but acting on others kinds of structures and interactions between elements of the genome, the methylation of repetitive elements is also believed to be associated with maintenance of integrity and stability of the genome, but in this case it is because the silencing of repeats avoid mutations, transpositions, illegitimate recombinations and interferences from strong promoters. The disruption of this kinds of methylations happens with the hypomethylation of those elements, what tend to promote illegitimate recombinations and activations and transpositions of genes that are not supposed to occur in a health configuration of the genome, what may lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is incorporated into the DNA and prevents the DNMT from perpetuating the methylation along the cells divisions. When the DNMT comes to act, they bind irreversible at the DNMTi no longer promoting the methylation of that specific region of the DNA; since the DNMT bound and no longer act along the cells divisions, this makes the methylation to decrease along the replication of the DNA, what in tumor cells act inhibiting and preventing its growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of DNA methylation may be permanent due to the way the alteration is enabled. Modifying the methylation marks may alter genes expression and the expression of others epigenetic factors, what can endure even after the removal of the drug that promoted the initial alteration. There are some periods called sensitive periods when a tiny modification in the process that are occurring may have great impact in the final result of the cells e tissues formation, like when you have the epigenetic reprograming in the primordial germ cells or at the pre-implantation period, in the early embryonic development. Promoting alteration in the epigenetic at those periods may disrupt completely the formation of the organism, promoting genetic malfunctions or malformations that even may make life impossible to occur. Those mechanisms are helpful because they enable drug treatments, but they are also risky, due to the importance and broadness of those elements, so any disruption may lead to huge unwanted consequences.</p></div>
