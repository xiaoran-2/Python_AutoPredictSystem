    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation – the methylation of cytosine within CpG dinucleotides - is a key category of epigenetic modification. It can occur at several locations: at CpG “islands”, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  </p>
<p>CpG dinucleotides frequently occur in clusters called “CpG islands”, often located in gene promoter regions. CpG islands are normally kept free of methylation. When it does occur, methylation at CpG islands in promoters typically leads to silencing the expression of the corresponding genes, via mechanisms such as formation of repressive chromatic structures, or prohibition of transcription factor binding. In normal cells of female mammals, however, as part of an epigenetic dosage compensation mechanism, CpG islands in the inactive X chromosome are methylated, and this epigenetic state is mitotically inherited by daughter cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, in contrast, CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes show high levels of methylation. This silences the tumor suppression genes, and since the hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and confers a selection advantage, helps the tumour to grow rapidly. CpG island hypermethylation is considered one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis, according to which cancer is a result of multiple hits to the DNA. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation varies by tumour type, and often increases with age.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive regions are usually methylated in normal cells. This helps maintain genomic integrity by avoiding deletions, translocations, and insertions, by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, by preventing transpositions, by avoiding transcriptional interference and by preventing illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, methylation levels are lower in the intergenic regions and repetitive regions than in normal cells. This leads to genomic instability, and enhanced tumorigenesis, by enabling the mechanisms listed above that are avoided by heavy methylation in normal cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting refers to allele-specific expression based on parent-of-origin. For example, the paternal allele for a gene may be expressed, and the maternal allele silenced. Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs). Imprinted genes typically exist in clusters, with an ICR for each cluster.</p>
<p>ICR action mechanisms vary with each cluster. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, for example, in normal cells, the ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele. The unmethylated ICR gets bound to the CTCF protein, which insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers. Consequently, Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>In the normal paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. CTCF cannot bind to methylated ICR, and consequently, the downstream enhancers enable Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are often associated with growth, and loss of imprinting can therefore contribute to cancer, either due to hypermethylation or hypomethylation. In Wilm’s tumour, for example, the maternal allele ICR is hypermethylated in the H19/Igf2 cluster, resulting in Igf2 expression in both alleles instead of just the parental allele. This leads to a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth-promoting gene, and this in turn contributes to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that belongs to the DNMTi class of epigenetic inhibitors (inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)). DNMTs are a class of enzymes responsible for laying down DNA methylation de novo, and also for maintaining DNA methylation during DNA replication.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It irreversibly binds DNMTs after incorporation into DNA, which means that the DNMTs can no longer propagate DNA methylation as they would in the absence of Decitabine. Thus, Decitabine can potentially be useful in inhibiting the growth of cancers that tend to rely on DNA hypermethylation and on stable propagation of DNA methylation marks to daughter cells. The mechanisms of Decitabine action are still unclear, and it can be very toxic unless used at low doses. However, Decitabine has been approved by the FDA for treating myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the treatment period, for example by irreversibly binding DNMTs and thus disturbing the stability of mitotic inheritance of DNA methylation markers. Also, these drugs are often non-specific and may impact not just cancer cells but normal cells as well.  The mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood, and their long-term effects are not well known. Consequently, it may not be prudent to treat all patients with such drugs.</p>
<p>A sensitive period with respect to epigenetics may be defined as a period during development when altered environmental conditions can affect epigenetic control. The period from primordial germ cell development to the development of mature eggs and sperm is one sensitive period. The pre-implantation and early post-implantation period is another sensitive period. During both these periods, the epigenome is actively remodeled. Treating patients during these periods with drugs that alter epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation is inadvisable because perturbing the mechanisms could potentially result in serious abnormalities. There may also be other organ-specific sensitive periods during which patients could also be harmed by such drugs.</p></div>
