    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated. These CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoter regions, and their unmethylated state in normal cells allows for the transcription of the genes that follow. In contrast, CpG islands become hypermethylated in cancer cells, silencing the genes that follow. If the genes that follow are tumor repressor genes or genes necessary for epigenetic machinery, their silencing can lead to cancer. In addition, hypermethylation at imprint control regions can lead to a loss of imprinting and possible overexpression of growth promoting genes that cause cells to become cancerous.</p>
<p>In contrast, we expect to see methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells. This methylation provides genomic stabiliy by silencing repetitive elements, preventing antisense transcription, and allowing for DNA replication to occur correctly. In cancer cells, we find hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Without the requisite methylation of these areas genomic instability occurs. Such genomic instability include illegitimate recombination between non-homologous chromosomes, leading to reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions and activation of repeats. In addition, it is possible that the loss of methylation at CpG poor promoters might result in the activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell we see the expression of Igf2 is goverened by different epigenetic marks on the paternal and maternal alleles. On the paternal allele, methylation of an imprint control region means that the CTCF insulator is not able to bind to the region and methylation spreads downstream. Without CTCF and with methylation of the H19 gene just downstream, enhancers further downstream are free to act on the Igf2 locus instead. In this way, imprinting of the paternal allele (methylation) causes expresion of Igf2. In contrast, on the maternal allele a lack of methylation allows CTCF to bind the the imprint control region. Enhancers then promote the expression of H19, at the expense of promotion to Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor we see hypermethylation at this imprint control region. Essentially, both alleles act like the paternal allele, as both are now methylated. This will cause the enhancers to promote the expresssion of Igf2 on both the maternal and paternal allele, giving the patient a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, it can lead to Wilm's tumor, a cancerous tumor of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It acts by irreversibly binding to DNMTs after they come to copy the methylation to the daughter strand during DNA replication. Because they are bound, they can no longer continue methylating the daughter strand, and we should see demethylation in subsequent cell generations. Although the specific mechanism of action that causes an anti-tumor effect is unknown, it is thought that in blood cancers such as Acute Myeloid Lymphoma that some tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, leading to the cancerous behavior. When treated with Decitabine, these tumor suppressor genes will be demethylated and once again activated to suppress growth and tumor-like behavior.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is heritable. Methylation marks laid down on the DNA (or removed from it) are copied to each subsequent generation of cells during DNA replication and the mitosis that follows. Cancer cells tend to be hypermethylated at CpG islands and hypomethylated at intergenic regions and repeats, so if we can alter these methylation problems in the cancer cells, they should pass on these alterations in each round of cancerous cell divisions.</p>
<p>However, we must be careful about treating patients during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods of development occur twice, once during the initial development of the gamete germ cells (early childhood) and then again when those gametes fuse and begin a series of rapid divisions to become a blastocyst (early pregnancy). These two periods are considered sensitive because many epigenetic marks are removed so that the DNA can be reset to stem cell status. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during these sensitive periods because these drugs would have drastic, organism-wide epigenetic effects on the patient's germ cells and/or the developing fetus. In other words, methylation would be altered not only in the quickly-dividing cancerous cell lines, but also in the gametes or fetus.</p></div>
