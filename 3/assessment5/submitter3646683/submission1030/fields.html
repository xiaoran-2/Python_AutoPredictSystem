    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the underlying gene.</p>
<p>CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands appear to become hypermethylated,</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease, for example in the methylation of a tumour suppressing gene this will in turn allow tumour growth.</p>
<p>The genome in general in a normal cell we see introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements methylated which maintains genomic stability. However in cancer we see them hypomethylated this causes genomic instability. With hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements creating genomic instability we see that in illegitimate recombination between repeats such as, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. <em>A</em>vy and <em>Axin</em>fu alleles). We see evidence of this in many human cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer is loss of imprinting. Genes that should be displaying mono-allelic parent of origin specific expression, no longer show this imprinted expression but rather they either become expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. So for example the H19/Igf2 cluster in a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated and unmethylated on the maternal allele. With the maternal ICR unmethylated CTCF binds this insulator element, which means that enhances act on H19, but Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele and therefore will not be expressed. On the paternal allele ICR is methylated the enhancers act on Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to insulate ICR, and therefore Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. With loss of imprinting you have hypermethylation on both parental alleles so you get a double dose of Igf2 expressed as appose to a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm’s tumour ( a childhoold kidney tumour.) This loss of imprinting can be seen in a wide variety of tumour types and occurs as an early event in other words it’s seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMTi (DN methyl transferase inhibitors).</p>
<p>The impact Decitabine has on DNA methylation is that it’s a nucleoside analogue which means it gets incorporated into DNA upon replication.</p>
<p>When the DNMT1 binds to the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DN methyl-transferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. This means that Decitabine is cell division dependant. Hence cancer cells that divide more rapidly will be severely affected because they replicate faster.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect on tumours that are heavily methylated at CPG islands. These epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. This may mean that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p>Periods to avoid treating patients with such drugs would be during sensitive periods (ie: developing germ cells and early development/early embryonic stage), as one large insult to the environment would mean taking a drug that affects the epigenetic machinery hence this needs to be considered what unknown effects (usually undesirable) that would lead to. </p></div>
