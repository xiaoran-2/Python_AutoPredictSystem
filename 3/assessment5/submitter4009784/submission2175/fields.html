    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> Normally Igf2 is imprinted in the father so it is only expressed from paternal copy of the gene. In paternal copy the ICR is normally methylated so insulator protein will not bind to it allowing the enhancer to activate the Igf2 paternal copy</li>
</ul><ul><li>In mother the ICR is un-methylated so insulator is freely able to bind ICR in which this will prevent the activation of Igf2 by enhancer. </li>
</ul><ul><li>The ICR in maternal copy is methylated so the insulator protein will not bind to it so enhancers are active to activate the expression of Igf 2 and H19 will not be expressed and because of the already active paternal copy, this will results in a doubled amount of Igf2 causing an uncontrolled growth.  </li>
</ul><ul><li>Igf2 is normally imprinted from father if there is a problem or mutation in the ICR of the paternal copy which prevent methylation of it, the insulator may bind and block the expression of Igf2. If the ICR in the maternal copy is mutated in which a methylation occurs to it, insulator will not bind so Igf2 will be expressed resulting in doubling the amount of Igf2 so over growth will develop leading to cancer.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabine decreases DNA methylation and augments CTR1 expression through methylation-independent mechanisms.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyle transferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidin, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normally DNA methylation is involved in silencing gene expression but sometimes this methylation will either be more than it should be or less, the thing that can produces a lot of unfavorable effects, for instance in cancer cells there may be a locus specific DNA hyper-methylation in CpGi and CpGi shores of tumor suppressor genes or genome wide DNA hypo-methylation in repetitive regions and ICRs which.</li>
</ul><ul><li>It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. So this is a period in which there is an establishing of the epigenetic marks, i.e when there is a running DNA methylation or histone modification, if a substance or drug is present at that period this will affect the normal patterns of this processes.</li>
</ul><ul><li>During gametogenesis all epigenetic marks are erased so any drugs or substances that will affect the process of re-establishment of these marks will affects this process. Childhood is also a sensitive period.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Because the drug will not allow the re-establishment of the epigenetic marks so it will disrupt the normal patterns of epigenetic marks.</li>
