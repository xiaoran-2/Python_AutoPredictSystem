    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal paternal chromosome the imprint control region (ICR) at the Igf2/H19 cluster on chromosome 11 is methylated and the insulator element CTCF is unable to bind.  Enhancers upstream increase expression of Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2),  a powerful foetal growth factor which promotes growth/division in many tissues.</p>
<p>The normal maternal allele is unmethylated at this ICR and CTCF binds to it, thus preventing  upstream enhancers from acting on the Igf2 locus.  Igf2 is not expressed in the maternal allele and the upstream enhancers increase expression of H19, a growth suppressor.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is a childhood kidney tumour associated with Beckworth-Weiderman Syndrome (BWS) characterised by hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele.  This loss of imprinting leads to a methylation  pattern similar to the paternal allele.  The insulator CTCF no longer binds to the maternal ICR and H19 expression is silenced.  Igf2 is expressed biallelically. </p>
<p>Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is associated with embryonal tumours associated with BWS; rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilm's tumour and hepatoblastoma.  Non-BWS imprinting is found in cancers of the breast, colon, lung and various leucaemias. BWS phenotypes also show foetal and post-natal overgrowth and macroglossia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent and is FDA approved in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes which have progressed to acute myeloid leucaemia.  At higher doses Decitabine has a cytotoxic effect on all rapidly dividing cells. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the DNA promotor sequences of tumour suppressor genes is a common feature of cancers and leads to silencing of these genes.  Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and therefore inhibits tumour progression by demethylating the promotors, allowing the silenced genes to be re-expressed.   </p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds DNMTs after incorporation into DNA, is  replication dependent, and non-specific.  Its mechanism of action is unclear.  Myelodysplastic Syndrome is common in older patients, with poor prognostic outcome, and Decitabine is effective and well tolerated.  </p>
<p>Although Decitabine is primarily used to treat haematological tumours it is currently being trialled in the treatment of many different cancers, including solid tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found, at gene promotors and are normally unmethylated.  Methylation is associated with silencing of gene expression.  Small subsets of CpG islands are methylated between cell types and the inactive X chromosome shows DNA methylation of CpG islands which are bound by proteins MECP1/2 to form a repressive chromatin structure. </p>
<p>Locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, and island shores is associated with silencing of  tumour suppressor genes and this progressively increases during tumourigenesis, acting as a "hit" in the Knudson hypothesis.  Such epimutations increase naturally with age, are rapidly selected for, mitotically heritable and reversible. </p>
<p>Sets of genes showing methylation at CpG islands lead to clinically distinct tumours eg colorectal cancer occurs predominantly in older females with faulty MLH1 (mismatch repair gene) function and satellite instability  Tumours are mainly in the ascending colon and prognosis is good.   Single genes can also be affected in, for example, Lynch Syndrome.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetetive elements are normally methylated globally to maintain genomic integrity.  DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT3a/b and maintained by DNMT1. DNMjT1 null cells display genomic instability resulting in transcriptional interference due to silencing of cryptic transcription or splice sites.</p>
<p>Repetetive elements are silenced by DNA methylation.  Transposition is a cut/copy and paste mechanism within the genome and is mutagenic.  Methylation at long terminal repeats silences expression of Gag and Pol proteins and avoids transcriptional interference from strong promotors downstream.    Mutation of repeats (methylcytosine to thymine) can silence transposition and methylation of repeats prevents illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>Global hypomethylation is a feature of all tumours and increases with age and tumorigenicity. Methylation changes are used in diagnosis (hypermethylation in prostate cancer but not normal prostate tissue), prognosis (miR34b/c hypermethylation is associated with metastasis) and to inform treatment (eg MGMT in glioma).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic reprogramming (associated with DNA demethylation) occurs in two waves; the first is in the germ line and the second is the preimplantation stage of early development.  During these sensitive periods, which are required for mitotic heritability, the epigenome is most at risk of change due to environmental exposures eg diet, chemical exposure or maternal behaviour, trauma.</p>
<p>Genes that are imprinted resist demethylation during early development only. If imprint control regions are hyper or hypo methylated this can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.  </p>
<p>Many studies (eg Overkalix cohort, prepuberty smoking studies etc) have shown that epigenetic changes can have effects on several generations if they coincide with sensitive periods.  A  factor that changes a woman's epigenome during pregnancy may also affect her foetus and its primordial germ cells.  Thus a single exposure can affect three generations as epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable (more if the change is meiotically heritable). </p>
<p>The effects of any treatment that changes the epigenome may have implications for several generations.  Since epigenetics is in its infancy, drug treatments may have unknown effects on the epigenome and are best avoided during sensitive periods unless absolutely essential.</p>
