    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Although DNA methylation almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals, CpG islands normally tend to be protected from methylation. Normal <span>functions of DNA methylation at CpG islands are associated with silencing of gene expression. It is essential for X-inactivation in female mammals. In cancer,however, CpG islands are hypermethylated, i.e. more DNA methylations are found in cancer than in normal state. The hypermethylated CpG islands often contain promotors of tumour suppressor genes. As a result, those tumour suppressor genes is underexpressed or not expressed. This can be considered one of the 'hits' that causes cancer in Knudson hypothesis, which states that cancer is a result of multiply hits to the DNA. </span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand,  at intergenic regoins and repetitive elements,  DNA methylations are common.  Methylation at intergenic region can silence the cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites and can help maintain genomic integrity.  Methylation at repetitive elements can prevent transposition of the repetitive elements,  which might contain strong promotors and interfer transcription of other genes. It also causes mutation (methylated-cytosine to Thymine) in repeats such that they can no longer transpose. Futhermore, it may prevent illegitimate recombination attempt by the repeats. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, i.e. less  DNA methylations are found in cancer than in normal state. This can cause genomic instability and frequent transposition of repeats. The cryptic transcription start site and strong promoters from repeats might enhance expression of oncogen and crytic splice sites might silcence tumour-supressor genes. These contribute to cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase and hence DNA methylation. Since in cancer, some tumor-supressor genes have to be methylated, demethylation can reactivate these genes and thus have an anti-tumour effect. Nowadays, Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes,the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, and is sold as Dacogen.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylations are maintained by DNMT1 through cell division, i.e. DNA methylations are mitotically heritable. Therefore, any cells that come from the original, methylated cell retain the DNA methylation and even if the original cell that was methylated is dead, the methylation is passed on mitotically  and hence altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a state of development of organisms that epigenetic reprogramming is very active and and genomic imprinting is set up. Sensitive periods of development are in early development, i.e. from fertilised egg to blastocyst and epiblast; and in primordial germ cell development. In such period, interference on epigentics can cause serious effect on epigenomics, the differentiation of cells and the development of the individual or his/her gametes. As a result, treating patients with these drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/lgf2 cluster, the imprinted control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is normally methylated. CTCF, which is an insulator protein and can originally bind to the ICR, cannot bind to the ICR now due to the methylation. Without the CTCF, Igf2 is NOT insulated from downstream long range enhancers and lgf2 is actively expressed. Also, the methylation in the ICR spreads to H19 promotor to silence it.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele,  the ICR is normally NOT methylated.  CTCF can bind to the ICR and insulate lgf2 from downstream enhancers.  As a result,  lgf2 expression is NOT active.  Also H19 promoter is not methylated.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, an imprinted disorder causes the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele,  i.e.  both alleles are methylated at the ICR and  NOT methylated at the Kcnq1 cluster.  These cause unregulation of lgf2, which is an oncogene and loss of expression of Cdkn1c tumour supressor.  Since both  expression of oncogene and loss of expression of tumour supressor gene cause cancer,  the disrupting imprinting at H19/lgf2 cluster cause cancer. </p></div>
