    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a FDA approved drug and it belongs to DNMT inhibitors. As nucleoside analog, Decitabine incorporates into DNA blocking DNMT1 irreversibly not allowing maintanance of DNA methylation in the daughter strand after cell division. Cancer cells are dividing much more and faster than the healthy ones and they would be more sucseptible to hypermethylation of DNA in the absence of DNMTi . Although the mechanism is not fully understood, probably Decitabine introduced in lower non-toxic doses demethylates DNA keeping the genomic stability state while inhibiting the inheritance of the epigenetic mark during cancer cells replication.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation at CpG islands is simetrical addition of methyl groups to cytosine as this mark to remain heritable after each cell division. Silencing of genes due to methylation of CpG is carried out through DNA binding and transcriptional repression domains in MeCP1 and 2 proteins. Those proteins could reqruit more factors helping them to inhibit gene activity. Other probable mechanism of silencing is limiting transcriptional factors from binding to DNA. CpG islands are found at the promotors of tumor supressor genes and they assume role similar to genetic mutations as CpG nucleotides are heavily methylated and inhibit tumor supressor genes leading to tumor growth. This epigenetic change is reversible, often occuring in cancer and mitotically heritable contributing to tumorigenesis. Tumor supressor hypermethylation is more prevalent than mutations and is tumor specific as refered to CIMP phenotype, increasing with tumor growth. These distinct profiles of hypermethylation in cancer are potential therapeutic approach targeting different tumors at different stage of the disease using single biomarker or a panel of biomarkers. The role of intergenic intervals in health is to keep the genome integrity silencing cryptic transcription start sites. Repetitive elements also save the genomic stability by silencing repeats so they wont be able to transpose trough the genome. This stage is maintained by mutations for example, avoiding transcriptional interference and limiting inaprpropriate recombination to occur. Unlike CpG islands, in cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.This epigenetic change occurs very early in tumorigenesis and progresses with the disease development and is characteristic feature of all kind of tumors. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions lead to genomic instability by incorrect recombination events, also improper activation of other repeats and transposable elements and silencing or activating adjacent genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the ICR on the paternal allel in H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated providing signal from enhancers to Igf2, which is expressed due to unbinding of insulator to the paternal allel ICR. On the maternal allel CTCF binds to the imprint control region, enhancers act on H19 while Igf2 is silenced. In Whilm's tumor hypermethylation on both maternal and paternal ICRs is observed inducing overexpression of growth promoting Igf2 gene causing in turn disease development. Methylation of ICRs either hyper or hypomethylation is very early event in tumorigenesis. Affecting both stages of methylation could lead to arrest of growth supressing genes and uncontroled cell division. In cancer loss of imprinting is observed and monoallelic profile is no longer maintained - silenced or biparental allel expression is seen. This abnormality is related to the role of the majority of imprinted genes in cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are reversible. This difference from genetic mutations make possible the improvement from the disease and make possible treatment with apropriate drugs to have more sense than treating genetic mutation alterations in cancer. Influencing DNA methylation with specific drugs could be very effective because this epigenetic mark is very frequent in cancer, it increases with tumor growth and is distinctive between tumor types. The balance between hypometylation of repeats or hypermethylation of CpGs must be kept well because either could cause genomic instability and disease development. Small size molecule inhibitors of epigenetic changes are seen to be effective in cancer. Due to their size they can find easily enzyme binding sites even in solid tumors and in lower dose they are able to reduce significantly their toxicity on healthy tissues, reducing side effects. In the case of Dnmt1 there is irreversible binding to DNA inhibiting further replication of malignant cells. Non-specificity somethimes leads to long term consequenses not only for cancer but also for healthy cells which is still a common problem in treating cancer. Sensitive periods are periods of germ cells development, periods of significant epigenetic marks establishment and must be kept in mind all epigenetic mistakes that could accumulate with agening.</p></div>
