    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, in general there are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes, and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions. CpG islands methylation plays an important role in the epigenetic mechanisms that suppress the gene expression. In normal conditions, the CpG are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells, the genes with the hypermethylated CpG islands are aberrantly silenced. Genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, tumor cell invasion, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, cell signaling, transcription and apoptosis are aberrantly hypermethylated in CpG islands and silenced in nearly every tumor. In the other hand, in normal cells the function of DNA methylation in intergenic/repeats intervals is to maintain genomic stability, in other words, avoid instability as illegitimate recombination between repeats, avoid aberration activation of repeats and transposition, and avoid activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. In cancer cells, the intergenic/repeats intervals are hypomethylated, and result in consequent problems where they jump and they can disrupt the coging region of a gene but it algo may activate neighboring genes, this genomic instability appears to enhance tumorigenesis. These alterations of epigenetic patterns such as aberrant DNA hypermethylation/hypomethylation could arise stochastically due to loss of fidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The allelic methylation status of the imprinting control regions (ICR) upstream of the H19 gene is critical to imprinted expression of both H19 and Igf2. The ICR on the maternal chromosome is unmethylated and active, which enables the zinc finger protein CTCF to bind the ICR and blocks access of the enhancers located downstream of H19 to the Igf2 promoter. However, the enhancers can interact with the H19 promoter, and H19 is active. In the paternal chromosome, the ICR at the CTCF binding site is methylated, thus Igf2 promoters can interact with enhancers, thereby triggering the Igf2 genes. Loss of imprinting (LOI) involves activation of the normally silent maternal allele of the Igf2 gene, silencing of the normal active maternal allele of the H19 gene, and aberrant methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of the maternal copy of H19. Then, disruption of imprinting at the Igf2/H19 locus appears to be a key epigenetic aberration in Wilms’ tumor. In tumors with LOI, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, Igf2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes involved in all aspects of tumor development and growth can become aberrantly methylated in tumor cells, including genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, reverses the epigenetic silencing of aberrantly methylated genes. It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription. Therefore, decitabine have antitumor activity, reactivates tumor suppressor genes aberrantly methylated in tumor cells, leading to inhibition of tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period model posits that specific biological systems are highly plastic at specific points in development, that the resulting biological change takes place in response to the environment; and that the biological change is durable, potentially creating stable behavioral tendencies.Experiments in rodents show that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These experience-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes. Consistent with the sensitive period model, it may be that epigenetic process explain the development origins of health and disease hypothesis. This hypothesis was later extended to include cancers and other diseases. According to this, epigenetic changes early in life represent a type of genetic “reprogramming” whereby and experience during a critical period has long-term effects. For example, it has been suggested different molecular mechanism by which this “durable reprogramming” takes place during sensitive periods.Thus, epigenetic mechanism could provide insight into vulnerable windows very early in life that then have long-term implications for health and well-being. Epigenetic mechanism taking place during a sensitive period could then give rise to stressors throughout life and eventuate in diseases states.</p></div>
