    <div class="field-value"><p>Modification of the C5 position in cytosine base is found in 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian somatic cells. DNA methylation in CpG islands is located in promotores and switchess off transcription of required genes. However DNA methylation in cancer cells can occur in promotores of genes which are normally being expressed (hypermethylation). Tumor suppressor genes should be normally expressed to decrease proliferation of defect cells, however in cancer cells they are inactivated by DNA methylation. The same situation can occur in other genes of cell control mechanisms, e.g. DNA repair genes, apoptosis mediators, nuclear receptors, transcription factor and many others. Another target of DNA hypermethylation occurs in CpG island shores. These are defined as 2 kb space regions surrounding CpG islands and represent regions of tissue specific methylation.</p>
<p>On the other hand intragenic loci in cancer cells can be hypomethylated. This means that some loci (e.g. microsatelites, repetitive elements, intergenic regions, introns and inner exons of genes) which should be silenced are activated and being transcribed. Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated and switched off in normal cells. When they are hypomethylated genomic instability occurs. This leads to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of transposition, activation of CpG poor promotores (activation of oncogenes), activation of cryptic promotores and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>All these factors lead to evade growth suppressors, sustain proliferative signaling, resist apoptosis, induce angiogenesis, activate invasion and metastasis and enable replicative immortality of cancer cells.<br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed allele specific, based on parent-of-origin only one allele, maternal or paternal, is expressed. In normal cells H19/Igf2 cluster paternal chromosome is methylated and maternal unmethylated. ICR on maternal allele is bound by CTCF protein as insulator protein. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. These enhancers are free to enhance H19 expression on maternal allele, which serves as a putative tumor suppressor. On paternal allele these enhancers activate Igf2, which is associated with cell growth. If maternal chromosome reverses to paternal epigenotype, methylation in H19 promotore occurs in maternal allele too. It is connected with increased Igf2 and decreased H19 expression. These changes in cell´s epigenome lead to uncontrolled cell growth and are associated with childhood disease Wilms tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has a critical role in epigenetic control in all cells, cancer or normal somatic cells differenced in all tissues. Somatic cells in mammalian body have unique DNA methylation which provide the differentiation and specialization of these cells into tissues. Epigenetic drugs hit every dividing cell, that means they can have a side effect on normal tissue cells, we don´t know the long time cosequences of treatment in this time. Using DNA methyltransferases inhibitors normal cells can be affected and demethylated. In cells there are two sensitive periods of develepment when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, germ cells development and early embryonic development. In these stages there are some loci (e.g. repeats) that are not reprogrammed (demethylated). Using DNMTi these repeats can be demethylated too and cause epigenetic disbalance and instability. Therefore these drugs are undesirable to use in young patients where effects on germ cells needs to be considered.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs seem to be useful in combination with standard chemotheraputic drugs. As epigenetic changes are passed through division to daughter cells, these epigenetic changes last unless they are actively erased. It also seems that these drugs make cancer cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be caused by genetic mutations which are irreversible changes in DNA or epigenetic mutations which are reversible. Drugs tested for epigenetic mutations treatment target enzymatic epigenetic regulators, since enzymes are most readily targeted with these mutations. Decitabine is a cytidine analogue, one of DNA methyltranferases inhibitors. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases after it is incorporated into DNA strands during DNA replication and causes passive DNA demethylation during cell division. Because cancer cells replicate more rapidly than somatic cells, they are more affected by decitabine. High doses of every epigenetic drug can be toxic because of side effects on normal somatic cells because DNA methylation occurs in all tissues. Decitabine is now being used in low doses to treat myelodisplastic syndrome which without proper treatment progresses to acute myeloid leukemia. Recently epigenetic drugs were used to treat solid tumors, not only leukemia or lymphoma.</p></div>
