    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cystosine occurs next to a guanine in linear sequence of bases along its length.There are regions of the genome that have a higher concentration of CpG sites, known as CpG islands.This methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer.CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations.In normal cells,CpG Islands are generally unmethylated.In cancer cells,CpG islands  are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes.This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.Because methylated genes are typically turned off, loss of DNA methylation can cause abnormally high gene activation by altering the arrangement of chromatin.The CpG islands become excessively methylated in cancer cells, thereby causing genes that should not be silenced to turn off. This abnormality is the trademark epigenetic change that occurs in tumors and happens early in the development of cancer.Although epigenetic changes do not alter the sequence of DNA, they can cause mutations.Hypermethylation can also lead to instability of microsatellites, which are repeated sequences of DNA. Microsatellites are common in normal individuals, and they usually consist of repeats of the dinucleotide CA. Microsatellite instability has been linked to many cancers.Aberrant methylation has been reported in almost all cancer types.At a genome-wide level, cancer cells display significant hypomethylation  compared to normal cells. This is attributed to a loss of methylation in intergenic regions containing repetitive elements and is associated with chromosomal instability and activation of endogenous  mobile DNA elements. On the other hand, hypermethylation <br />of gene promoter regions is also seen in almost all cancer types with many reports of tumour suppressor genes being silenced.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 &amp; H19 genes are reciprocally imprinted and closely linked.Igf2 is predominantly expressed from paternal allele, while H19 is expressed from maternal allele. Increased activity of the <em>IGF2</em> gene has been associated with many types of cancer.Normally,<em>IGF2</em> gene undergoes genomic imprinting.In some cancers both paternal and maternal copies of gene are active, increasing the amount of Igf2 that cells can produce.This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting.An increased amount of Igf2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.Imprinted <em>Igf2</em> gene is active only on the paternal allele in most tissues. Its imprinting involves a <em>cis</em>-acting imprinting-control region located upstream of the neighboring and maternally expressed <em>H19</em>gene.In Wilms tumors the maternal IGF2 imprint is relaxed such that the gene is expressed biallelically.It was found that biallelic expression of IGF2 was associated with undetectable or very low levels of H19 expression.Relaxation of IGF2 imprinting in Wilms tumors also involved a concomitant reversal in the patterns of DNA methylation of the maternally inherited IGF2/H19 alleles.This suggest that there has been an acquisition of a paternal epigenotype in these tumors as the result of a pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes.<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-243aa88bd503998b5bc47c44/970238/asst-5/970238-520f792f4ed759.82397537.jpg" alt="" /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

<p><span>A group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases catalyze methylation of cytosine residues in newly synthesized DNA, thus replicating methylation signal.The</span> mechanism of inhibiting DNMT results in hypomethylation of DNA and re-expression of tumor suppressor genes.<span>Decitabine inhibits cell proliferation through nonreversible covalent linking with DNA methyltransferase and blocking of DNA synthesis. At lower doses, decitabine induces hypomethylation, thereby promoting cell differentiation, re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, stimulation of immune mechanisms, and suppression of tumor growth.<span>Decitabine reverses the classic epigenetic alteration, DNA promoter methylation.It acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription.In adrenocortical carcinoma, research has shown six significantly underexpressed genes on 11q13, and the reversal of that silencing could have antitumor effects.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify genome in a way that tells it what/where/when to do it.Epigenome is made up of chemical compounds, comes from man-made sources like medicines or pesticides.As it marks genome with these chemical tags,it serves as intersection between the genome &amp; environment.We are all familiar with notion that genes are not destiny and that development of an individual’s mind and body occur in a manner that is sensitive to them.In case of the brain,one of ways in which environment gets factored into development called sensitive periods where certain parts of brain transiently rely on sensory experience in order to develop.Studies have shown that experiences during sensitive periods of development can program genes through DNA methylation.Epigenetic alterations have been identified for several genes known to play prominent roles in cognition and psychiatric disorders.Genetic studies have attempted to elucidate causal mechanisms for the development of complex disease, but genome-wide associations have been largely unsuccessful in establishing these links. As an alternative link between genes and disease,recent efforts have focused on mechanisms that alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence.Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns have been associated with disease.</p>
