    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands promotes silencing of gene expression. In cancer, there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation, where CpG islands have shores of tumour supressor genes. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands causes genome instability and mutations. At intergenic regions, Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability and methylation helps silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. At repetitive elements, there is a silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylation of repeats which may prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unable to maintain genomic integrity. This in turn, contributes to disease as there are epigenetic alterations as biomakers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the methylation pattern of Igf2, CTCF, which is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog and belongs to the class of nucleoside 2-deoxycytidine. It is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. DNA hypomethylation is achieved at concentrations below those required to significantly inhibit DNA synthesis, which may promote restoration of function to genes associated with control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. Cytotoxicity in rapidly dividing cells may also result from covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. In summary, Decitabine interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body by disrupting DNA synthesis. This disruptive activity promotes cytotoxic DNA hypomethylation and apoptotic cell death in rapidly dividing cells, thereby having an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An epigenome consists of a record of the chemical changes to the DNA and histone proteins of an organism; these changes can be passed down to an organism's offspring. Altering DNA methylation can result in changes to the structure of chromatin and changes to the function of the genome, thereby having enduring effects on the genome. A sensitive period consists of a special sensitivity that arouses a strong spontaneous desire to learn and master some skill or concept. It is basically a time especially devoted to the acquisition of a particular trait, where the period is of transitory and varying duration. Once that trait is acquired, the sensitivity disappears. The sensitive periods of development include the stages of gamete formation, egg fertilization, blastocyst formation, epiblast formation, primodal germ cell formation. Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. These are the periods when the development of the embryo occurs and makes the embryo most susceptible to altering cells in some lasting way which would harm the embryo in later stages. </p></div>
