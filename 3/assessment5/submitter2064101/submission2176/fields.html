    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands (specifically at the promoter region of genes) results in suppression of genes.  In a normal cell, CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes are hypomethylated.  Thus, normal cells exhibit active tumor suppressor genes.  In contrast, cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes.  Therefore, these genes are repressed.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes, in addition to other "hits" to DNA, results in uncontrolled proliferation of cells, thus leading to development of cancer.  Furthermore, as the cancer progresses, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands also progresses.  And since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, daughter cells of cancerous cells will continue to divide in an uncontrolled manner.  </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in contrast to CpG islands, are normally hypermethylated.  Hypermethylation of both of these regions contributes to chromosome stability by keeping them more inaccessible and densely packed in a heterochromatic state.  In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated.  Therefore, they are not densely packed and are in a euchromatic state.  As a result, repetitive elements may illegitimately recombine at different parts of the genome.  Hypomethylation of repetitive elements may also lead to activation of these repeats, meaning that they may make extra copies of themselves and then transpose into other parts of the genome.  Transposition may lead to disruption of coding regions of the genome through random insertion of the transposed repeats.  Additionally, transposition may lead to activation of neighboring genes.  This works by the transposed repetitive element acting as a cryptic promoter.  Thus, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements may disrupt genomic stability in several manners, leading to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the major characteristics of many cancer cells is the loss of imprinting.  Many imprinted genes have important functions in growth and development.  Therefore, depending on the methylation pattern at imprint control regions (ICR), the result could be loss of expression of growth suppressing genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes (the imprint control region could be either hypo OR hypermethylated, depending on the function of the genes around the imprint control region).  Take, for example the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>The paternal allele is normally hypermethylated at the ICR.  As a result, the enhancers that are downstream H19 will activate Igf2, because CTCF is not insulating the ICR.  H19, on the other hand is silenced.</p>
<p>In contrast to the paternal allele, the maternal allele is normally hypomethylated at the ICR.  Therefore, CTCF will insulate the ICR, causing the enhancers that are downstream of H19 to activate H19.  Thus, Igf2 is silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is lost because both paternal and maternal allele are hypermethylated at the ICR.  As a result, there is an overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth-promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  As a DNMTi, it is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated in the DNA during DNA replication.  Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) is the enzyme that transfers the methylation pattern from mother strand to daughter strand, DNMT will bind to the DNMTi nucleotide during DNA replication.  When it does so, the DNMT will be bound irreversibly and will no longer be able to be released.  Therefore, the function of DNMT as a methylating agent will be lost.  </p>
<p>Since many cancers exhibit CpG island hypermethylation (of tumor suppressor genes), loss of DNMT functionality may halt the proliferation of cancer cells by preventing daughter cells from inheriting the hypermethylation patterns in the cancerous mother cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation, such as by using DNMTi's, can have a lasting effect on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  Therefore, preventing the transfer of methylation patterns from one cell to its daughter cell can have a lasting effect on the methylation pattern in subsequent generations of cells as well (even after the drug treatment is finished).  But since drugs that alter DNA methylation will effect the DNA methylation patterns in all cells (both cancerous and normal cells), one must be wary of when these drugs are administered.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are defined as periods of development where methylation patterns are "erased" from the genome, only to be reestablished later on in development.  This process is called epigenetic reprogramming.  There are two sensitive periods of development- pre-implantation and primordial germ cell development.  Treating patients (especially younger patients) during this period with drugs that alter DNA methylation may cause abnormal "reestablishment" of the epigenome.  The drugs may cause further aberrations of the epigenome of the developing germ cells, potentially having detrimental effects on the sperm or egg.  Additionally, if the drugs were administered after fertilization, they may cause epigenome alterations that may negatively impact development of the embryo.</p></div>
