    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are groups of cytosine and guanine dinucleotides that tend to occur at gene promoters, the regions upstream of their respective genes where transcription factors bind in order to bring about gene expression. Methylation is the addition, by de novo methyltransferase, of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of a cystosine nucleotide, thereby silencing gene expression. Steadily increasing hypermethylation of CpG islands that are normally unmethylated is a hallmark of cancer. Where CpG islands occur at promoters of tumour suppressor genes, methylation inactivates the gene. As the cell is then more likely to survive and rapidly divide it gains a competitive advantage over other cells and is able to proliferate, an important aspect in the development of diseases such as cancer which involve uncontrolled cell growth. As the name suggests, intergenic regions are areas of DNA lying between genes. They can be associated with introns, the non-coding regions removed by post transcription gene splicing. They may have their own cryptic promoter sites that operate in the opposite direction to normal promoters and so if they bind their own transcription factors they can interfere with normal gene transcription. They are therefore usually silenced through methylation to prevent this happening. Repetitive elements are regions of DNA with the capacity to copy or move and insert themselves into other regions of the genome, potentially disrupting gene expression unless silenced by methylation. Increasing hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is another hallmark of cancer. This is because non-silencing of intergenic regions can lead to genetic instability such as deletions, duplications, insertions and translocations. Similarly non-silencing of repetitive elements can lead to inappropriate gene expression, such as silencing of tumour suppressors or activation of growth promoters (oncogenes). Both of these developments may lead to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is located at an imprint control region (ICR) on chromosome 11. H19 codes for a long non-coding RNA and includes a CpG island promoter. Igf2 is a growth promoter gene and therefore potential oncogene. The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The unmethylated maternal ICR is normally bound by the insulator protein CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, allowing them to act on – and enhance expression of – H19, by chromatin looping. As the paternal ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and so, without this insulator function, downstream enhancers can act on Igf2 and activate its growth-promoting properties. Therefore Igf2 is imprinted on the paternal allele. Without CTCF binding, methylation at the ICR spreads downstream to include H19, rendering it inactive. This paternal imprinting is disrupted when the maternal ICR is hypermethylated as CTCF cannot bind and methylation spreads downstream to inactivate H19 and allow downstream enhancers to activate the oncogene Igf2. In effect, both maternal and paternal allele are imprinted leading to a double dose of Igf2 expression, resulting in the childhood kidney cancer Wilm’s Tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is described in the article as a DNA demethylating agent. Specifically, it is a de novo methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and hence targets DNMTs, the enzymes that methylate hemimethylated DNA during cell division. While the mechanism of action is unclear, it is thought that Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analogue and binds to DNA during replication where it causes DNMT to be bound irreversibly, preventing it from methylating the daughter strand. It has been successfully used to treat the blood cancer myelodysplastic syndrome. Hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancers such as this. As rapidly dividing cells are seen most in tumour cells when DNMT will be most in evidence, by preventing methylation at this time the drug will tend to target tumours more than healthy cells and so halt the progression of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>During cell division, epigenetic marks are copied over to the daughter cells so they maintain the same gene expression profiles and phenotype as the parent cell. This occurs at all subsequent cell divisions throughout an individual’s life. Called mitotic heritability, it ensures cellular identity and safeguards tissue homogeneity by ensuring the same sets of genes are expressed in all daughter cells. Any alterations to DNA methylation, e.g., through anti-cancer drugs, will therefore also be inherited and have enduring effects on the epigenome. At particular periods of active epigenomic remodelling and reprogramming, called sensitive periods, existing epigenetic marks are removed and new marks laid down. These periods include production of mature eggs and sperms, pre-implantation and early post implantation, and primordial germ cell. At these times new marks are introduced that are specific to, for example, the unique functions of eggs and sperms. Epigenetic marks that are unique to the egg and sperm are then removed and new marks laid down to ensure totipotency in the stem cells. Treating patients during sensitive periods may therefore alter epigenetic reprogramming, resulting in, for example, non-viable egg and sperm cells or stem cells.</span></p></div>
