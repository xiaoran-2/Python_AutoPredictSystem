    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>We have two type aberrations of DNA methylation that used for diagnosed and prognosis: Locus specific DNA hypermethylation and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. In the normal cells three areas are methyleted: intergenic gene, gene and repetitive gene.  By add methyl group to cytosine of these areas inhibited the binding of transcription factors and inhibited gene expression or translation, finally. For example: inhibited of expression of ontogeny. Also in normal cell, CpG-Island is unmythelated. But cancer cells are different pattern of methylation from normal cells. CpG-island of cancer cell are methylated in compared with normal cell, but another are such as intergenic gene, gene and repetitive gene are unmythelated. So CpG-island methylation is more dances from normal cells. On the other hand 5mc methylation is dance from cancer cells. So tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations.</p>
<p>CpG-island hypermethylation is the good biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer. For example; GSTP1 hypermethylation in prostate cancers not benign growths is good diagnostically biomarkers, miR-34b/c hypermethylation that are associated with metastasis in breast cancer is good prognoivelly biomarkers and MGMT hypermethylation (in glioma) is good biomarkers for don’t used from temozolomide as a chemotherapeutic drugs. Also we must notificed that Identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumour type – found by genome-wide DNA methylation studies. So must consider all epigenetics modification that act in cancer; because recognized DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis (cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">we know that it's unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele,it's paternally imprinted, seeing as the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome.. this in imprint control region is unmethylated as a maternal allele. It is bound by a protein called CTCF. when CTCF blocks this by it's binding, now the secondary preference is occuring. And the enhancers loop to H19, to ehance H19 expression. On the patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind. And if CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2.</p>
<p dir="ltr">. And it can result from a large number of different abnormalities that are found in this particluar region of chromosome 11. Chromosome 11 q15.5 and normally its by, some abrogation to this whole region which is about one megabase in size. So these disruptions lead to problems with both Kcnq1 cluster expression and the Igf2/H19 cluster expression. But perhaps the most common in the ones that I'll explain, are disruptions to Cdkn1c expression and disruption to Igf2 expression. So Cdkn1c as a tumor suppressor, it restricts growth. However, what Igf2 does is it promotes growth, it's an oncogene</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We have 5 types drug; act as inhibitors epigenetics machine DNMTi-HDACi-HMTi-HATi-HDMi. Decitabine and Vidaza are DMTi. They're approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia or AML.HDAi is are approved for a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.This DNA methyltransferase inhibitors drugs, that was 5-azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase one. These drugs, Vidaza and decitabine and also any of the other that are in pre-clinical trial are kind of very similar to 5-Azacytidine. They've just had additional modifications take place, so they're all nucleoside analogs. So they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Cancers, and so solid cancers and these combinations of drugs and solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. So probably in the coming years, they'll be approved for all sorts of other cancers as well. What's quite interesting is cancer isn't the only case where we have epigenetic abnormalities, it's not the only disease, it is the one that affects most people by far. But maybe these drugs that are being developed because of the high prevalence of cancer in a community may actually be useful for other disorders as well, these disorders where we know epigenetic makeup is altered. And so, indeed, now they are being considered, these epigenetic drugs are being considered with other cases as well. And perhaps the awareness that we should keep those, the wariness that should remember about is that still these drugs are going to be used throughout the system until every cell could has a potential to be effected by these drugs. So maybe still need to keep in mind that Younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells for example in sensitive periods. We should remember about the sensitive period so that one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
