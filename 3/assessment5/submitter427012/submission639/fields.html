    <div class="field-value">In normal somatic cells there is a predictable pattern of DNA methylation that ensures genome stability and the right balance of gene expression.  
Repetitive elements that can destabilize the genome through overexpression and random insertion are constitutionally methylated and silenced.  
Intergenic CpG nucleotides are also generally methylated and act to attenuate expression and prevent mis-expression while CpG Islands
are often left unmethylated to ensure activation of their promoter regions.  In cancer there is disruption of these patterns resulting in hypomethylation of repetitive elements,
 hypomethylation of intergenic regions and hypermethylation of CpG Islands.  In many ways this is the worst possible combination as the cell is left with silencing of 
 tumor suppressor genes by the CpG Island methylation, a destabilized genome due to random repetitive element insertions in each generation and overexpression of many 
 genes due to the lack of methylation in the intergenic regions.  The onset of a malignancy signifies the achievement of a 'perfect' balance between these factors that
 is very difficult to contend with.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Genomic imprinting is critical to the function of diploid cells such as our own.  With 2 copies of every gene, there are many instances where expression
of both copies can be detrimental to the point of lethality for the organism and this is why one copy is 'imprinted' through epigenetic silencing during maturation
of the germ cells.  The H19/Igf2 cluster is a growth promoting region that is maternally imprinted to prevent the severe consequences of overexpression.  Igf2 requires
access to enhancers that are downstream and in the maternal allele this is blocked by the binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the Imprint Control Region of the cluster.  This
not only silences Ifg2 but activates H19 which then occupies the enhancers.  In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated along with the promoter region of H19, thereby preventing CTCF from binding at this location and allowing Ifg2 access to the enhancers.  In this way only one copy of the Igf2 gene is expressed and growth proceeds as normal.  In the case of Wilm's Tumor, CTCF is unable to bind in the proper location to block the enhancers, resulting in maternal expression equivalent to that of the paternal allele and overexpression of Igf2.  This situation most often arises as a result of mutation somewhere in the cluster such as a deletion
of the ICR but it can also be caused by an epigenetic error in imprinting.  In the case of cancer, a loss of ICR methylation on the maternal allele results in overepression of the
growth promoting Igf2 which contributes to malignancy.  Such disregulation of imprinted genes is common in cancer as many such genes are associated with cell growth and 
proliferation.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that acts to passively remove methyl groups from DNA by inhibiting DMT enzymes.  
A common characteristic of cancer is the hypermethylation of CpG Islands which results in 
the silencing of normally active tumor suppressing genes.  When these genes are epigenetically silenced in this manner it removes a critical control on cell
proliferation and greatly contributes to malignancy.  By inhibiting DMT enzymes the malignant cells lose this hypermethylation with each successive generation as these 
enzymes are required to methylate the daughter strands during mitosis.  In this way Decitabine re-activates tumor suppressor 
genes and allows the cell the opportunity to regulate itself again and perhaps enter apoptosis.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">At the forefront of cancer research is the quest to modify the cancer epigenome which is highly disregulated in all malignancies.  It is hoped that such modifications can 
stop cell proliferation and ultimately allow them to die through built in mechanisms.  Dr Stephen Baylin gave lung cancer
patients a combination of Dacetylase and DMT inhibitors to test the effects on a solid tumor.  A significant number of patients experienced direct benefit from the drug in slowed tumor progression but it was the patients that failed to show direct benefit that are of interest here.  Those patients continued through standard treatment and showed a marked improvement in their response.  This suggests that although the epigenetic agents failed to slow tumor growth on their own, they nonetheless made an impact on the tumor epigenome that was persistent and made the tumor more receptive to subsequent standard therapy.  Perhaps the re-activation of tumor suppressors and regulators of apoptosis were better able to respond to the damage inflicted by the standard therapy.  This also highlights the perils of using such therapy during sensitive periods in egigenetic programming such as in the blastocyst and during migration / maturation of the germ cells.  It is during these times that epigenetic marks are largely removed and then reapplied in a gender / cell specific manner.
Applying such therapy during these critical periods could easily result in catastrophic consequences for the epigenome, killing an existing embryo or
rendering the patient infertile.  </div>
