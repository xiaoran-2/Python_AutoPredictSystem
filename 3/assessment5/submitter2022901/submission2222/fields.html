    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are spread throughout the genome and normally are unmethylated at promoters, which enables transcription of genes (methylation at this sites always means gene silencing), and methylated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which ensures genomic stability. This pattern is reversed in cancer cells, which is common to all known types of cancer.</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> Locus-specific DNA hypermethylation at promoters of tumour supressor genes disrupts their expression that leads to overgrowth. Absence of methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elemens</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> causes genomic instability, that in turn leads to accumulation of other mutations and disruption of other functional genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of imprinted genes are associated with growth, therefore, imprinting disruption is strongly linked to oncological processes.  Such disruption is well understood<span> at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumour. Normally, maternal allele at this cluster has unmethylated ICR that enables it to bind CTCF insulator, which prevents inchancers from activating Igf2, which in turn leads to expression of H19. Paternal allele has methylated ICR and does not bind the insulator, so inchancers are free to act on Igf2 locus and Igf2 is expressed in paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour maternal allele becomes methylated and acts like paternal one, resulting in double dose of Igf2 compared to normal cells. As Igf2 is growht promoting it lead to overgrowth in kidney tissue.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to class of demethylating agents that can remove methylation marks. As hypermethylation is common to all known cancers, this drug can stop cancers from growing by removing methyl groups and thus changing their epigenetic state. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although methylation marks are mitotically inherited, they are  actively removed and afterwards aqcuired during so-called sensitive periods. There are two of such critical stages in epigenetic development - one during early development right after fertilization, and one during development of primordial germ line cells. Aquisition of new epigenetic marks is essential for normal development, and, therefore, demethylating agents taken during sensitive periods can potentially disrupt epigenetic patterns required for  proper functioning.</p></div>
