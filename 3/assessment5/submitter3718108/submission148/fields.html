    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG Islands is usually related to gene silencing. Usually the CpG island is not methylated in normal cells, allowing transcription and gene activity. In tumor cells the CpG islands are usually hypermethylated, preventing the activity of tumor suppressor genes which have CpG islands in their promoters. The methylation in repetitive and intergenic regions serves to maintain silenced transposable elements and preventing aberrant recombination, and so promoting the chromosomal stability. In cancer, not only the hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs but also the hypomethylation of the genome as a whole. The hypomethylation of the genome affects many repetitive sequences and transposable elements and it is believed that it causes chromosomal instability and results in increased mutations events. We know that the repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation which means that repeats have the capacity to actually make copies of themselves, jump around the genome or transpose. This can result in consequent problems where they jump into because of course they may not olnly disrupt the coding region of a gene but it also may activate neighboring genes.</p>
<p>Well, this chromossomal instability may lead to occurrence of cancer as it is known, for example, that mice with decreased levels of DNMT1 in some tissues developed cancer, so some types of cancers are driven by chromosomal instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf 2 is methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind to its insulator element, the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent in this maternal allele (no expression). On the paternal allele, as it is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding, so Igf2 is expressed from the patternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is high hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well, so you also have expression of Igf2 in this allele, having double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs that targets the enzymatic epigenetic regulators, more specifically a hypomethylating agent of the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released.</p>
<p>So Decitabine hypomethylates DNA passively, by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This process of demethylation allows restoring the normal function of tumor suppressor genes, due to hypomethylation of their CpG islands, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic drugs have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because they modify the epigenetic state of the cell and unlike other forms of gene regulation (like those involving transcription factors), epigenetic changes are passed to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>We should avoid using these drugs during “sensitive periods”, which means periods of development that are susceptible to environmental signals. Two important sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming are during germ cell development, and early development. As these drugs are going to be used throughout the system and every cell can be effected we have to keep in mind that younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells (which are in sensitive periods) should not take these drugs as it could be a large insult to the environment to be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. So these sorts of things still need to be considered.</p></div>
