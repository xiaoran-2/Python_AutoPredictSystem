    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually associated with repressive chormotin structure formation and may prevent binding of transcription factors thus cause the transcription suppression of the downstream genes. In normal cells, CpG islands are not metholyated, however, in cancer cell they are tend to be hypermethylated. CpG islands hypermethylation is cohorted with the progress of the disease, and different sets of CpG islands are hypermethylated in different cancers. CpG hypermethylation will silencing the downstreaming gene expression, including some encode tumer supressors, which will promote cancer development.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can maitain genomic intergraty and prevent criptic transcrption from these regions. In normal cell, these regions are hypermethylated, but in cancer, they are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause genomic instability, and promote oncogene expression.</p>
<p>And both of them will also disrupt the normal gene imprinting patterns, causing overexpressing or underexpressing certain important genes, which might contribute to the cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele, the ICR of H19/Igf2 is methylated, which blocks the binding of CTCF, an insulator that blocks the downstream enhancer effects on Igf2. Without CTCF, downstream enhancer promotes the transcription of upstream Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, CTCF can binds to the ICR. And insulates the enhancer, which cause silencing of the Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, ICRs on both the maternal and paternal allele are hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICRs on both allele, cause the overexpression of Igf2, a growth promote gene, which promotes the tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>It's a nucleoside analogue, once it's incorporated into DNA, it will inreversibly bind DNMTs, which will inhibit the DNMTs activity and lower the overall gonome methylation level.</p>
<p>The possible anti-tumor effect of Decitabine could be prevent the hypermutation of the CpG island, which silences tumor supressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, the pattern of which, once establsihed, can be passed on to its progenitors. So it will have a enduring effects.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is a time frame when the whole genome undergos epigenetic reprogramming and a highly sensitive to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. The pre-implantation period during eraly development and the period during primodial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with these drugs duirng these sensitive periods, will alter the normal epigenetic reprogramming process and causing inadversible effects on patient itself or their proginies through their altered germ cells.</p></div>
