    <div class="field-value"><p>1) DNA methylation is a biochemical process in which there is addition of methyl groups in cytosine or adenine nucleotides in DNA. In normal cells, CpG islands preceding gene promoters remain unmethylated while other CpG islands(intergenic regions and repetitive elements) downstream from promoter are methylated. But in cancer cells CpG island have two patterns-hypermethylation and hypomethylation.</p>
<p>2) HYPERMETHYLATION of CpG islands preceding the tumor supressor gene promoter will stop the trancription(gene silencing) of tumor supressor gene for its normal function in response to DNA damage. Examples- cell cycle inhibitor p53, cyclin dependent kinase gene p16, DNA repair gene etc.</p>
<p>3) HYPOMETHYLATION of CpG islands of oncogene promoter region. Hypomethylation of other parts in genome will result in loss of imprinting(loss of imprinting of insulin like growth factor) and tranposable elements reactivation(Ex- colorectal cancer ).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the monoallelic expression of genes in a parent-of-origin specific manner. One of the example of genomic imprinting is imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. Its unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele. H19 is a reservoir of long non-coding RNA. On unmethylated maternal allele it is bound by CTCF which is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2. On Insulated Igf2, enhancers(on downstream region) can bind to H19 to enhance its expression.</p>
<p>In the case of paternal allele H19/Igf2 is methylated. CTCF cannot bind to H19 and now enhancers bind to uninsulated Igf2 and enhance Igf2 expression and this is how Igf2 is expresses on paternal allele.</p>
<p><strong>WILM'S TUMOUR</strong>-Overexpression of Igf2 gene, an imprinted gene(paternal allele) located on chromosome 11 in humans results in several abnormalities like Wilm's Tumour(cancer of kidney develops in embryo) due to loss of heterozygosity . The expression of both genes is regulated by DMR(differentially methylated region). The methylation spreading(gene silencing) on maternal allele downstream blocks H19 expression and on the other side overexpression of Igf2 on paternal allele(2 biallelic expression) results in embryonal kidney abnormalities.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dicitabine is, a cytidine analog, a class of drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome(dysfunctional blood cells) and for acute myeloid leukemia(AML). It is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese Company. It is a hypomethylating agent, it inhibits DNA methyltranferase. But it can oly be incorporated on DNA strand.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism of Dicitabine</strong>- Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects following its conversion to decitabine triphosphate, where the drug directly incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme that is responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA in mammalian cells. This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. In cae of CpG islands, they are methylation independent for their activity but in cancer development or some other abnormalities they become hypermethylated which causes silencing of genes associated with that particular CpG islands. However, in other parts of genome this methylation helps in silencing repititive elements and antisense silencing.</p></div>
