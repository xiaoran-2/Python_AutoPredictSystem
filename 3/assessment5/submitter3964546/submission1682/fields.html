    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Certainly, regular DNA methylation is altered in cancer. Normally, most of the CpG islands are methylated, which causes a turnoff of the gene. First of all there's DNA hypermethylation that is locus-specific. And secondly, there's genome-wide hypomethylation. You find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed, even in the introns of genes And, the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements, and these intergenic elements and indeed the introns are hypomethylated. So, there is a swap in cancr cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. And in general when you look at where the CpG islands are found, they're in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So, this has an effect: tumor suppressor genes may be turned-off and be one hit for the development of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IGF2 H19 cluster is the imprint control region. And it's methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds the insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. The paternal allele can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, you lose imprinting: what happenes is you have high methylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the azacytidines, inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases. It is an epigenetic drug that is used in order to be able to demethylate methylated CpG islands, that especially occur in cancer and that might turnoff tumor suppressor genes. By demethylating those genes, a featured hit can be prevented and the developmental risk of getting cancer is reduced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Early life in general constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, which is considered to be during the so called sensitive period. A sensitive period is also a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture. </p>
<p>DNA methylation changes can have enduring effects on the epigenome, as they are mitotically heritable and probable detrimental altered DNA methylation can induce problems (e.g. turning off supressor genes) for the children for instance.</p>
<p>Obviously, treating a patient during sensitive periods would be inadvisabel, due to the fact that the development is influenced by several different factors and that it can not be forseen in how far a DNA methylation can affect the development in the context of a sensitive period.</p></div>
