    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena, including imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin.  It is normal for DNA methylation in CPG islands of promoter regions to be kept free of methylation regardless of their activity state.  It has been found that in cancer CPG islands tend to be hypermethylated – which causes inappropriate silencing of the Gene in question.  DNA is often methylated in intergenic regions, which often contain repetitive elements and the remnants of retroviral insertions, the methylation in these regions thus suppresses any alternative start sites that may be present. If this methylation is disrupted this then may cause aberrant transcription of RNA and consequently disruption to normal cell process such as apoptosis.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is normal for one of the two parental alleles of an autosomal gene to be silenced epigenetically. This is in order to achieve the correct levels of the product produced by a gene. IGF2 is imprinted such that only the allele inherited from ones father is active. The insulator between the IGF2 promoter and enhancer is methylated in the paternal allele leading to its expression, in contrast to maternal allele which lacks this methylation of the insulator region and is therefore not expressed. Disrupting of this cluster can lead to obesity <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/29">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/29</a> IGF2 is also often over expressed in many tumors including Wilms because of a disruption to the correct imprinting pattern. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that is a hypomethylating agent that acts on DNA only. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase which would normally catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to DNA. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. In a myelodysplastic syndrome hematopoiesis is disorderly and non effective, the regions of DNA that normally code for the correct elements are over methylated leading to an over expression of the product. Decitabine therefore helps correct this by returning the methylation to the normal amount.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cells undergoing mitosis often pass their Epigenetic marks to their daughter cells.  This explains how drugs that effect epigenetic marks will a have longer term effect than just at the time of drug use.  As the cell line will have had changes that are being passed on to future cells.</p>
<p>The normal epigenetic marks are reprogrammed at certain developmental periods. These include periods when the gametes are formed and early in the foetal development , these periods are known as sensitive periods as any changes here will have a large aberrant effect on future cells.  This is why out of caution Drugs that effect epigenetic imprinting would be ill advised to be consumed during a sensitive period of reprogramming. </p></div>
