    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification, it is the addition of a methyl group at the 5th position of cytosine. It can occur in CpG islands, intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements.</p>
<p>In mammalian genome CpG islands have been found in 40% of promoters. Usually it tends to be unmethilated, methilation of this region associated with gene silencing.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands of promoters of tumor suppressor genes acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing.</p>
<p>DNA methylation also can occur in intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements; usually they are methylated. Methyletion of these regions is necessary for maintenance of genome stability.</p>
<p>In cancer cells this regions are unmethylated, which leads to genomic instability and chromosomal abberations such as delitions, insertions, duplications.</p>
<p> So alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are genes which expression is determined by the parent that contributed them. Imprinting occures by methilatyng DNA in promoters, this results in block of gene transcription. </p>
<p>IGF2 encodes a potent mitogenic growth factor that is active in early development and plays an important role in embryonic and fetal growth. IGF2 binds to the IGF-I receptor to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that lead to cell proliferation. Increased expression of IGF2 is a common feature of malignancies.</p>
<p>IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele, whereas the maternal allele is normally inactive (imprinted). IGF2 imprinting is removed in many different types of tumors, including Wilms' tumor.</p>
<p>This loss of imprinting (LOI) occurs when there is abnormal activation of the maternal copy of IGF2 and the resultant overexpression contributes to tumor growth. In Wilms' tumor, maternal hypermethylation and biallelic IGF2 expression are common.</p>
<p>The level of H19 RNAs in Wilms' tumor is also found to inversely correlate with levels of IGF2 mRNA.</p>
<p>All these leads to abnormal proliferation of kidney tissue and nephroblastoma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells whole level of methylation is lower than in normal cells, but the promotors of oncogene suppressors are hypermethilated. That is the way how cancer cell blocks the expression of suppressors and survive. Enzyme DNA methyltransferase add methyl group to the CpG island of promoter and switch off gene activity.</p>
<p>Several epigenetic drugs are described in the article "Cancer’s epicenter”.</p>
<p>For example decitabine. It belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. This class includes nucleoside analogues. Mechanism of action based on covalent bonding of ferment and decitabine, so DNA methiltransferase cannot do their function, and undergo degradation. That is the way to remove methyl groups and recover the oncogene suppressor’s activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation – modification of DNA molecule without any change in its sequence. Methylation occurs by adding methyl group to cytosine. This epigenetic modification preserve through cell mitosis and can be passed through generations with the help of mitosis. DNA methylation usually leads to gene silencing.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of life when epigenetic reprogramming happened - germ cells development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Through the germ cell development we have epigenetic reprogramming of its genome. Also maternal and paternal genome are cleaned and resettled through the early embryonic development.</p>
<p>And that is why treating during the sensitive period would be inadvisable. All epigenetic changes done by drugs will be resettled and cancer cells would rise again.</p></div>
