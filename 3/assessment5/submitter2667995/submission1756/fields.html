    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions rich in Cytosine and Guanine, regions that are promoting transcription of DNA sequences usually downstream. These promoter regions are methylated or unmethylated. Methylation at the CpG island silences the gene.<strong>Normal cells are more likely to have unmethylated CpG islands</strong>.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands can be hypermethylated. This modified epigenetic mark is heritable through cell division (mitosis) and can be considered an epimutation, an alternative to genetic mutations that can cause tumorigenesis.  <strong>Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes’ promoters</strong> is a frequent mechanism that causes abnormal cell growth; another feature of hypermethylation is its unique, specific profile depending on the tumour subtype. The abnormal methylation of the CpG islands is also age related and can be one of the ‘hits’ in the cell’s DNA (Knudson hypothesis on the Rb), that enables the competitive advantage of the tumour to spread in the normal tissue and take its place.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation can affect a single gene (GSTP1 diagnostic in prostate cancer; BRCA1 in breast cancer and MLH1 and MGMT in colorectal cancer) or a panel of genes (CIMP).</p>
<p>Intergenic regions, repetitive elements, introns, and CpG poor promoters are methylated in normal cells, where most of them have to remain silenced. <strong>Hypomethylated in cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause genomic instability. </strong>Having escaped methylation and the heterochromatinization (densely packaging) they can participate in abnormal recombination causing reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Other mechanisms involve: transposition of the copied repetitive element, disrupting coding sequences, activating other genes that are near, directly or by activating ‘cryptic’ promoters. Other proofs of this genomic instability are chromosomal abnormalities like insertions and deletions.</p>
<p>Many human cancers show this mechanism. In ICF syndrome DNMT3B mutations cause hypomethylation of the pericentromeric repeats, thus disrupting genome stability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes, like Igf2 (insulin like growth factor 2 gene), express themselves in a parent of origin manner. In this case, the Igf2 gene is paternally expressed and maternally silenced in normally methylated cells.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at the ICR (imprinting center region), whether hyper- or hypomethylation, can disrupt the normal expression of the imprinted gene: either both alleles are expressed or both are silenced. In Wilm’s tumor the loss of imprinting, meaning the hypermethylated maternal allele, is an early, pre-neoplastic event, promoting abnormal growth in childhood and the development of kidney tumour. In this <strong>case both Igf2 alleles are expressed</strong>.</p>
<p>The normal paternal ICR is methylated, H19 (gene coding for a long non-coding RNA) being inactive and the enhancers activating the Igf2 allele.</p>
<p>The normal maternally inherited ICR is not methylated and insulated by CTCF, a zinc-finger protein, acting as transcriptional regulator. Downstream enhancers will activate the H19 gene, while this Igf2 allele is not activated.</p>
<p>When imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster, the hypermethylated maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele: H19 being inactive and Igf2 being active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, included in the intracellular chemotherapeutic agents and commercialized under the name of Dacogen by the Japenese. In the Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” decitabine and azacitidine are the two DNA-demethylating agents presented as being on the market. Decitabine is a hypomethylator, replication dependent. It is a nucleoside analogue used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.  After entering into the host's DNA, DNMT inhibitors bind DNA methyltransferases irreversible.</span></p>
<p><span>Erasing the abnormal epigenetic marks that cause cancer and the presence or absence of these signals being mitotically heritable, have as effect the appearance of cellular clones that will be normal. The exact mechanism of action is still unclear.</span></p>
<p><span>In the mentioned article, the breakthrough in treating cancer is considered the fact that new epigenetic acting therapeutic agents influence strictly and directly the abnormal cells, leaving 'untouched' the normal ones.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation <strong>can have</strong> enduring effects on the epigenome, because these modifications are mitotically heritable. So the effects of treatment last indeed beyond the drug intake, because the epigenetic marks associated with cancer are consistently and forever removed. In the cell 'treated' as well as in all its daughter cells.</p>
<p>Also, in the mentioned article, added to the fact that a solid tumor was treated, came the fact that routine antitumor therapies had better results in lung cancer patients previously treated with a combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Maybe the modifications of the DNA methylation pattern changed the 'openness' of the DNA to other drugs, enhancing their effect, their action in the targeted tissue.</p>
<p>Patients treated should be adults. Sensitive periods are considered those in which the epigenetic marks are erased or re-established: when gametes are formed, or when the zygote, and then embryo and the primordial germ cells start developing.</p>
<p>Treating patients in such sensitive periods is inadvisable because the epigenetic marks would be disrupted, established defective and this could do more harm instead of healing.</p></div>
