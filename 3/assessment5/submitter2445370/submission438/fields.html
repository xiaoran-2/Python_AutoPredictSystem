    <h1>Submission 438 from Anon (session_user_id: c5ff08f600142fae4e3c5447b52054a725233a0b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a chemical analogue of deoxycytidine, a building block of DNA and RNA. It belongs to the class of DNA methylation inhibitors. Decitabine is activated by photophosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase and then incorporated into DNA. The incorporation of Decitabine in place of 5-methylcytosine results in the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, due to covalent bond formation between the 5-azacytosine ring of Decitabine and this enzyme. The inactivation of DNA methyltransferase leads to hypomethylation of DNA. Genes that are silenced by aberrant DNA methylation can be reactivated by treatment with Decitabine, such as <em>DCL1, CDKN2A, DAPK1</em>, etc. This is the major anti-tumor effect of Decitabine in tumor cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated CpG dinucleotide clusters that are often found in the promoter regions of mammalian genes. Methylation at CpG islands is a cellular mechanism to modulate gene expression, in that high DNA methylation at CpG islands is correlated with low transcription activity.  In cancer cells, the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are often hypermethylated, which leads to silencing of these genes. Loss of tumor suppressor gene activity is an essential step towards tumorigenesis and is a hallmark of cancer. In different types of cancers, the set of silenced tumor suppressor genes is different. Nevertheless, the end result is typically uncontrolled cell growth and malignancy. Importantly, the altered DNA methlyation pattern is maintained during cell division. Therefore, the silencing will be maintained in all tumor cells. In contrast to the hypermethylation of CpG islands of the tumor suppressor genes, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome tends to be attenuated in cancer. In normal cells, these regions are usually imprinted by DNA methylation. It serves to silence the transposon components within them, which possess the ability to transpose. Methylated cytosine also tends to mutate into thymidine, which also contribute to the prevention of transposition. The repetitive elements are sometimes the transcription activator of retrovirus. Methylation of these elements can effectively silence their activity. Therefore, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements plays an important role in maintaining genome stability. Hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cells will lead to the activation of these components and in turn, cause genomic instability. Again, unstable DNA (chromosome abnormality) is a hallmark of cancer and contributes to the disease progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is defined as the parental allele-specific expression of some genes. This monoallelic expression ensures that appropriate levels of the proteins encoded by imprinted genes are achieved. However, cancer cells often display loss of imprinting. For instance, the H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted and is methylated on the paternal allele, unmethylated on the maternal allele. Imprint control region (ICR) of the maternal allele is bound by CTCF and the subsequent chromatin barrier formation insulates the IGF2 promoter from transcriptional enhancers located distally from the <em>H19</em> gene. Instead, <em>H19</em> is expressed. The paternal allele, with a methylated ICR, cannot be bound by CTCF and therefore the enhancers distal to the <em>H19</em> gene can activate transcription from the IGF2 promoter. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is hypermethylated (ie, loss of imprinting), which abrogates the binding of CTCF. This leads to the activation of maternal <em>igf2</em> gene in a way similar to the paternal allele. Therefore, disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in double dose of <em>igf2</em> gene. IGF2 protein is considered a major fetal growth factor. It binds to IGF1 receptor and promotes cell growth. Overexpressed IGF2 is associated with somatic overgrowth and Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark and is mitotic heritable, which means that altered DNA methylation pattern by drugs can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Nevertheless, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). These periods of epigenetic reprogramming are known as sensitive periods. During the sensitive periods, DNA methylation of the genome decreases and imprinting are reprogrammed. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, as the drugs may change the reprogramming efficiency, disrupt the normal process and result in epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting. This could in turn lead to activation of oncogenes and eventually new cancer formation.</p></div>
