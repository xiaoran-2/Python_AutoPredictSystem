    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue CpG islands are mostly free of methylation. These islands are often found at promoter regions and keeping them free of methylation renders them optional for activation/trancription from tranasciption factors (Hassler et Egger, 2012). In many cancers hypermethylation of CpG islands are found(Hassler er Egger, 2012). For example in colon cancer where 30-40 % of proximal cancers are CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) leading to possible silencing of tumor suprressor genes and ncRNA(Migheli et Migliore, 2012). Silencing of tumor suprressors leads to tumor progression for example through proliferation, migration or resistance to anoikis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation are also often found at intergenic regions in normal tissue. Especially at repetitive sequences are often hypermethylated. In cancer these methylations can be removed leading to chromosomal instability. Instability can then lead to translocations, increased copy numbers or deletions of oncogenes or tumor suprressor genes(Hassler et Egger, 2012, Coursera 2013). Intergenic methylations may also repress trancriptional noise and silince alternative promotors or splice sights(Hassler et Egger 2012). Disruption can the course ineffective/nonfunctioning transcription of tumor suppressors. The overall effect of these changes may again lead to increased proliferation, migration or in solid tumors EMT (endothelial mesenchymal transition). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor) is a paternal imprented gene, leading to expression only from the paternal allele (Pham et al, 1998). Monoallelic expression comes about from epigenitic modifications, both methylation and histone modifications. In the example of the H19/lgf2 cluster the imprent control region is methylated at the paternal allele, because of this an insulater protein (CTCF) is not able to bind to the region. When CTCF is not bound, enhancers downstream of Igf2 are able to work on the promoter leading to its expression preferential from the paternal side. The other way around on the maternal site, the imprent control region are unmethylated, CTCF is bound and the enhancers work on the H19 promoter instead (Coursera, 2013). Loss of imprenting (LOI) at the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to disease since its closely related to the Cdkn1c cluster. Cdkn1c is restricting growth and is maternal imprented. Through LOI of Cdkn1c two paternal imprented genes can lead to growth without restriction. This syndrome is called Beckwith-Weidermanns syndrome. These patients are also prone to childhood tumors such as Wilms tumor. A lot of genes involved in growth are imprented and disruption leads to possible activation or silencing of oncogenes and tumor suprressor genes (Coursera, 2013, Wikipedia,2013)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It is incorporated into the DNA an leads to inhibition of DNA methyl tranferase (Coursera 2012, Wikipedia 2013). Through delution within each cell-cycle epigenitic methylation is decreased. This leads possible reactivation of tumor suprressor genes. Since the drug is targeting dividing cells the effect will be more prone in fast dividing cancers cell, leaving normal tissue less affected (Coursera 2013, The Economist 2012).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic marcs are inheritble through mitosis, the demethylation can be stable  through subsequent cell generations. In sensitive periods the epigentic marks are "reprogrammed" in the devolping sperma and oocytes and the devoping featus (Coursera 2013). Targeting epigentic enzymes in these sensitive periods may lead to the disruption of reprogramming or the laying down of new markers in the devolping featus. Pregnant women and propably men and women in the fertile age should not be treated with these agents, or prober care with freezing of oocytes before treatment start should be done.</p></div>
