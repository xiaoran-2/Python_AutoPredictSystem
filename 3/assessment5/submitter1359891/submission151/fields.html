    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes, and are mostly unmethylated in a normally functioning cell. DNA methylation at CpG inslands are generally thought to silence gene expression. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, in contrast to the normal cell. This may contribute to disease in a number of ways, including silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of the CpG islands at the promoters of these genes, which can contribute to tumorgenesis. Another mechanism is the hypomethylation of CpG islands of oncogenes, which are normally methylated.</p>
<p>In a normally functioning cell, DNA is mostly methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and this provides genomic stability. In contrast, cancer cells show mostly unmethylated patterns in these regions, which can have the effect of creating illegimate combinations of chromosomes and aberrant expression of genes, leading to overexpression of ocogenes or silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption to epigenetic imprinting mechanisms can contribute to cancer, and one well known example is the H19/Igf2 cluster and its association with Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney cancer.</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, this methylation of ICR leads to expression of Igf2 gene mediated by the enhancer elements and repression of H19 gene which remains methylated. In contrast, on the maternal allele, unmethylated ICR leads to the insulator protein CTCF binding of ICR, which prevents Igf2 expression mediated by the enhancers. This results in the enhancers acting on H19, leading to its expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of this cluster is found to be methylated on the maternal allele, resulting in the repression of H19 and expression of Igf2 on this allele. This leads to the disease because the expression of H19 and Igf2 are no longer balanced as in the normal case, but skewed towards more Igf2 and less H19. Because Igf2 is a growth related gene, its overexpression has been linked to tumorgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine works as a DNA methyle transferase (DNMT) inhibitor, stopping DNMTs from acting as a methylating agent during cell replication. Normally DNMTs such as DNMT1 are free to copy methylation status from cell to cell, but with a DNMT inhibitor such as Decitabine, DNMTs are not released after being used at a cell. The result is that over many rounds of mitosis, there is an increased number of cells where DNMT has not worked to apply methylation. Since demethylation or inhibition of methylation is associated in general with gene expression, while DNA hypermethylation is often associated with tumorigenesis, Decitabine may work by reversing this, and in particular by expressing tumour supressor genes which may have been silenced in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A drug which targets DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, beyond the period of drug treatment. This is because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so progenies of epigenetically treated cells can remain in the treated state if they are allowed to proliferate rather than untreated cells. However, there are periods of the organism's lifecycle, during which the epigenome is remodelled, and altering DNA methylation state may have an adverse effect during these periods. These periods when the epigenetic marks are actively reset are called the sensitive periods. These include the preimplantation period (the zygote is developing but is yet to be implanted in the uterine wall), early post-implantation period, and the period of primordial germ cells development. Since methylation states are actively cleared during these periods, drugs which interfere with this process may adversely affect the embyo in the case of pre or post implantation periods, or pass on adverse epigenetic modifications to the next generation in the case of the primordial germ cells development period. </p></div>
