    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. In mammals it occurs at CpG dinucleotides, that can be clustered into CpG islands,  found in promoters of genes. Normally, CpG islands are not methylated, and the methylation of CpG islands is associated with gene expression silencing. By contrast, CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. In cancer cells in general the situation is the oppposite: CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, whereas CpG in intergenic regions and repeats are likely to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In general, CpG islands hypermethylation in cancer cells can be found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and it results in silencing of tumor suppressor gene expression. Since DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, silencing of tumor suppressor genes is spread to the whole population of tumor cells, giving them selective advantage comparing with normal tissues. This contributes to tumor development.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be hypomethylated in cancer cells. In normal cells the methylation of repeats and intergenic regions protect the genome from illegitimate recombination events and chromosome rearrangements, contributing to genomic stability. Methylation of repeats makes them heterochromatinized, while recombination occurs between the regions with open chtomatin. When hypomethylated in cancer cells, repetitive elements can be involved in illegitimate recombination, resulting in chromosome rearrangements. Secondly, being hypomethylated, repetitive elements can be activated, i.e. transpose throughout the genome and consequently activate the expression the neighboring genes, since repetitive elements usually include strong transcription activating sequences. These genes can include possible oncogenes. The activation of oncogenes due to repetitive elements transposition could contribute to tumorogenesis.</p>
<p>Altogether, the effect of DNA methylation on cancer is contex-dependent: there is hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes and genome-wide hypomethylation of repetitive elemets and intergenic regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 is a cluster of imprinted genes, including imprint control regoin (ICR), located between H19 and Igf2 genes. ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele and methylated in paternal allele (i.e. paternally imprinted). In maternal allele in the absence of ICR methylation CTCF insulator protein binds to ICR and insulates Ifg2 gene from the downstream enhancers action. As a result Igf2 gene is not expressed from the maternal allele. In contrast, in the paternal allele ICR is methylated and CTCF is not able to bind it. In this case there's no insulation of Igf2 gene from the enhancers and Igf2 is actively expressed due to its activation by enhancers.</p>
<p>When imprinting is disrupted, i.e. in case there are two paternal-like H19/Igf2 allele with ICR methylation, Igf2 gene is expressed from both alleles and its expression level is increased comparing with normal cells. Igf2 is an oncogene, encoding insulin-like growth factor II. Overdose of Igf2 expression results in fetal and postnatal overgrowth and embryonic and childhood tumors. Among other things, Igf2 overexpression due to disrupting of imprinting may result in tumorgenesis, such as Wilms' tumors in the kidney, where Igf2 gene is overexpressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylation agents and it represents nucleoside analog, inhiniting the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) action in division-dependent way. Decitabine is incorporated into DNA upon replication and irreversibly binds to DNMT, blocking its action. Since cancer cells are replicated more frequently, they are more likely to incorporate decitabine, comparing with normal cells, which results in DNA-demethylation in cancer cells. Decitabine demonstrates anti-neoplastic effect in low doses. It is effectively used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, which is dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. Although the precise mechanism of decitabine action is not thoroughly understood, it is believed that decitabine decreases methylation in CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, thereby activating their expression and interfering tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation are not specific and they affect the methylation in all the dividing cells, not only in the cancer ones. This could results in long-term consequences of the agents affecting DNA methylation to epigenome in a whole, that can not be  appropriately predicted. Specifically, the use of drugs altering DNA methylation for cancer treatment should be considered and limited during sensitive periods in development. Sensitive periods are the periods of active remodelling of the epigenome (where removal and the establishment of epigenetic marks take place) that can be affected by the environment. There are two main sensitive periods: 1) the period of primordial germ cell development, and 2) the period of early embryonic development - preimplantation and postimplantation periods. The use of drugs altering DNA methylation during sensitive periods (f.e. in young patients and especially in pregnant women) is inadvisable since it may disrupt epigenetic marks important for normal development, and it could have long-term consequences for the patients and their offsprings. Moreover, since there are evidences assuming transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, the effect of drugs altering DNA methylation can be manifested in the offsprings of the patients being treated.</p></div>
