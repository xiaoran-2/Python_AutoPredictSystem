    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is an imprinted gene cluster whose expression has been shown to be linked to the formation of Wilm's tumor, a tumor of the kidney most often found in children between the ages of 3-5. H19 and Igf2 in normal somatic cells are monoallelically expressed; H19 is expressed from the maternal chromosome, and Igf2 from the paternal chromosome. Epigenetic regulation of the H19/Igf2 cluster is dependent on methylation of the Igf2 imprint control region (ICR), normally present on the parental chromosome and absent on the maternal, resulting in silencing of paternal H19, while the maternal version is expressed. H19 can recruit downstream enhancers, denying their use to Igf2, thereby silencing maternal Igf2. Because the paternal H19 is silenced by ICR methylation, the downstream enhancers can help express paternal Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, it has been found that methylation is absent on the maternal ICR, leading to silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2 on the maternal chromosome. Igf2 is active in promoting growth; the extra expression of Igf2 can lead to overgrowth and tumor development. Conversely, methylation of the paternal ICR and complete silencing of Igf2 can also lead to other issues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is the deoxy derivative of azacitidine, a cytidine analogue and a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in treating myeloid dysplastic syndromes. It functions in a similar way to azacitidine, by inhibiting DNA methyltranserfases in low doses and also through cytotoxicity to abnormal hematopoetic cells. Decitabine can covalently bind to DNA methyltransferases, thereby inhibiting their action, and azacitidine has also been shown to remove DNA methylation <em>in vitro. </em>Its cytotoxicity derives from its ability to be incorporated at high concentrations into DNA or, in azacytidine's case, RNA, in highly proliferative cells. When incorporated into DNA, decitabine and azacitidine will bind DNA methyltransferases, thereby inhibiting both transcription and DNA synthesis, leading to cell death. Azacitidine, as a ribonucleotide, is more often incorporated into RNA, and when inserted can inhibit tRNA function, translation, and can also cause defective methylation, also leading to cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Due to the activity of Dnmt1, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable - therefore, if DNA methylation is altered in a cell, the alterations will be preserved  and result in lasting effects on the epigenome of that cell line. If an epigenetic alteration is made on a wide scale such that the cells are more vulnerable to chemotherapeutic agents, then it follows that the new vulnerability will be present in future cell generations. However, there are periods when the epigenome is being reprogrammed, termed sensitive periods, such as early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. During these periods, the genome is rapidly demythlated, and remethylated (reprogrammed) again. Using epigenetic drugs on a woman who is pregnant with a child or has the potential to be bears the risk of disrupting the epigenetic reprogramming of the embryo, or of the primordial germ cells in the embryo. Disruption of epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods, then, can result in abnormal epigenetics, potentially leading to genetic diseases or other abnormalities or problems in the developing child, or (through the primordial germ cells) in later generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a large component of epigenetic control. The methylation always occurs at CpG dinucleotide sequences, and when clustered together, they form CpG islands, which are usually found in promoter regions. These regions are generally protected from methylation, as opposed to single CpGs, which are more freely methylated, and methylation of CpG islands often results in subsequent silencing of the associated gene. In cancer, the methylation is reversed; free CpGs are less methylated, and CpG islands tend to be more hypermethylated. Of particular consequence is hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes, which results in their silencing and tumor growth, as well as selective hypomethylation of proto-oncogene promoters that result in overproduction of growth factors and other cancer-causing agents. Meanwhile, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypermethylated, thereby helping to stabilize the genome. Loss of methylation in these areas can lead to illegitimate chromosomal recombinations or heightened transposon or cryptic promoter activity, leading to mutation and misexpression of genes and increasing potential for disease; misexpression of proto-oncogenes or tumor suppresor genes can potentially lead to cancer.</p></div>
