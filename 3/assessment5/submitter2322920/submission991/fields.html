    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually associated with promotor regions, but are generally unmethylated in animals. Methylation of CpG islands silences the associated gene(s). In cancer, CpG islands are more likely to become hypermethylated, especially in tumour supressor genes. This silencing of tumour supressor genes through the methylation of CpG island is associated with distinct types of cancer (for example colorectal cancer) and is called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). Furthermore, the silencing can also spread from the CpG Islands to about 2 kb ecompassing CpG island shores.The DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps in maintaining genomic integrity. Methylation of intergentic regions silences cryptic start sites or cryptic splice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements, on the other hand, prevents transposition of the repetitive elements and unwanted recombination, as well as silencing of transcriptional interference from strong promoters. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated genome-wide, increasing genomic instability through unwanted recombination between repeats, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), preventing CTCF from binding. This allows the methylation to spreadto the promoter of the H19 long non-coding RNA (lnc-RNA), which allows the enhancers to access lgf2.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind. This prevents the enhancers from activating lgf2 and enables the lnc-RNA H19 to be transcribed. There is also a secondary enhancement of H19 by the enhancers. As many other imprinted genes, Igf2 is involved in growth. A disruption in the imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster results in an upregulation of Igf2, exessviely promoting growth. In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome the maternal allele is not slienced and expresses Igf2 like the paternal allele. There are three main causes of this. First, the imprinting of the paternal gene can be lost by mutation or deletion. Second, in uniparental disomoy one the chromosome of one parent occurs in two copies. And third, the imprinting can be lost through epigenetic disruption, but these cases are rare. As mentioned before, Igf2 acts as a growth factor and it's upregulation contributes to the overgrowth found in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor (alco called DNA-demethylating agent in the article). DNMTs are involved in the <em>de novo</em> methylation and methylation maintenance of DNA. Inhibiting DNMTs will result in hypomethylation of the DNA. DNMT inhibitors are not specifc in their action and are primarily used for cancer that depends on the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes (e.g. haematological malignancies. The actual mechanism of how they affect DNMTs is still unclear. DNMTs have traditionally been used in high doses in the 1970s, but were found to be very non-specific and toxic at those levels. Smaller doses seem to have a much greater anti-neoplastic effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be passed on to daughter cells. Changing the methylation status of the cancer cells may not affect the whole cancer right away, but the effect might spread and make the cancer cells more susceptible to subsequent treatments.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods occur twice, during gametogenesis and then again during embryogenesis. In somatic cells, the epigenetic marks are maintained.  During the sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are removed to reset the cells (e.g. paternal imprinting) and then re-established.  The re-establishing of the epigenetic marks makes the cells vunerable to changes. Treating patients with drugs that affect the establishment of epigenetic marks during sensitive periods, either pregnant women or childern while their gametes are still forming, can alter the epigenetic landscape of the unborn child, causing severe problems.</p></div>
