    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG Islands are generally unmethylated or hypomethlyated in normal cells.  In cancer cells, CpG Islands are more likely to be methylated than normal cells.  Not all CpG Islands are methylated, but there is locus-specific DNA hypermethylation.  The opposite is true for intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  That is, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to by methylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The CpG Islands hypermethylated in cancer cells tend to be in the promotors of tumor suppressing genes.  The hypermethylation causes the silencing of these genes thus decreasing the supression of the tumor growth.  The disruption caused by the hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells contributes to genomic instability.  The genomic instability can include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promotors and distruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells can to display loss of imprinting due to the hypermethylation of imprint control regions.  This can be seen in the H19/IGF2 cluster example. Note imprint control regions can also be hypomethylated in imprint control regions as well.  This example, however, is a case of hypermethylation.   In a normal cell, the imprint control region is methylated on paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  This means that  Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele and expressed on the paternal allele.  in a Wilm's tumor, the imprint control region is hypermethylated thus also causing expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele.  That is Igf2, a growth promotor,  will be overexpressed (double dose) in a Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which is defined by the paper as a precursor to acute myelogenouse leukaemia.  If a gene is silenced due to methylation, then a demethyaltion agent, like Decitabine, will inhibit methylation thus permitting the expression of the previously silenced gene.  If the gene, which is now being expressed, is a tumor suppression gene, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  That is, epigenetic changes (such as DNA methylation) are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Early development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development are defined as the sensitive periods of development.  These are considered the sensitive periods as this is the time in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs (i.e. active arasing of epigentic changes).  During both these periods DNA methylation decreases on both the maternal and paternal genomes (although at different rates) and furthermore imprinted genes also have a decrease in methylation during PGC devleopment.</p>
<p>Treating a patient during sensitve periods would be inadvisable as it could be disruptive to the natural epigenitc reprogramming that occurs during this time.  For example, paternal epigenomic reprogramming happens at a faster rate than maternal epigenomic reprogramming during normal development.  Treating a patient during a sensitive period may alter the relative rate of the maternal and paternal epigenomic reprogramming which may have unknown consequences.</p></div>
