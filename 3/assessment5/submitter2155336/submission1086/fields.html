    <h1>Submission 1086 from Anon (session_user_id: 5f214bda1fc89dcd09d36dbd2f538bf823ebe201)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is DNA- demethylating agent. It acts by inhibiting DNA methyletransferase and therefore hypomethylates the DNA. Decitabin belongs to  DNMTi ( DNA methyletransferase inhibitors) class of enzymatic epigenetic regulators.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabene is a nucleoside analouge which irreversibaly binds DNMTs after they  are incorporated into DNA. Binding of decitabine to DNMT, stops it from copying methyle group on the new daughter strand.  Therefore action of decitabene is replication dependent. As a result, after each cell division DNA becomes less and less methylated.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabene's anti-tumour effect can be understood by it's demethylating action and replication dependency. As we know that tumour cells divide much more rapidly than the normal cells, decitaben affects these cells much more severely. As a result use of decitabene suppresses the tumour growth by demethylation of tumour suppressor genes. Demethylation of tumour suppressor genes means they will be active and will suppress tumour growth.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing, when found in promoters. And this is the basis for different epigenetic phenominon such as imprinting, inactivation of X chromosome or the formation of heterochromatin. Also it is essential for the viability of the cell. Normally CpG islands are tend to be protected from methylation but small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated. Most CpG islands retain unmethylated status. </p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated and this results in silencing the tumour suppressor genes. And silencing of tumour suppressor genes result is tumourogenesis by rapidly dividing cells. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is a very effective way of silencing tumour suppressor genes. And these epimutations are rapidly selected, by giving compatitive advantage to the cells which carry them. So the methylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes is one of the major contributers to the disease.</p>
<p>Normal function of DNA methylation in intergeneic regions and repetitive elements is to mentain genomic stability. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated and are heterochromatinised. Silencing of repeats prevent mutagenic transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>But in cancer, genome -wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats result in genomic instability, by causing:</p>
<p>  1-Illegitimate recombination between repeats, that cause deletions, reciprocal translocations and    insertions.</p>
<p>  2-Activation of repeats and transposition</p>
<p>  3-Activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>Genome- wide hypomethylation creates open cromatin structure, where repeats on different chromosomes can pair and result in illegitimate recombination. It also allows repeats to jump freely in the genome and express. This genomic instability contributes in many ways to the development of cancer, because it can change and disrupt normal gene expression in many ways.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells show loss of imprinting. That means either both parental alleles are expressed or both are silenced. </p>
<ul><li>In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, Imprint control region is methylated at paternal allele and unmethylated on maternal allele. When it is unmethylated at maternal allele, CTCF binds as an insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele.</li>
</ul><ul><li>On the paternal allele imprint control region is methylated and CTCF is not binding to it to insulate, so enhancers can act on Igf2 gene and this gene is expressed.</li>
<li>In Wilm's tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 clusture is disrupted by hypermethylation at imprint control region of maternal allele as well. And this results in expression of Igf2 on maternal allele too, and cell will have double dose of Igf2 in comparison to the normal cell. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, this associates with Wilm's tumour.</li>
<li>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 clusture result in the expression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal alleles. Since Igf2 is growth promoter, its<strong> double dose</strong> contributes in the development of tumour. This loss of imprinting occures very early in tumourogenesis and found in wide array of tumour types.</li>
