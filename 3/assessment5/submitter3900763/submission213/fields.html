    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<div>For most genes two working copies are inherited,<strong> </strong>one from the father and one from the mother. With imprinted genes either the gene from the mother or the one from the father is epigenetically silenced. The imprinted genes resist reprogramming in early development . Imprinted genes occur in clusters and each cluster has its own Imprint Control Centre ((ICR). An example is theH19/ Igf2 cluster. Downstream of this is the ICR for the cluster followed by the H19 promoter and finally by enhancers. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and the enhancers can loop back to stimulate the activity of the Igf2 gene. In contrast, in the maternal cluster the unmethylated ICR is able to bind the insulator protein CTCF whic prevents the enhancer looping back to the Igf2. The enhancers now act upon the H19 promoter. The linked clusters H19/Igf2 and Kcnq1 (both on chromosome11) can have epigenetic changes which lead to the loss of a tumour/ growth supressor action and upregulation of an oncogene, with growth promoting action- the cause of Wilm's tumour.</div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a disease , initially thought to be the result of direct genetic damage<strong>,</strong><strong> </strong>subsequently the effecoffer epigenetic malfunctions have been found to be involved in cancers. In particular,errors inmethylation a and/ or demethylation of DNA.  Decitabine belongs to a class of compounds called DNAmethyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). As its name implies these prevent the transfer of methyl groups to their site of action (preventing e.g. Cytosine to methyl cytosine) .Decitabine has been approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine is a  nucleoside analogue and can be incorporated into DNA upon replication of the DNA. If the cell is cancerous methylation of  the daughter cell will be disrupted and more generally the presence of a foreign nucleoside in the genome will be deleterious and the progression of the cancer disrupted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">CpG islands occur in the genome in areas of high CG contenThey are often associated with the promoters of genes (promoters are at the start of genes where transcription machinery acts). In general for a cell behaving normally genes which are active ("on") will have their promoters un-methylated, whereas genes which are inactive  ("off") are likely to have their promoters methylated . In cancer cells there are two overall causes of disruption- genetic I.e. mutations in the DNA and epi mutations. Disruption of methylation at CpG islands belongs to the latter. In a normal cell the CpG islands in general are methylated, the converse occurs ib cancer cells. In particular methylation inactivates tumour suppressor genes. Methylation is mitotically heritable and so does not have to be established de novo for each generation of cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">In normal cells CpG islands are unmethylated but intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. If the intergenic regions are unmethylated but the cell is cancerous there is the possibility of cryptic promoters and cryptic splice sites being active leading to inappropriate interference with normal splicing of exons and trasposition in the case of unmethylated repeats. This disruption of normal cellular behaviour will result in a multitude of forms of disease through the inability of the cell to transcribe correctly from RNA to protein .</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">Methylation helps to maintain genomic integrity by promoting the mutation of methyl cytosine to thymine thus disrupting the nucleotide sequence of a potential transposon. Repeats can be associated with strong promoters which could cause interference in normal transcription. Methylation of the repeat prevents this.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
