    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a single methyl group to cytosine at position 5 which in mammals exclusively happen only on cytosines preceding guanine (CpG) in the DNA sequence. CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>Genes usually have their transcription start sites flanked with CpG islands. Cytosines in these CpG islands are unmethylated which makes them less susceptible to mutational pressure and maintain them open for gene expression. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The reason why these regions are kept methylated is because it helps to maintain genomic integrity avoiding deletion and insertions, to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. </p>
<p>On the contrary, cancer cells present hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG island hypermethylation in cancer is found in tumour suppressor genes promoters. This helps to silence these genes and consequently, it allows cancer cell to proliferate in an exacerbated way as the apoptosis is downregulated and cell cycle is no longer controlled.On the other hand, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements allows iligitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats (now, repeats can make a copy of themselves and jump through the genome) and disruption to neighbouring genes. These lead to genomic instability and consequently, to transcriptional aberrations which favors proliferation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Also, the contribution of DNA methylation to cancer is context and stage dependent. Different tumours have different dependant on one or other of these DNA methylation aberrations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is a single region of DNA that regulates expression of the imprinted genes that can act over hundreds of kilobases. An ICR is a region of DNA that is differentially methylated in the paternal and maternal chromosome. The methylation of ICR can have silencing or promoting effects on gene expression.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster can be represented as below:</p>
<p> ---------(Igf2)----------------(ICR)----------------(H19)-------------------(Enhancers)------------------</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated so an insulator protein called CTCF binds to ICR.The Igf2 is no longer reached by the downstream enhancers which now act on H19, enhancing H19 gene expression. </p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated so CTCF can no longer bind ICR. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter silencing it. Now, the enhancers can act on Igf2, promoting Igf2 gene expression. </p>
<p>In the Wilm's tumour, ICR is methylated  on both maternal and paternal allele. In that context, Igf2 gene is expressed from both allele leading to overexpression of Igf2. As this gene acts promoting growth, cancer cells are now able to divide and proliferate in an exacerbated way. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. Particularly, Decitabine helps to demethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. The drug provide nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA. When DNA methyltransferase bind the nucleoside analogues  it is irreversible bound and can no longer be released. This drug is depedant on cell division and DNA replication. As cancer cells replicate a lot, they tend to be more sensitive to this drug. As DNA is hypermethylated in CpG island of tumour suppresing gene promoters, if you remove the methylation, these genes are no longer silence and cell cycle can be controlled again. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically and meiotically heritable. As a consequence, if an alteration in DNA methylation occurs in one cell, it can be passed to this cell to its daughter cells (Mitotically) or even more, if an alteration take place during primordial germ cells development, it can be passed through the next generation of individuals (Meiotically). A sensitive period is the period when active remodelling of epigenome is taking place. In this period, epigenetic marks are removed and placed again. Particularly, The first sensitive period is the primordial germ cells development to production of mature gametes period. The second sensitive period is preimplantation to postimplantation period. </p>
<p>Administration of drugs that alter DNA methylation would be inadvisable in these sensitive periods because this is a period where epigenetic marks are established. An alteration in DNA methylation, such as demethylating agents, could lead to mature gametes with hypomethylated genome and consequently, genomic inestability or could lead to gametes with altered methylation that can contribute to alterations in the adult life of the new individuals.</p></div>
