    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are weakly methylated. However, in cancer cells some CpG islands and their 2kb neighborhdoods (CpG shores) are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation progresses in time and the identity of methylated CpG regions is specific to the tumor type. Expression of tumor suppresor genes that are often localized in CpG rich genomic regions is decreased or stopped.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually highly methylated. However, in cancer cells they are hypomethylated, implying instability of both genome (active transposable elements in repeats) and transcriptome (novel transcripts due to nonmethylated intergen. regions).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On mathernal allele, Ctfc gene and H19 promoter region are NOT methylated and insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. On pathernal allele, Ctfc and H19 promoter are methylated (not expressed) implying Igf2 imprinting (only father variant is expressed).</p>
<p>Mutation or delation or (rarely) change in imprinting can cause expresssion of both Igf2 alleles that follows Igf2 overdose and related probles (overgrowth, Wilm's tumour)., . </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors and it is used as to treat the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>It binds DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA and therefore reduces methylation. </p>
<p>It could correct hypermethylation of CpG islands with tumor-suppressing genes. However, a mechanism of action is still an area of active research. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenome is mitotically heritable therefore DNA methylation change will be propagated to mitotic daughter cells and therefore can last  beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is epigenomic reprogramming, particularly time after removal of old epigenetic marks when new methylations patterns are being established. That occurs during the early embryo development (blastocyst - epiblast) and the treatment could inhibits that process.</p>
