In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation normally would be for silencing genes that are no longer needed. CpG islands are responsible for activating the gene so methylating CpG islands means the gene is not going to activate. in cancer the methylation of CpG islands are changed, depending on weither it was methylated or unmethylated, some cancers are due to unmethylation when methylation should happen, and others are due to methylation when unmetheylation should happen. some parts of the dna should be methelated to prevent extra genes replication this reapeats are silenced by methylation, in cancer these repeats are no longer methylated which means the repeats are going to continues producing when they should be stoped and reduring the RNA corrupted. one\ce RNA is corrupted it is copied into sisters cells that divid in an unregulated manner.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<div> in wilm's tumor lgf2 is active on both alleles and h19in inactive on both alleles and this leads to loss of expression for growth promoting genes</div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>altering DNA methylation permanatly can last because as the cell becomes helthy and devides the methylation is irreversable which means the new daughter cells cannot reverse it in case it needs (which in my opinion might result in a defferent type of disease)</p>
<p>sensitive periods are during 2 stages the development of the oocyte and the development of germ cells in a fetus changing the methylation during this period could result in a permanant ireversable change in DNA methylation for ever</p>
