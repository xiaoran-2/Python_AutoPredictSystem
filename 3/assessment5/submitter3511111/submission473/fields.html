    <div class="field-value"><p>To begin addressing this issue must know detailed definition of methylation which according Hartwell (2008), refers to the addition of a methyl group to a molecule in particular a DNA sequence which is constituted as we know by bases such as adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine, which links are formed according to their general structure of our genome, so either this process can lead to alterations in gene transcription without requiring an alteration in DNA sequence, one of the mechanisms responsible for phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to the environment along with the susceptibility of this depending on environmental conditions. May also be methylated gene products, ie, proteins, regulating their function well, this simply articulates with the fact that this is a process that uses the addition or change of chemical structure of a methyl group which confers special characteristics in function because as you know the general process of our body is the decoding of the information contained in DNA and RNA translated to produce proteins specific function.</p>
<p><br />Based on the foregoing and to Hartwell (2008) the methylation status of some genes can be used as a marker of teratogenicity. In many tumor cells promoter hypermethylation coupled with loss of heterozygosity in a single locus resulting in the loss of gene function and begins to develop tumor transformation rules that determine which genes are methylated in the pathogenesis of a particular type cancer based on DNA methylation markers that are highly specific and are capable of detecting common types of tumors, Keep in mind that the relationship with methylation cancer is closely related with the environment. THANK YOU  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The process of imprinting the overall process may have errors because as you know we function as a single functional unit in which if carried out wrong step will trigger a problem in the final product constutucion, thus post-translational modifications of histones associated with malignancies and clear this interrupt imprinting in early times has a major effect and triggers an uncontrolled multiplication chain stop sequence, in addition to this modification is reversible occurring in its amino-terminal tail and include acetylation of lysines and arginines, lysines methylation, phosphorylation of serine and ubiquitination of lysine among others, these chemical modifications are mediated by enzymes such as histone acetyl transferases, methyl transferases histones, histone deacetylases and histone demethylases among others. It has been proposed that a combination of different histone modifications may participate in regulation of chromatin functions referring in particular to the extent of the pattern on the methylation of both the maternal and paternal allele, in addition to this we must account how these factors are closely related to the environment and conditions. Our group, among others, has contributed to the description of alterations of these post-translational modifications of histones in cancer. (Hartwell. 2008) et al. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In reading talked about some medicines that treat the source of the problem since as mentioned in reading health professionals have tried to link the treatment to a plane more visible is symptomatic and has attempted to cure the disease from the more superficial, which is not quite true as has been discussed for example the treatment of the expression or inhibition of the expression of the transcription products of the protein that is specific role and systemic level, reading mentioned that future research should turn a deeper level than the symptomatic treatment should be approached a plane from the same genetic code, ie talking about drugs that regulate the expression of either stopping or minimizing it, this drug is been raised as possible as in the above studies there has been a significant decrease in pathological manifestation in question.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This has been an innovative and sometimes does not go to the source of the problem or what is causing the pathology in question. Epigenetic drugs that exploit an innate way nature gives us as it is to be based on the adaptive characteristic of our body speaking from the standpoint of evolutionary and systemic, considering that our environment affects our lives in many ways one of them speaks about the diseases that are related to epigenetics and even more from the point of view that our genetic code is like a switch that turns on and off genes as the need of the body and this in relation to internal and external conditions and that these is going to trigger conditions such as cancer moreover these drugs are based on the expression or transcription factors and modifiable such as DNA methylation, which as we know have periods of high sensitivity as the case related to the environment and this point is based on a very important event which is more sensitive to some kind of treatment such as is proposed in the article as it would have increased sensitivity to this.
