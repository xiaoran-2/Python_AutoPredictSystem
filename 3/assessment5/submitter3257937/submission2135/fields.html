    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state (Recommended resource (RR) Hassler et al. 2012). In a cancer cell promotor CpG Islands become hypermethylated which is usually associated with gene silencing. When tumour supressor genes are silenced because of hypermethylation, cancer can develop (lecture). Other genes can be silenced as well, changing the normal expression of the cell. For example, in DNA repair genes. Changes in the expression of DNA repair genes are involved in cancer (BRCA - Breast and Ovarian cancer) (lecture/ common knowledge), but also in for example Werner syndrome an autosomal recessive disease causing premature aging (WRN)  (<span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Jennifer Knoch, York Kamenisch, Christian Kubisch and Mark Berneburg (2012) Rare hereditary diseases with defects in DNA-repair. </span><em style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Eur J Dermatol</em><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;"> 22(4): 443-55)</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">.</span></p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often methylated, silencing the repeats and intergenic regions. In cancer hypomethylation is observed, which results in active repeats and intergenic regions. The DNA is not so tightly packed anymore, so that it is accessible for enzymes. The main consequence is genomic instabillity (illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promotors and disruption of neighbouring genes). Genomic instability is often found in cancer in which genomic instability is probably studied most (all information provided during the lecture). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal situation, the DMR 5' of the H19 promotor is methylated which spreads to the H19 promotor, blocking it from CTCF binding. When CTCF can't bind enhancers can activate IGF2. Therefore the paternal IGF2 is expressed. </p>
<p>The maternal allele has no methylation at the H19 gene and therefore CTCF can bind and H19 is expressed. With CTCF the enhancers can't bind and IGF2 is not expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele is behaving like a paternal allele. So in this case the maternal IGF2 is expressed. IGF2 or Insulin Growth Factor 2 is involved in growth and is considered an oncogene. With two alleles being expressed there is upregulation of IGF2 resulted in too much Growth Factors which in this case causes a childhood tumour in the kidney. </p>
<p>This Imprint region is also involved in a syndrome called Beckwith Wiedermann Syndrome which is characterized by other abnormalities related to growth, like fetal and post-natal overgrowth, a large tongue and other embryonic and childhood tumours (other then Wilm's tumour). </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent it inhibits DNMT. After incorporated in the DNA it irreversibly binds to DNMTs. When the cell then divides the methylation pattern can't be copied to the new strand anymore, because DNMT is required for that, so after replications everytime there will be less DNA methylation (dilution).</p>
<p>Some cancers arise from tumour supressor gene hypermethylation. In that case demethylating the DNA can supress the tumour activity again and stop the tumour from growing any further. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It can have effects after the treatment period as the new cells do not have methylation to pass on during mitosis to the new cells. Even is DNMT is present again and active, there are not that many strands with DNA methylation anymore (if any). And therefore it has long lasting effects. Also it can erase DNA methylation were it is actually needed which can alter genetics.</span></p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in development where epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Sensitive periods are: Primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. </p>
<p>During these periods the embryo is developing or germ cells are made. It is important that the right epigenetic marks are layed down during that time cause it will affect the embryo for the further live and the offspring in the case of germ cells. Epigenetic drugs will change what epigenetic marks will be layed down and although not much is known about this it will probably not be the right epigenetic marks. </p>
