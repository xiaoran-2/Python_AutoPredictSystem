    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         Most of the CpG Islands in our DNA are methylated.  DNA methylation is essential for imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and the formation of heterochromatin.  Cytosines in CpG islands are mostly unmethylated.  When the cytosines are kept methylation-free, cells are less susceptible to mutations and maintain normalcy.  Maintaining this level of methylation is essential for human growth and development, and "sustaining chromsomal stability".  Cells become cancerous when the promoter subsets of CpG Islands are hypermethylated.  When hypermethylation occurs, the tumor suppressor genes are permanently silenced, losing control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair.</p>
<p>          DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements "may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing, and relates to replication timing." (Epigenetics of Cancer abstract - Emerging New Concepts).  Cytosine hypomethylation creates a genome-wide loss "affecting satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in introns and inner exons." (Cancer Epigenetics article).  Hypomethylation of repeats causes the repeats to be activated.  They make copies of themselves which jump from genome to genome and transpose, activating neighboring genes.  Abnormal karyotypes will result in deletions, translocations, and insertions within the chromosomes.  This leads to genomic instability and cancer.  Hypomethylation can also cause deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>          Imprinting control regions are methylated in the paternal allele which enhances the expression of  Igf2.  The maternal allele ICRs are unmethylated and the enzyme CTCF will bind with enhancers, which will act on H19, silencing the Igf2 gene.  When the maternal allele ICRs become methylated, the combination of the paternal and maternal alleles will then result in hypermethylation of the ICRs and therefore an over-expression of the Igf2 gene.  A double expression of the Igf2 can result in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>            Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent currently being used to treat MDS.  The action of these drugs are division dependant, so the cells have to be replicating as in cancer cells.  Cancer cells derived from epigenetic changes are more open to drug treatment.  Used in lower doses, these drugs work much better at killing tumor cells because they cause DNA demethylation.  The side effects aren't so severe and therefore life expectancy is better.  We need "just enough of it to change epigenetic patterns in cancer cells to have a therapeutic effect." *  Higher doses are toxic.</p>
<p>              The goal of epigenetic therapy is to "reactivate the genes, by bringing back the expression of these genes that have been silenced in the cancer cells." *  These drugs have an effect on reducing tumor cells without touching normal cells.  These reduced tumor cells may then be more susceptible to chemotherapy.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>               Epigenetic drugs demethylate tumor cells.  The demethylated cells will be passed on to daughter and grand-daughter cells during cell division, eventually erasing the tumor cell line.  A sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals; periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.  Effects on germ cells need to be considered.  Every cell has the potential to affect other cells.  The effects of these drugs are unknown in young children and in pregnant women; "there may be some potentially serious side effects to the fetus."
