    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a molecular process that plays an important role in the control of gene expression and chromatin remodeling, participating of the activation or gene silencing through the addition of a methyl group in the C-5 position of cytosine in DNA, mainly in CpG dinucleotides, which leads to the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). In a normal cell, CpG islands (CGIs) are sporadically  methylated, participating in the initiation of DNA transcription. In cancer, high levels of DNA methylation at CGIs has been observed, especially in promoters regions related to tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation of CGIs  lead to a silencing of gene expression in this regulatory regions, resulting in a loss of function, allowing an uncontrolled cell division, infiltration to other tissues and metastasis, permitting the tumor development.<br />DNA methylation also occurs in other regions of DNA, such as the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally are highly methylated and this status is related with functions in the chromosome structures and genome stability. In the genome of cancer cell, the levels of DNA methylation in the intergenic and repetitive elements are decreased. This low levels of DNA methylation in these regions increases genome instability and modifies the transcription rates of genes that normally are repressed, for example the imprinted genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a type of epigenetic control which regulate the preferential expression of one allele according to his parental origin. In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, normal cells has the paternal allele methylated in several sites upstream of H19 at the imprinted control region (ICR), and the maternal allele unmethylated. On the maternal allele, the protein CTCF binds to the unmethylated H19 upstream region and insulates the Igf2  promoter region from an enhancer downstream of H19, association of CTCF with this ICR causes a preferential interaction of the enhancer with the H19 promoter allowing the expression of this gene on the maternal allele, whereas Igf2 expression is silenced. On the other, the paternal allele has the ICR methylated, therefore, CTCF cannot bind to this ICR, allowing the interaction of the enhancer downstream of H19 with the Igf2 promoter that will enable the expression of the Igf2 gene of the paternal allele, and the silencing of H19 expression. In Wilms tumor, paternal and maternal alleles are methylated due to loss of imprinting, resulting in a biallelic activation of Igf2 and biallelic silencing of H19. H19 has tumor suppressor function, thus its downregulation cause an increased cell growth and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, Decitabine is a cytidine analog that inhibits DNA methylation through binds and inactivation of  DNA methyltransferase enzyme during DNA replication and cell division. The effects of Decitabine on DNA methylation in cancer is rather contradictory, however at global level, this drug produce genome wide demethylation at CpG islands and selective regions of certain genes. The maintenance of hypermethylation-induced epimutations requires the continuous activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) during cell division. Hence, Decitabine could reverse epimutations produced by cancer and to reactivate tumor suppressors genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is inheritable, thus altering the pattern of DNA methylation of progenitor cells, the daughters cell can be acquire same pattern of DNA methylation. A sensitive period is a critical phase of time where it is more susceptible to changes that persist throughout adult life. In the human development there are two sensitive periods, the first during primordial germ cell development and the second in the pre-implantation early development, during which epigenetic marks are erased and set to adulthood. Treat patients during this period in not advisable because every change in epigenetic code will be transferred to the daughter cells, which still require specific reprogramming for complete development and function.</p></div>
