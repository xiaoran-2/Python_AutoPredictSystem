    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation is altered in cancer</strong></p>
<p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue.[1]</p>
<p>DNA methylation is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. However, the latest research shows that hydroxylation of methyl groups occurs rather than complete removal of methyl groups in zygote.[1]</p>
<p>In addition, DNA methylation suppresses the expression of endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA that have been incorporated into the genome of the host over time. DNA methylation also forms the basis of chromatin structure, which enables a single cell to grow into multiple organs or perform multiple functions. DNA methylation also plays a crucial role in the development of nearly all types of cancer.[1]</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is helping in the regulation of transcription. DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by hypermethylation. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease by silencing tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is Genomic Stability. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer by hypomethylation. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease by Genomic Instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer</strong></p>
<p>Some methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and cause genomic imprinting. Alterations in DNA Methylation at inprinted control regions (by Hypomethylation or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpession of growth promoting genes.[1]</p>
<p>In normal cells,The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is active. And this allows enhancers to act on Igf2 expression and make it active. The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is inactive. And this direct the enhancers to work on H19 not Igf2 expression. Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour by making the methylation pattern of the maternal allele active then have double dose of igf2. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease by Igf2 overexperssion.</p>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>How Decitabine may be used to treat cancer?</strong></p>
<p>Decitabine (trade name Dacogen), or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemically, it is a cytidine analog. [1]</p>
<p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is Nucleoside Metabolic Inhibitor. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is hypomethylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more

with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>How can drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment?</strong></p>
<p><span>Dr Stephen Baylin </span>speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. That is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.[1]</p>
