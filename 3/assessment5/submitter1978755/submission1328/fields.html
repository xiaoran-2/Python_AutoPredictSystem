    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can change dramatically during the course of cancer. Normally, at CpG islands in the gene promter, DNA is methylated to impede gene expression. This happens in the minority of CpG islands in normal cells. However, in cancer, more CpG islands than usual become methylated and to a more severe extent, disrupting expression of genes such as tumor suppressor genes. Since cancer cells need to bypass tumor suppressor genes in order to continue multiplying and growing, methylation at CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes means that cancerous cells can continue to grow until they eventually create a malignant tumor, contributing to disease. Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in an effort to maintain long-term genomic stability. DNA methylation allows for less transcriptional errors and for the genome to restrain from activating repetitive elements. DNA methylation also helps to prevent unnatural karyotypical recombination in the chromosome. This is because DNA methylation creates heterochromatin, which is much less active and more densely packaged than its active counterpart, euchromatin. SInce heterochromatin is very densely packaged, it's more difficult to be recombined aberrantly in the chromosome than euchromatin. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, so it leads to genomic instability and the creation of euchromatin. Consequently, more transcriptional errors and active repetitive elements along with genomic instability and abnormal karyotypical recombination in the chromosome can lead to a variety of effects. The activation of oncogenes as well as self-copying of repeats and transposition can promote cancerous growth and eventually lead to tumors. In combination, methylation of CpG islands and demethylation of the genome in cancer can be detrimental to a patient, allowing tumors to grow and spread without being inhibited. In conclusion, normal DNA methylation levels at both CpG islands and throughout the rest of the genome is very important for both genomic stability and the prevention of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of genetic imprinting can contribute to cancer; one example is using the H19/Igf2 cluster. The CTCF protein, which is bound to the H19 imprint control region for Igf2 plays an important role in determining whether Igf2 is expressed or not. Imprint control regions, which determine the expression statuses of genes, are active when the genes the control are inactive, and vice versa. Since DNA methylation deactivates genes, a methylated ICR means an inactive gene. On the paternal allele, CTCF is methylated along with the H19 ICR, allowing Igf2 to be expressed. However, on the maternal allele, CTCF and the H19 ICR are not methylated, so Igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumor, a kidney cancer in children, the critical balance between the two alleles is disrupted. In Wilm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles have methylated CTCF proteins and H19 ICRs, so Igf2 is expressed in both cases. This is because of a failure to imprint the two alleles properly. This leads to twice the dosage of Igf2. Since Igf2 is an insulin-like growth factor, it boosts growth within the patient's kidney, causing a detrimental effect and contributing to disease. The growth is pathological and can be severely to the child. Symptoms include hypertension and bloody urine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, or DNMTi for short. DNMTis can have a serious impact on DNA methylation within the genome. Since DNA mehylation leads to the silencing of DNA, DNA methyltransferases which transfer methyl groups to DNA silence the genes that they affect. Since Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases, it therefore prevents genes from becoming silent since the DNA will not be methylated. DNA methyltransferases bind to DNA for the lifespan of a cell. Therefore, a cell must replicate in order for the DNMTis to work properly. Since cancerous cells divide indefinitely, DNMTis are most effective within tumors and not regular cells. Also, cancerous cells must methylate CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes in order to keep dividing and growing. Since a DNMTi will prevent the CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes from being methylated, the tumor suppressor genes will be active within a cancer cell's offspring. Consequently, the tumor will stop growing and become more manageable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have a much more long-term effect on patients than normal methods of cancer treatment. This is because epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation target some healthy cells along with cancerous cells, and the change is often mitotically heritable to all of the affected cells' offspring. This means that future cell generations will have less DNA methylation than the cells that were present before treatment. While this is very useful in treating tumors, it can harm future regular cells within the patient, even if the patient recovers from the cancer. A sensitive period is when the epigenome of a person goes through active clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, making it far mores susceptible to outside environmental influences. Two senstive periods of development are pre-implantation to post-implantation development within the embryo and primordial germ cell development to mature production of the gametes. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable because modifications to the epigenome would have much more significant lifelong effects on the patient; the epigenome can be much more easily tampered with, causing abnormalities that can be harmful to the patient. It's imperative that as these drugs become more readily accessible to doctors that they are aware of when to correctly use them.</p></div>
