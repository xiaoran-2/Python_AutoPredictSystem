    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG island, sometimes in the gene promoter, is not usually methylated, and is independant to the expression of the gene. However in cancer cells this is reversed, the CpG island is hypermethylated, causing the  silencing of the specific gene. This can cause disease if the gene in question is a tumour suppressor gene. These DNA methylations of the CpG islands are mitotically heritable and progress with time, so cancer could be caused by an epigenetic state accumulated over a lifetime. CIMP (CpG Island Methlylator Phenotype) cancers occur when a set of specific genes are frequently methylated.These methlyated CpG islands also have an adverse affects on the genes in the shores (2kb) of the CpG islands, the genes here also become hypermethylated in cancer cells and so these ganes cannot be expressed, which can also lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetive elements, DNA methylation is usually observed in normal cells. However in cancer cells there is genome-wide hypomethlylation in these regions. This can result in genomic instability, repetitive elements are usually methylated to keep them silent, and stop them jumping around the genome. If methylation is lost, the euchromatin state is taken which can cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transcription of repeats and activation of promoters causing disruption to neighbouring genes. These lead to deletions, insertions and reciprocal  translocation of DNA which we can see in cancer.</p>
<p>Less common than the hypomethylation of repeats is the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters. This results in the activation of genes, for example the MicroRNA that targets PTEN is activated in glioma and therefore in glioma cancer cells there is an overall lack of PTEN, a growth inhibitor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to the very early onset of cancer. On a normal paternal allele the ICR region of the H19/lgf2 cluster is methlyated, therefore CTCF cannot bind to and insulate it, meaning that enhancers can act on the lgf2 gene and it is expressed. On a normal maternall allele, the ICR region of the H19/lgf2 cluster is unmethylated, therefore CTCF binds to the ICR and insulates it from the enhancers, so lgf2 cannot be expressed. The H19 gene gets acted on by the enhancers instead, and is expressed. However in cells of a Wilm's tumour the maternal allele also has hypermethylation at the ICR region of the H19/lgf2 cluster, meaning lgf2 is expressed from both the maternal and paternal allele. This disruption of the imprinted H19/lgf2 cluster contributes to Wilm's tumour because lgf2 is a growth promoting gene, and since the cells in a tumour have twice the normal amount of lgf2, this causes the cell to grow and divide too fast, turning it into a cancerous cell.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, used to treat Myelodysplastic syndromes, progressed to AML. Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue, which means it gets incorporated into the DNA of the cell upon it's replication. When DNMT comes along to bind to that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand of DNA, it becomes bound irreversibly and cannot be released, thus meaning DNMT cannot methylate the daughter strand. The action of Decitabine is division dependant, so Decitabine has more of an effect on cancer cells because they are dividing more rapidly than other cells. They have an antitumour effect in cancer cells where the cancer is being caused by methylation of certain tumour-suppression gene promoters, because they cause demethylation of cells, most importantly in cancer cells. Decitabine may act in other ways but we have no knowledge of what this may be.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed down to daughter cells by being copied and replicated by DNMT's. If DNA methylation is removed in a cell then the cell cannot pass on the methylation, as there is none to pass on, so methylation that switched off repeats will also be gone, causing genomic instability. This is particularly the case during senstive periods (periods where epigenetic marks are wiped and new ones are being put down). These occur during primordial germ cell development and at preimplantation. Treating patients who may be carring a preimplanted fertilised embryo would be inadvisable because the embryo would also be affected by the drugs, so the DNA methylation of the embryos cells would not be able to be put dowm, causing it harm. In teenagers whose gametes are still developing, giving them epigenetic drugs will alter the epigenetic makeup of their gametes, again potentially causing them to be epigeneticlally defective, meaning, in the worst circumstance, the person could become infertile. It is better to treat people with epigenetic drugs when they are not currently in a sentive period, as they will already have all of the epigenetic marks they need to survive.</p></div>
