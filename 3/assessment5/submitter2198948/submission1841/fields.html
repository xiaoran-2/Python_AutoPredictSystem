    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>     DNA methylation state of the CPG island is inversely related to the downstream gene expression. i.e.; CPG island methylation implies silencing of downstream gene &amp; vice versa. In normal cells, CPG islands of most of the genes are kept unmethylated  to allow gene expression or activation. Upon cancer development , one of the most epigenetic disturbances  that occur is related to DNA methylation. Hypermethylation of CPG islands is a predominant disturbance in cancerous cells which target mainly the CPG islands of the tumor suppressor genes leading to their silencing, That's why in cancerous cells disruption in DNA methylation contribute directly to disease development as it leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes leaving the oncogenes unopposed. </p>
<p><span>     Also, in normal cells the intergenic regions &amp; the repetitive elements are maintained always methylated which is believed to be a protective mechanism to maintain the genomic stability in each cell. This mechanism maintains genomic stability by inhibiting transposition of repetitive elements, undesired genetic recombinations &amp; avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. However, in cancer this mechanism is disrupted by hypomethylation at these regions. This represent a reasonable explanation about the marked genomic instability occurring in cancerous cells as observed by the multiple genetic insertions , deletions &amp; reciprocal transformations . These defects occur mainly as a result of activation these repetitive elements &amp; transposons which induce further undesired genetic combinations , disrupt certain genes or act as cryptic promoters to the downstream genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   H19/Igf2 cluster is a good example to study imprinted genes &amp; how they are altered epigenetically in cancer . In normal cells , the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR blocking the binding of CTCF insulator protein to the ICR  allowing the enhancer proteins to reach the promoter of Igf2 gene activating its expression. While the case is reversed for the maternal allele at which the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind to it hindering the enhancer proteins from reaching the Igf2 promoter keeping it silenced. Thus , the Igf2 gene is paternally expressed &amp; kept silenced on the maternal allele</p>
<p><span>    In Wilm's tumor both alleles act as being a paternal allele so we have two paternal copies of the gene .i.e.; the ICR is methylated on both alleles leading to activation of the Igf2 gene from the two alleles so the cell will has a duplicate number of copies of the Igf2 gene which is a growth promoting gene , this imbalance will then push the cell to have uncontrolled growth &amp; to develop cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span>    </span></span><span> Decitabine is a member of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors class . Its work is replication dependent ,being a nucleoside analogue, that irreversibly binds to DNA methyl transferase . Thus, it decreases DNA methylation specially of tumor suppressor genes allowing their activation that's why it possesses a certain antitumor activity. Also, it was found that it has a noticeable activity against solid tumors which is considered an advantage as solid tumors are less reachable than other tumors &amp; need the drug to have certain penetration power to the tissues. An interesting observation about  Decitabine is that in some patients who didn't show a response to the drug , showed later unexpected improved response to chemotherapeutic agent therapy , so a conclusion was drawn that Decitabine may alter the tumor cell response to chemotherapy in favor of their eradication.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     An alteration of epigenetic state by the drug ,i.e. ; inhibition of DNA methylation, will be mostly mitotically heritable in the somatic cells that's why the effect of the drug can prolong beyond the period of its use . Though a due care should be given toward the timing of the treatment by epigenetic drugs as it has to be away from the sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs in the cells &amp; then epigenetic marks are reestablished .There are two main sensitive in our life cycle ;  The early development phase in preimplantation period &amp; in the primordial germ cell development phase. In these two stages it's inadvisable to use epigenetic drugs as they may cause an alteration of the normal epigenetic make-up of the cells which is still under construction in these stages &amp; is highly sensitive to any external factor that may disrupt the process. The main fear will be towards the coming generations of the pregnant mother who was exposed to the drug in these stages .i.e her children &amp; grandchildren.</p></div>
