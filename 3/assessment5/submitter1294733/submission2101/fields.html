    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands generally occur in promoter regions while it can also occur in inton and exon regions. DNA methylation of CpG island give rise to both gene activation and silencing. In cancer DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by both hypermethylation and hypomethylation. Hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes leads to cancer. Impirinting occurs at  distinct stages during epigenetic development, Hypermethylation and hypomethylation are  associated with loss of these imprinting marks. Loss of imprinting can result in change on expression pattern of growth restricting and promoting genes which can leads to diseases.  Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found methylated state while CpG islands are unmethylated whereas in cancer  intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found methylated state while CpG islands are are methylated. Concequences of methylation is associated with its location in genome. For instance, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can result in genomic instability because of the several reasons such as transpositon events, distruption of neighbouring genes, incorrect recombination. Furthermore, genomic instability may occur due to hypomethylation of CpG promoters and can result in gene activation. For instance, activation of a specific microRNA can affect tumour suppressor genes and causes cancer. Deletions of DNA methyltransferases can leads to formation of tumour or supression of it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal and paternal alleles consist of imprint control region. Normally, on the paternal allele the imprint region is methylated whereas on the maternal allele it's unmethylated. Due to it's unmethylated on the maternal allele CTCF4 binds to the imprint region so H19 is controled by enhancer and activated whereas Igf2 is scilence which give rise to no gene expression. On the other hand, on the paternal allele because of the imprint region is methylated CTCF4 cannot bind and that case enhancer act on Igf2 which result in activation of Idf2 and scilencing of H19. When loss of imprinting is happened metyhlation pattern is changed. In that case, on the maternal allele permethylation of the imprint control region give rise to activation of Igf2. This means that on both allele Igf2 is active and due to Igf2 is growth promoting it'is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the DNMT inhibitors which are nucleoside analogs. DNMT inhibitors act during cell replication. During replication process, DNMT1 binds to Decitabine irreversibly and copy the methylation pattern to the daughter strand. It is a DNA-demethylating agent. Because of the tumour cells divided fastly it is stated that tumour cells will be affected more than normal cells but normal cells are also affected the drug its concequences are still not known yet. It has been shown that lower dose of Decitabine can be effective as anti-tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is associated with gene expression. DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable and by altering DNA methylation, expression pattern of a gene can be changed,also it can be transfered into daughter cells by the activity of maintanence DNA methyltransferases. It affects DNA repair mechanisms, apoptosis or imprinting. Sensitive period is defined as epigenetic stages of reprograming. Sensitive periods are early development of embryo and primordial stage of development. Alterations or destruction of normal epigenetic development can have effects on embryo. It has been shown that environmental factors can result in epigenetic changes. Moreover, these epigenetic changes may transfered to the next generations. I think that epigenetic drugs should not be used during pregnancy process due to it can effect sensitive period of embryo. </p></div>
