    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of epigenetic marks that play an important role in regulation of gene expression. This epigenetic mark causes the suppression of the genes which are normally not required to be expressed in certain cell types.</p>
<p>DNA methylation can occurs in several sites of the genome. The CpG islands, mostly found at the promoters of the genes, are usually associated with the alteration of DNA methylation. Generally, CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation in order to allow the expression of some specific genes to maintain normal functions of the body.</p>
<p>CpG islands in cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated – that is being methylated more than that they are supposed to be. This alteration of DNA methylation then causes silencing of the underlying genes, particularly tumor suppressor genes, and finally leads cells containing abnormal epigenetic marks to present cancer phenotypes. CpG islands methylations are increasing with age and able to pass on these epigenetic abnormalities to the daughter cells. They are varying by tumor cell types.</p>
<p>In addition, DNA methylation can occur at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These sites of genes are normally methylated in order to maintain genomic stability, such as to protect the genome from transposable elements, to avoid transcriptional interference and to prevent illegitimate recombination during meiosis.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation, that is decreased level of methylation, at intergenic regions and repetitive elements could be detected in genome of cancer cells. This epigenetic disruption results in genomic instability; for example, illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes, and eventually contributes to cancer formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation, either hypo or hypermethylation, at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) of genes can result in abnormal gene expressions and contribute to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>The regulation of <em>Igf2</em> expression is worth to be considered as a model. In normal cells, the expression of <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster is controlled by genomic imprinting which is different between paternal and maternal alleles. On paternal allele, the <em>H19/Igf2 </em>ICR is methylated preventing CTCF binding and facilitating the methylation at <em>H19</em> promoter. This interaction allows the downstream enhancer to engage with <em>Igf2</em>, rather than <em>H19</em>, and mediates expression of paternal <em>Igf2</em> while blocks the expression of paternal <em>H19</em>. The maternal <em>H19/Igf2 </em>ICR, in contrast, remains unmethylated allowing CTCF binding and letting the enhancer to access H19 that hence mediates expression of maternal H19 instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation at the ICR of <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster, especially on maternal allele, is defined in Wilm’s Tumor. The DNA methylations of both paternal and maternal <em>H19/Ig2</em> ICRs give rise to <em>Igf2</em> overexpression. Since<em> Igf2</em> is responsible for growth promotion as an oncogene, the upregulation of <em>Igf2</em> will eventually cause tumorigenesis by enhancing cells to developed uncontrollable growth and cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Following the fact that epigenetic alteration is reversible in certain conditions; therefore, several drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators are determined to be benefit in treatment of specific cancers.</p>
<p>Decitabine is categorized as DNMT inhibitor, or DNA-demethylating agent, which irreversibly interacts with DNA Methyltransferases (DNMTs) and ultimately inhibits DNA methylation in subsequent rounds of DNA synthesis in cell replication. As Decitabine is replication-dependent so that the more rapidly cancer cells replicate, the more severely they are affected by Decitabine.</p>
<p>Decitabine can suppress tumorigenesis by inhibiting DNA methylation in specific types of cancer. Cancers driven primarily by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, e.g. myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), will get benefits from depletion of DNA methylation so as to recover normal epigenetic state. However, if cancers are driven mostly by hypomethylation and genomic instability, Decetabine appears to result in adversative effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects lasting beyond therapeutic period because cells are able to sustain and forward altering DNA methylation through cell division to daughter cells and subsequent generation.</p>
<p>This mitotic heritability of DNA methylation needs to be carefully considered when giving some drugs that alter DNA methylation to patients. While epigenetic therapy appears to be theoretically beneficial in clinical treatment, the lack of its specificity can cause undesirable effects on normal somatic cells and developing germ cells particularly in young patients.</p>
<p>The period that the alterations in environments have the greatest effect on genetic control is known as sensitive period, which covers the periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development in mammal. During this period, the epigenetic marks are actively remodeled and commonly susceptible to the disruption of epigenetic modification triggered by various causes including drugs given as an epigenetic therapy.</p>
<p>If drugs are given in sensitive period particularly in young patients with developing germ cells in their gonads, the altering epigenetic modification will affect their germ cells and transmit to subsequent cell lineages. In that case, treating patients during sensitive period should be avoided.</p></div>
