    <h1>Submission 1770 from Anon (session_user_id: 0459cce152d0c569cb803bb48dee44936fa07026)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-98c1b015304c216bd04731d7/970238/asst-5/970238-5212b8a7066ed8.71834983.png" alt="" /><br />Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is a citidine deoxinucleosyde analogue which belongs to DNA methyltranferases inhibitors class. It inhibits, (low dosis) DNA methyltransferases in a selective way.In fact, as a consequence of Decitabine action, gene promoters are hypomethylated and it can cause the reactivation of supressor genes, induction of cell differentiation and programmed cell death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine as a epigenetic inhibitor (DNA methyl-tranferase inhibitor) can play an important role in cancer treatment reactivating the expression of some key genes silenced in tumoural cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have inportant consequencies for the offspring depending on the moment when it happens, because these changes can be heritable. So scientists, should take into account this information before treating patients with drugs which alter the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the time, during development of a certain organism, when the environment influence on epigenetic control can cause changes on the epigenome which are mitotically heritable. This concept is related to trangenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks through gametes. During sensitive periods the epigenome is ore sensitive to environmental effects.</p>
<p>During development, we identify two important periods when there is epigenetic reprograming or active remodelling of the epigenome. One is primordial germ cell development and the other is pre-implantation and post-implantation period. These periods are known as sensitive periods.</p>
<p>We should avoid treating patients during these sensitive period because the consequences are uncontrolled and modifying the epigenome which is going to be transgenerational inherited could have negative consequences for the patient's offspring.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First of all, the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the expression of genes regulated by this promoter which contains the CpG islands. In normal cells, CpG islands usually are hypomethylated, but in cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. Actually, this process contributes directly to disease, because CpG islands hypermethylation silences tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>"The more CpG islands methylation the more aggresive the tumour is "</p>
<p> Secondly, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells usually are hypermethylated, by contrast in cancer cells these elements are hypomethylated what is called "Genome wide hypomethylation" The consequences of this process are:</p>
<p>-Genomic instability by illegitimate recombination</p>
<p>-Activation of repeats and transposition by activation of cryptic promoters or disrupting neighbouring genes</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters causes the activation of silenced genes, which once are activated can cause cancer or disease, for instance activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally DNA methylation is one of the process which is clearly altered in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, a good example to explain it is : the cluster gene H19/Igf2 whose disruption is involved in Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 are reciprocally imprinted (silenced in one of the parental alleles)</p>
<div>Two regulatory regions are important for their parental allele-specific expression: a differentially methylated region (DMR) also known as a ICR, upstream of H19 and a set of tissue specific enhancers downstream of H19.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The intereactions between the enhancers and the genes are regulated by the DMR.</div>
<p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-98c1b015304c216bd04731d7/970238/asst-5/970238-5212b7ba785a28.39049980.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<div> </div>
<div>On the paternal chromosome the DMR (ICR) is methylated inactivating adjacent H19, and the enhancers act allowing Igf2 expression. By contrast, an un methylated DMR (ICR) on the maternal chromosome insulates Igf2 from enhancers, allowing H19 expression.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Wilm's tumour, two principal somatic abnormalities occur at 11p15: paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD-11p15) and H19 epimutation, also known as Igf2 loss of imprinting. These defects result in H19 hypermethylation and biallelic Igf2 expression what contributes to development of Wilm's tumour.</div>
