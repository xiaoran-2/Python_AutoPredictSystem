    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands areas of DNA containing many Cytosine and Guanine nucleotides, with a phosphodiester bond linking them. CpG methylation is used to silence genes, when this silencing occurs at the CpG islands (or their "shores") associated with tumour suppressor genes, then they can be silenced and so are unable to suppress abnormal cell replication. Removing the tumour suppressor's ability to cease cell replication in the case of the cell machinery detecting defects. This means that the epigenetic mutation functions as one of the "hits" required for cancer. Another mutation is required for the cell to start replicating uncontrollably, but when this does happen, the silenced tumour suppressor cannot block the cell cycle.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation (rather than hypermethylation) at intergencic regions or repetitive elements leads to a number of different erroneous cell behaviours. Firstly, the hypomethylation allows repeated elements to act as loci for recombination at sites where this leads to malfunction. Normally methylation blocks this. Similarly, the lack of methylation leads to the repeats becoming active, when they are normally silenced. In cancer, the usual silencing being absent can lead to the repeats/intergenic regions acting as promoters for the neighbouring genes. </p>
<p>Excessive activity of these neighbouring genes, or malfunction of genes due to inappropriate translocation/recombination can lead to deregulate cell behaviour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine binds to DNMT and leads to a reduction in methylation. At a correct dose, the reduction in methylation affects neoplasms more than somatic cells, leading to an anti-tumour effect. The anti-neoplastic effect may work by inhibiting the methylation (and maintenance thereof) of tumour suppressor genes. This has the effect of removing erroneous silencing of these genes, leading to more expression and hence an increase in anti-neoplastic cell activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a persistant state for the DNA, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) is used by the cell to maintain the current methylation status so the actions of the drugs will persist beyond the duration of the medication. This process of DNA methylation maintenance is used by the body to preserve the effects of methylation after it has been established. Maintenance is not absolute (or there would be no epigenetic mutations) but the process is required to keep methylation mitotically stable once it is established after sensitive periods.<br /><br />Sensitive periods are times when the methylation status is prone to change. This occurs during gametogenesis and embryogenesis, and are periods of dynamic changes of methylation. These are also periods when the epigenetic profile is vulnerable to environmental interference. As a result, the use of this type of drug would potentially alter the methylation status of the developing epigenome which would then persist, and may be pathological. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprinting centre associated with the H19 locus is methylated, leading to silencing of the paternal H19. This in turn leads to a lack of Igf2 silencing, so Igf2 is expressed freely. <br /><br />On the maternal allele, the imprinting centre associated with the H19 locus is UNmethylated, leading to no silencing of the H19. The H19 is therefore expressed and silences the Igf2 gene. Therefore, in the normal maternal allele, there is no Igf2 expression. In the healthy somatic cell this imprinted silencing is used to ensure the correct dose of Igf2 is expressed.<br /><br />In a Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele takes the epigenetic status of the paternal allele, with erroneous methylation and hence silencing of the H19 gene. This leads to a lack of Igf2 suppression in either allele, so twice as much Igf2 is produced as it should be. This leads to pathological cell behaviour, as the Igf2 expression is pro-growth, and therefore an excess of its expression is associated with neoplasia.</p></div>
