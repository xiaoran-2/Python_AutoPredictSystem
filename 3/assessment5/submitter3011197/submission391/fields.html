    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome provides a regulatory system that influences when and to what degree genes are expressed. CpG islands are often found in the genome upstream of genes, methylation of CpG islands tends to prevent the expression of the downstream gene. In the normal genome, while some CpG islands are methylated, most are not. In contrast in cancers, CpG islands are progressively methylated, which means that their downstream genes can be switched off. This may result in the switching off of a cancer supresser gene allowing the development of a cancer.</p>
<p>In normal tissue, repetive elements and CpGs present in intergenic regions tend to be methlylated, this promotes the formation of densely packaged heterochromatin and genomic stability. In cancer, these methylation marks are progressively lost. This results in the DNA becoming less densely packaged and in genomic instability whereby some genes may be deleted, some genes being present in multiple copies and in some genes swapping positions between two different chromosomes. This genetic degeneration can result in the promotion of normally silent genes promoting cancer growth and/ or spread. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One particular disruption that often occurs in cancer cells is the disruption of imprinted genes. For imprinted genes, although two copies are present, one from each parent, only one is expressed.</p>
<p>For the Igf2 gene, which is a growth promoter, the CpG island on the maternal allele is normally unmethylated whereas on the paternal allele the CpG island is methylated. A CTCF proteinis thus able to bind to ICR on the maternal allele blocking downstream enhancers from acting on the Igf2 gene. On the paternal, methylated allele the CTCF protein cannot bind to the ICR and cannot block the enhancers acting on the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour patients the imprinting goes wrong, either because two copies of the paternal allele are inherited, or by mutation or by errors in the epigenetic methylation pattern, and both alleles present express the growth promoting Igf2 gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA - demethylating agent. <span style="font-size:14px;">Decitabine acts to remove methyl marks, eg those at CpG islands from the genome.</span></p>
<p>Where, in a cancer CpG islands have been methylated so supressing tumour supressor genes, using decitabine could reverse this process, allowing the tumour supress gene to be reactivated, thus checking the tumours progress.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks are stable and mitotically heritable. So if a drug alters the methylation state, the altered state will be both maintained in the treated cell and inherited by daughter cells. Sensitive periods are periods when epigentic reprogramming is occuring. These occur in the oocytes of pre-teenage girls, and in embryonic development; so treating pregnant women would be inadvisable, this is because during these sensitive periods the drug might well interfere with both imprinting processes and other epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
