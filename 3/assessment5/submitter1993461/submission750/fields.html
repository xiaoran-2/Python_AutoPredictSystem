    <h1>Submission 750 from Anon (session_user_id: 596ebc54e42b31a91461669885293395df3286d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and acts as a DNA demethylating agent.  This means that it contributes to a decrease in DNA methylation. Decitabine binds to the enzyme DNMT, inhibiting its function of methylating cytosines of DNA, particularly genes that control cell proliferation (tumor suppressor genes?).  Normally, DNMT methylates DNA, bringing about its silencing.  If a tumor suppressor gene is silenced, then the cell proliferates without control.  However, when decitabine is used,  tumor suppressor  genes are NOT methylated, and they can be expressed, cell proliferation is controlled, and cancerous cells do not reproduce as they should.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal pattern of DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer cells.  In general, we could say that the methylation pattern in a normal cell is opposite to the methylation pattern in a cancer cell.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands found in the promoter region of genes are usually unmethylated, permitting the expression of the gene</p>
<p>In cancer, promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated, causing the silencing of the gene.  When this silenced gene is a tumor suppresor gene, negative consequences result, since those genes are in charge of controlling the cell cycle, command apoptosis of the cancer cell, or order the repair of mistakes in DNA</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG regions found in  intergenic zones and in repetitive elements are usually methylated, but in cancer these same regions are unmethylated.</p>
<p>Methylated CpG  regions in intergenic and in repetitive elements contribute to chromosome stability.  When these regions are unmethylated, chromosomes become destabilized, bringing about "genomic instability (activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, disruption of genes)" (Blewitt, 2013) and chromosome aberrations (deletions, translocations, insertions) that are commonly associated with cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can break a delicate balance in the cell, bringing about problems like cancer.  This is well illustrated in the H19/Ifg2 gene cluster.  In a normal cell, the maternal ICR is hypomethylated whereas the paternal ICR is hypermethylated.  Hypomethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele lets CTFC bind to it.  CTCF acts as an insulator, preventing the downstream enhancers to act on IGf2, a growth promoting gene.  The enhancers act instead on the H19 gene, which is expressed.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICR in the paternal allele does not allow the binding of CTCF, thus avoiding the insulator effect on Igf2.  Besides, the hypermethylation extends to the H19 region suppressing its expression.  The net effect is that the enhancers promote the expression of Igf2, bringing about cell growth.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor, both the paternal and the maternal alleles are hypermethylated, so the enhancers act in both of the Igf2 alleles, causing a "double-dose" signal for growth.  This can produce an uncontrolled growth of the cell, giving rise to a tumor.  The delicate balance established between the maternal and the paternal Igf2 alleles has been broken.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can be used along with other drugs to combat cancer cells.  One advantage of using those epigenetic drugs is that--besides favoring the expression of tumor supressor genes-- they can "alter" the genome in a lasting way.  This is because those drugs provoke epigenetic changes, and epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable; they can pass from one cell generation to the next.</p>
<p>  This apparent advantage should be carefully assessed, since there are periods in development that are particularly sensitive to the use of a drug that alters the epigenetic marks.  Those "sensitive periods" are periods of development during which epigenetic marks (such as DNA methylation) are erased and re-established.  They are periods of epigenetic reprogramming and occur in the  early days of  development, during primordial germ cell development, and during germ cell development (pre-puberty).</p>
<p>Any change in the methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation in these sensitive periods, can provoke relevant changes in the epigenetic marks, causing an activation or supresssion of certain genes, disrupting their normal function.  This is why the use of  epigenetic drugs in these periods is not advisable. </p></div>
