    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are found in about 60% of promotors, they have a higth CpG density and its activity depends of the methylation state, however in cancer the promotors of the CpG islands tend to become hypermtethylated. In this context the DNA  hypermethyation of CpG islads in cancer can causes silencing of genes necessaries to cellular control.The alterations in DNA methylation causes disruption in protonogenes and supressor genes that controlling cell cycle. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is very important in sequences satellits and insertiosn such as LINEs and SINEs. It cans cause genomic instability such as recombination between repeats, activation of the repetitions and transposition, caused disruption to neighbouring genes. in the normal cell the methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements help to kept the genomic instability. A desvalanced in the epigenetic as hypomethylatio can lead to deletions of the DNMT1 with the evidence of many cancers</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the methylation pattern </span> paternal the allele  <em>Igf2</em>  is specifically methylated in two locations <span>within the gene itself and in its 5′ flank, with <span>this correlation of  methylation and expression of </span><em>Igf2 </em><span>extends to the choroid plexus, a tissue that expresses both alleles of</span><em>Igf2</em><span> and exhibits biallelic methylation. this selft <span>status  is inconsistent with other model that proposed silencing function of the maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele<span>. For the </span><span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span><span> gene, however, the copy that is inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body. This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. </span>In the Wilmés tumor the<span> biallelic expression of </span><em>IGF2</em><span> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in </span><em>IGF2.</em><span> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele presumably with a role in repression. <span>Genetic evidence shows that the parent of origin-dependent expression patterns of the</span><em>Igf2</em><span> and </span><em>H19</em><span> genes is coordinated in mouse,  </span><em>H19</em><span> controls the activity of </span><em>Igf2</em><span> in </span><em>cis, here there is a</em><span> frequently observed in the activation of the maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele  with  </span><span>loss of imprinting in Wilms' tumors, it has been attributed to the silencing of the maternal </span><em>H19</em><span> locus.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a <span>combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine, it is important, because the combination showed a <span>unexpectedly good </span>reation <span> chemotherapeutic <span>against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma. many of this medicaments can</span></span></span> inhibit an epigenetic regulator  or blocks the activity of a gene with relation to the cancer. Decitabine causes <span>epigenetic changes wiche are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration DNA methylation can have many effects on the epigenome, there are sensitive periods than are necessary avaluate them in the context of the chemotherapy, a sensitive period can be define as a moment sensivel to alterations or mutations that can caused risk for the health or the genome. It sensitive period can be in the moment of the pre implantation and during of embronary development when the ephygenetic marks are beging to be stabeleced. Of the treating during this sensitive period would be of many risk because the epigenetic is stablished and defined the models the epigenetic necessaries to funtionally normal of the cells and the organism.</p></div>
