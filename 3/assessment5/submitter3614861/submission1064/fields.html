    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammalian development, epigenetic modifications such as cytosine methylation in the CpG-rich regions regulate multiple functions.  These effects include the recruitment of methyl binding proteins and chromatin remodeling, transcriptional repression, X chromosome inactivation and imprinting.  Genomic DNA undergoes extensive reprogramming during carcinogenesis and changes in DNA methylation are frequent event in cancers.  Relative to normal tissue the genome derived from cancer cells  shown to exhibit both global and locus-specfic hypo or hypermethylation in the CpG island of large number different genes  including those involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, tumor suppressor and those inovolved  in genome defense pathways.</p>
<p> In general mechanistically, repetitive element with the help of retrotransposon or transposon can make copy of themselves, jump out and paste or insert somewhere else in the genome which may results a mutagenic outcome and disrupts proper function of other gene.  In normal cells, hypermethylation in repetitive element prevent such transposition of the repetitive element and avoid transcriptional interference or illegitimate recombination.   In addition, hypermethylation in intergenic regions maintain genomic stability, integrity and normal karyotype.  However, in cancer aberrant DNA methylation or failure to maintain methylation (hypomethylation) in the intergenic region or repetitive elements results abnormal karyotypes.  Such changes occur due to genomic instability of the intergenic regions and may results in deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions or duplication of the whole chromosome. Interestingly the CpG island of promoters of normal cells in general are hypomethylated, in contrast the promoter regions of cancer cells are more likely to-be hypermethylated. However, hypermethylation of CpG island in the promoter of tumor suppressor and hypomethylation in oncogene can results cancers. Thus DNA methylation play a pivotal role in normal cell and aberrant methylation can modulate the epigenome resulting cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, methylation in the imprinting control regions (ICR) fine tuned the expression of many genes.  For example, ICR in <em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2</em> cluster varies in methylation pattern depending on parental origin.  In paternal allele the ICR is methylated and block the binding of insulator protein CTCF and thus the downstream enhancers gets free access to Igf2 and enhance the expression. Simultaneously it spreads the methylation to <em>H19</em> promoter and silences its expression<em> </em>(paternally imprinted).  In contrast, ICR  (<em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2 </em>cluster) in maternal allele is unmethylated and  CTCF insulator protein can bind to ICR and insulate  <em>Igf2</em> , thus the down-stream enhancer have free access to <em>H19</em> and enhance<em> </em> expressions.  However in the cancer cell one of the common features is loss of imprinting i.e. it either expressed or silence from both the parental allele.  It may occur either due to hyper or hypomethylation of imprint regions.  For example, in <em>H19</em>/ <em>Igf2</em> cluster, if hypermethylation occur in ICR of maternal allele there will be loss of imprinting and <em>Igf2 </em>from maternal allele will express resulting double dose of Igf2 expression from both the allele.  Such over-expression of Igf2 will promote over growth resulting cancer or Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an analog of deoxycytidine and it gets activated by photophosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase and it is mainly DNA demethylating agent i.e  it belong to epigenetic class of DNA methyl transferase inhbitor.   Mechanistically it’s a nucleoside analog and its  antineoplastic action depends on its incorporation into DNA upon replication and forming covalent complex at active site of DNA methyltransferase1 and inhibiting its activity by binding  irreversibly resulting demethylating or hypomethylation.  In cancer, where cytogenetic changes took place due to aberrant DNA methylation resulting silencing of genes ( eg. Growth related genes, which suppress malignancy), decitabine can reactivate those genes by modulating the methylation pattern.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drug can stop a cancer cell to proliferate without killing all its cells by altering DNA methylation.  It can have enduring effects on the epigenome because in-contrast to the other form of gene regulations the epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) are very stable mark and mitotically heritable which is passed on to subsequent cell generations during cell divisions until they are actively erased irreversibly.</p>
<p>Sensitive period are the stages in development when a global epigenetic reprogramming takes place and in which the genome of developing embryo has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences.  The two reprogramming windows i.e primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development are most sensitive period for epigenetic reprogramming.  It is advisable to avoid treating patients with such drugs during this period as it may have adverse effect on the health outcome of the patient and will effect to the devloping fetus having transgenerational outcome.  Treating with such drug during this sensitive period may alter the environment, disrupt, speed up or avoid entirely any of the processes that play role in the epigenetic reprogramming event.  </p></div>
