    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG island silences the expression of the genes. However, in normal cell CpG island is mostly unmethylated (i.e CpG island is hypomethylated). In case of cancer cell, there is a high possibility of CpG  island being methylated (i.e CpG island is hypermethylation) and this causes silencing of genes. CpG islands are often found at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and the methylation of the CpG island in the cancer cells inactivate or silences the tumor suppressor genes. When tumor suppressor genes are inactivated, tumor cells grow rapidly and can contribute to tumorgenesis. Similarly,  intergenic region and repetitive elements are heavily methylated (hypermethylated) in normal cells. This helps in maintaining the genomic integrity of cells i.e. silencing of repeats to prevent transposition of repeats or to avoid transcriptional interference from promoters and also to prevent illegitimate recombination.  However in cancer cells, intergenic and repetitive regions are hypomethylated which leads to genomic instability. In cancer cells, illegitimate recombination occurs between repeats firstly because  the repeats region are unmethylated  and also because the DNA is open and recombination can easily occurs between them. These recombination can cause deletion, insertion or translocation. Similarly, activation of repeats occurs. Repeats can also jump from one chromosome to next disrupting the coding regions of genes and also activating the neighboring genes.  These genomic instability is one of the hallmark of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control region (ICR) of paternal allele is methylated.  Thus, CTCF which is insulator protein does not bind to methylated ICR. Thus, Igf2 is not insulated so enhancers bind to Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed. H19 is not active as methylated ICR is spread and methylated H19 as well and is silenced due to CpG promoter. ICR of maternal allele is unmethylated and CTCF binds to this unmethylated ICR. This insulates Igf2 from enhancers.  Instead, enhancers acts on H19 and H19 is expressed.  Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation can be found in ICR region that causes loss of imprinting. However, in case of Wilm’s tumor hypermethylation of ICR region was found. Due to hypermethylation, maternal  ICR is also methylated along with parental ICR and CTCF doesnot bind to methylated ICR. Thus, enhancers bind to Igf2 and ifg2 is expressed ib both paternal and maternal allele. Also, as ICR is methylated is also methylated H19. Now, in case of Wilm’s tumor, both paternal and maternal igf2 is expressed, this leads to overexpression of igf2 in Wilm’s tumor.  Igf2 is growth promoting genes and overexpression of this gene promotes cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme which causes DNA methylation of unmethylated DNA.  Decitabine inhibits DNMT1. DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation during cell division.  DNMT1 identifies hemi methylated DNA (i.e one strand is methylated and other is unmethylated) and binds to it and methylate unmethylated daughter strands.  Thus, Decitabine inhibits DNMT1 and the daughter cell is not methylated. Decitabine is incorporated in DNA and DNMT1 binds to it permanently and cannot be released. As Decitabine gets incorporated in the DNA, so the effect of Decitabine exist through all cell divisions and daughter cells will not be methylated. In cancer cells, the Decitabine have more effects as the cancer cells replicated more.  So,  Decitabine is useful drugs when cancer is caused by hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable i.e the methylation is passed to daughter cells and to granddaughter cells during cell division. Thus, if the DNA methylation is altered in parent cells, they can be passed on upon every replication of the cells and even though the effects of altering DNA methylation are not visible immediately, but these changes can be passed on to other generation and can be visible later on. In the cells, epigenetics marks are first recognized and then marked in the germ cells and later maintained. Sensitive period is the time when these epigenetics marks are still being marked in the germ cells. In drugs treatment, we should be careful while treating young patients as their germ cells are still developing. The drugs used for treating patients also have their side effects and their side effects are not totally understood. Thus, if we treat patients during sensitive periods, these drugs which will be incorporated in their DNA and can be passed on to other generation. These side effects can then be passed on to their children and also to grandchildren. So, the generation to come can be effected.  </p></div>
