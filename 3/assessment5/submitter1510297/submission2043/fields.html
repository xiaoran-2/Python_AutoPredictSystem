    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, but the genome in general is methylated at intergenic regions and repetative elements. Generally in a Cancer cell CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the intergenic regions and repetative elements are hypomethylated. Most CpG islands are found in the promotor of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation can cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes, and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this is a good locking- down mechanism. Allowing for the silencing of tumor suppressor genes given the cancer cells a competative advantage, and their constant replicating will allow them to eventuate.In cancer cells, repetative elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The lack of methylation causes the genes to not be as tightly packaged down which allows for illigitimate recombination between repeats and activation of repeats and transposition. This may also cause activation of cryptic promotors and disruptions to neighboring genes. These can lead to additions, deletions and reciprocal translocations on the allele.  Basically overall genomic instabiility. Cells that have these epimutations can divide more rapidly allowing cancer to take over.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Their are many imprinted genes involved in growth, whether it be promoting or suppressing growth. These gens can have either hypomethylation or hypermethylation depending on the imprint control region you are looking at and the function of the genes within that specific control region. With reguards to the H19/Igf2 cluster, in a normal cell you see a methylated ICR on the paternal allele which allows enhancers to act on Igf2. In the maternal allele CTCF insulates the unmethylated ICR allowing for enhancers to act on H19 and the silencing of Igf2. A loss of imprinting will cause hypermethylation of the ICR of both alleles, which in turn will lead to Igf2 expression on the maternal and paternal allele. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, the loss of imprinting leads to an overexpression of the growth promoting factors and loss of tumor suppressor genes, which is illustrated in young children with Wilm's tumor. If you now have a double dose of growth promoting factors and a loss of tumor suppressing factors, you are facilitating tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. As a nucleoside analogue it can be incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, DNMT1 is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. This will cause overall global DNA hypomethylation, allowing for genomic instability. DNTM inhibitors like Decitabine have been found toxic when given at high doses, but at lower doses may cause re-activity of genes that stop cancer growth without causing immediate cell killing or DNA damage. Since DNMTi are division dependent, the rapidly dividing cancer cells are an ideal target for Decitabine. Since it may hit all dividing cells to some extent, long term effects are still unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation include hypomethylation genome wide but hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The causes genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes-controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair-by hypermethylation of their promotor CpG islands. When administering DNMT inhibitors, all dividing cells are being somewhat effected, not just cancer cells. The sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming when you have clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Their are periods of epigenetic reprogramming when you have a decrease in DNA methylation: during pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development.  During primordial germ cell development pluripotency is most likely maintained by epigentic means. Therapeutic drug intenvention with DNMTi may cause methylation or demethylation of undesired genes during this sensative developmental time, as well as facilitating a possible error in spermatogenesis and oogenesis that can be further perpetuated over time.</p></div>
