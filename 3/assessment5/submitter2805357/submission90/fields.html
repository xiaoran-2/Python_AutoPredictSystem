    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a single methyl group to cytosine at position 5. In normal cells, this modification is established on cytosines preceding guanine (CpG islands) in DNA sequence of gene promoters and it causes the silencing of gene expression through the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. About half of human gene promoters have unmethylated CpG islands to maintain active the expression of downstream genes. In cancer, it is observed a locus specific DNA hypermethylation on CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes that causes their permanent silencing. Epigenetic silencing of these genes, critical for control of cellular proliferation (e.g. cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes, apoptosis mediators, transcription factors and cell adhesion molecules), concurs to the development of malignant phenotype. This alternative mechanism of inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is more frequent than genetic mutation and it is recurring in several tumour types because DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable and rapidly selected. The DNA methylation can be used as biomarkers in several fields: in diagnosis, to identify tumour type and subtype; in prognosis, because hypermethylation could increase with tumorigenesis; in treatment, to choose the best therapy and monitor tumour decline and recurrence.DNA methylation is found normally in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity. It is important for silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic spice sites, for prevention of transposition and illegitimate recombination. In most cancer cells, there is a decrease of total amount of methylated cytosine in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This genome-wide hypomethylation is responsible for a general genomic instability due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. All these events lead to chromosomal reciprocal translocation, delections and insertion, tipical features of malignant cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, imprinted genes, normally expressed by paternal or maternal allele, could be expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. In particular, hypermethylation and hypomethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) cause a loss of expression of growth restricting genes or an overexpression of growth promoting genes, contributing to the malignant phenotype. A typical example of this loss of imprinting is the overexpression of IGF2 in Wilm’s tumour. In normal cells, the ICR of the region is unmethylated on the maternal allele: this allows the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, that insulates IGF2 from downstream enhancers, permitting the expression of H19 gene. In paternal allele, the ICR region is methylated and this do not permit the CTCF binding. The downstream enhancers are so free to bind the IGF2 promoter that is expressed. Wilm’s tumour is characterized by the hypermethylation of ICR region on maternal and paternal alleles. Therefore enhancers can bind the IGF2 promoter in both alleles and this permits the expression of IGF2 in double dose. The overexpression of IGF2 promotes tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Targeting epigenetic machinery is becoming a very active area of research since many epi-mutations were identified in several cancer types during recent years. For example, alteration in DNA methylation could have different effects on the epigenome: it can be observed not only a tumour suppressor hypermethylation but also a genome-wide hypomethylation. Different tumours have different dependencies and so they must be treated in different ways. Moreover, an important note of caution is the use of these drugs during sensitive periods of development, when the epigenetic modifications are established. In particular, two sensitive periods are identified: the early embryonic preimplantation period and the primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Therefore, the administration of these drugs in young patients or in pregnant women could have potentially serious side effects, for their ability to interfere with epigenetic machinery during PGCs development or during fetus growth.      </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It was recently introduced a new class of drugs for the treatment of cancer, consisting in small molecule inhibitors targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators. An example is Decitabine that belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMTs after incorporation into DNA. Therefore it is replication-dependent and cancer cells will be more severely affected by this drug for their propensity to replicate continually. It is characterized by lack of specificity inherent to the mechanism of action (not completely clear). Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplasic syndrome and other haematological malignancies for their dependence on CpG island hypermethylation: in fact with the used of this drug it possible to block the DNMTs and so the methylation of several DNA regions. Moreover, several trials are underway for the use of the drug in other tumours, expecially solid tumours.    </p></div>
