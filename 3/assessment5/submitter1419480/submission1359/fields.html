    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer cells represents a kind of paradoxical distribution in contrast to the usual DNA methylation in benign cells.  Overall in the case of cancers cells there is a marked reduction of methylation throughout the genome.  The opposite occurs in the normally hypomethylated CpG islands.  In the normal cell, CpG islands are segregated areas near the center of the nucleus that represent factories for DNA transcription.  These are sites of promoters and enzymes that promote the transcription process.  They are normally protected from the type of methylation that would limit transcription.  In cancer cells they become increasingly methylated.  The result is a reduction in the transcription of genes that regulate cell replication, apoptosis and differentiation.  With these cellular controls inactivated, the cell is freed to proliferated beyond normal limits, dedifferentiate and become immortalized, leading to neoplasia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation normally occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  The repetitive elements include such structures as satellite repeats and sites where retroviral insertions are thought to have occurred.  This high concentration of methylation prevents expression and stabilizes the chromatin strand. They are compact and quiescent. As mentioned above, there is a generalized loss of methylation in the genome of cancer cells.  Of particular importance is the loss of methylation of these sites in malignant cells results in loss of suppression of these normally silent areas.  Karyotypic instability, heterochromatin-euchromatin interaction, activation of tumor promoting genes and tumor progression are the result.  This can lead to increased chances of rearrangement of these segments within a chromosome or translocation to other chromosomes with formation of fusion genes (e.g BCR/ABL) that may become autonomous   promoters of cell proliferation.  Hypomethylation may be at the heart of the increased adaptability that cancers cells demonstrate that make them refractory to control.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene complex  represents an example of  imprinting on somatic chromosomes.  .  In mammals the materal H 19 gene (coding a long non coding RNA) is expressed while the paternal allele is inactivated.  The adjacent gene for Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal allele, while the maternal allele is inactivated.  The mechanism for imprinting is the differential methylation of the alleles and adjacent loci.  In the maternal strand, CTCF binds to the ICR upstream from the H19 locus. </p>
<p>Expression of maternal H19 forms a lncRNA than maintains CTCF binding and blocks upstream cis expression of Igf2.  Downstream enhancers provide  positive feedback  to H19 but not Igf2.  On the  paternal chromosome, the H19 allele is heavily methylated as is the ICR.  The downstream enhancers stimulate expression of Igf2 .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilms tumor, there is loss of the maternal H19 and bi-allelic expression of the paternal Igf2 or possibly hypermethylation of the maternal H19 leading to inactivation of the imprinting controls over IgF2. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In other tumors such as bladder and breast cancer, the H19 allele appears upregulated producing excess H19 RNA, a marker of aggressive disease by increasing cell proliferation rateand facilitating estrogen receptor stimulus role in breast cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is one of two currently available hypomethylating agents that can be used in the treatment of myelodysblastic syndromes  . In myelodysplasia, hypermethylated genes are inactivated leading to  ineffective hematopoiesis and eventually blast transformation.  Decitabine is the 2-deoxy-5-aza- analog of cytidine.  In optimal doses, it become incorporated into DNA strands at cytidine positions.  DNA methyl transferase I (DNMT I) is icovalently bound to the 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine site on the strand, and is neutralized.   Genes involved in apoptosis, differentiation and normal cell cycle control can then be expressed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MDS is a common hematologic malignancies in older patients, and like other solid tumors, share a common feature of aberrant DNA methylation.  Several hypermethylated genes in MDS, p15<sup>INK4B</sup> codes a cell cycle inhibitor.  Drug induced demethylation allows re-expression of this gene and reduces the release of blastic cells that characterizes the move to acute myelogenous leukemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation target DNMT1 by insertion of  a cytosine analog into  DNA in place of native cytosine.  When DNMT1 attempts to attach to and methylate CpG sites, it is bound to the altered cytosine and inactivated resulting in diminished methylation and regaining of genetic expression of tumor suppressor and cell cycle control genes.  Because the drug isbound to DNA and not metabolized  it produces a lasting demethylation effect beyond the period of drug treatment, through successive cell cycles. The most sensitive periods for drug activity are when new methylation is occurring.  Sensitive periods occur when tumor cells are moving from the stem cell compartment to the differentiation stage and when DNA synthesis is occurring.  This makes such drugs valuable in treating cancers.  There are however other sensitive periods in the life cycle of the organism when treatment can have impact on reproduction including gametogenesis, the blastocyst phase including segregation of primordial germ cells, and at the time of allelic imprinting.  A methylation inhibitor could be lethal to the fetus or render the offspring infertile.  Therefore use of drugs that alter methylation would be inadvisable in women who may be in early pregnancy, and in prepubertal childhood. </p></div>
