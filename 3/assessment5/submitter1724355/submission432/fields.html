    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">DNA methylation at CpG islands is involved in several processes, such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin. However, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, especially at promoter regions, since it silences gene expression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cancer, this ‘protection” is lost, and is common to find hypermethylation of CpG islands at gene promoters, silencing genes than otherwise would be active. The inactivation of tumour suppressor genes is critical, because they are the ones that control the over-growth of abnormal cells. Examples of this kind of genes are BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer and MLH1 in colorectal cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it is usual to find intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome methylated, as a mechanism to maintain genome stability (this is avoiding deletions, insertions and translocations). Less frequently, the methylation of intergenic regions can silence transcription from cryptic promoters or silence cryptic splice sites. The methylation of repetitive elements can also protect the genome from transposable elements, which could disrupt genes when they move around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In cancer, things are the other way around: it is common to find hypomethylation of repetitive elements and of intergenic regions, both leading to genomic instability. This hypomethylation can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposons and cryptic promoters, which may cause disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a broad way, this epigenetic abnormalities can lead to cancer via inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, whose proteins control over-growth of abnormal cells,  or activation of oncogenes, whose proteins promote the over-grow of such cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">One possible outcome of alterations of DNA methylation is the hyper/hypomethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs), which can cause loss of imprinting, and so, misexpression of growth-regulating or growth-promoting genes, both with potential carcinogenic effect. For example, hypermethylation of ICR at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes overexpression of Igf2 in Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster at chromosome 11 shows imprinting expression:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;"><li>The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, and this prevents the binding of CTCF to the ICR. Plus, the methylation spreads to H19, and so enhancers can’t act on it. As a result, enhancers promote the expression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene.</li>
<li>The maternal allele does not display methylation at the ICR, and CTCF protein can bind to it, blocking the enhancers’ activity on Igf2. This leads to expression of H19, a growth-suppressing gene.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify;"> Hypermethylation of ICR at H19/Igf2 cluster leads to over-expression of Igf2 (the maternal allele behaves like a paternal one). As said before, Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, also known as oncogene, and so can cause the excessive growth of cells (or tumors) found in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug with enzymatic function, which acts as a DNA-demethylation agent, i.e it is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that incorporates to the DNA during replication and then binds irreversibly to DNMT1, preventing the extent of DNA methylation to the daughter strand after replication. Because cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, they are more severely affected by the drug.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being stated that various tumours show hypermethylation at CpG islands, CpG shores and/or ICRs, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by avoiding this hypermethylation, and thus preventing the over-expression of oncogenes and/or the down-regulation of tumour suppressor genes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Since DNAmethylation is mitotically inheritable, methylation status of DNA will be passed to daughter and granddaughter cells, no matter if it is a normal, hypo or hypermethylated state. So, when using drugs that alter the DNAmethylation pattern, changes will pass to the next generations of cell until ‘fixed’ or until the drug is removed: if a drug has a demethylation effect, DNAmethylation will decreased with each generation until erased. But it is very important to consider that epigenetic drugs are not specific, and so they affect both cancer and normal cells.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving these drugs to patients in sensitive periods would be inadvisable. These is defined as a period in which altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. For mammals, they are two major sensitive periods: from primordial germ cells to production of mature gametes, and during preimplantation and early postimplantation. Sensitive periods in humans are the earliest pregnancy and the reproductive age, when gametes are being either produced or maturated. Because of remodeling of epigenetic marks during these periods, drugs would have a major effect in epigenetic regulation, and this could extent all through the organism or to its descendants, causing inviability of embryo or diseases of various severity.</p></div>
