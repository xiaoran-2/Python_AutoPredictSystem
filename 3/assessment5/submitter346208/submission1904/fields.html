    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGF2 gene promotes growth of each individual cell and organism as a whole. Sex-specific imprinting is thought to stem from “parental conflict” when male tries to make fittest offspring in expense of mother’s resources. Mother in turn tries to create energy-saving epigenetic profile for the offspring. Therefore maternal H19/Igf2 cluster has unmethylated ICR which forces enhancers found in H19/Igf2 cluster to act on growth-restricting H19 gene and not on IGF2 gene. It happens due to binding of an CTCF to the unmethylated ("open") ICR. While on paternal chromosome the opposite takes place: ICR is methylated, methylation spreads to H19 promoter CpG islands and therefore H19 is silenced and cluster enhancers act on IGF2 gene for there is no more suitable targets left.</p>
<p>Should H19-trancription mediated mono-allelic IGF2 silencing be lost due to H19 or the ICR mutation, upstream Kcnq1 cluster disruption, or complete absence of maternal chromosome (two paternal chromosomes), excessive amount of growth-promoting (and therefore potentially oncogenic) Igf2 will be produced due to translating it from both alleles. This condition is called Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and characterized by general overgrowth, macroglossia, acromegalia and early-onset child cancers (Wilm`s tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decatabine specifically disrupts DNA methyltransferases. It is purported to prevent numerous methylation events lied by mutated DNMT (such as EZH2) in several myeloproliferative conditions. This drug-induced methylation inhibition will leave tumor suppressor genes open to expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is inherent feature of epignetic marks that once placed they remain rather stable during the cell`s life and then will be passed to next mitotic generation. But during the period of time when these marks are being lied down anew (i.e. sensitive period) the molecular machinery that does this work is vulnerable to external interference. During embrionic development epigenetic marks are being re-established twice after erasure of the previous marks - at the time of gastrulation and when the primordial germ cells are differentiating. But in cancer cells many prevously existing marks are being rewritten at the time of cancer cell undergoes malignisation. Keeping in mind all the healthy cells are staying refractory to any epigenetic machinery disturbance (all the marks have been placed already) it is possible to use epigenetic drugs for targeted cancer cells killing. Even if cancer cell survives it will be left with severely disrupted epigenetic landscape (oncogenes kept silenced, tumor surpressors remained open for transcription) until it dies which will make it more susceptible to the future conventional chemotherapy. However, precautions should be taken for some normal cells (i.e. germ cells) could remain sensitive to these drugs during childhood and puberty.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Each CpG island could be methylated. Generally it contributes to the silencing of downstream genes. There are several places across the genome where CpG islands could be found. Some of them are located in gene promotors, where they are kept unmethylated. However, CpG islands are hallmarks of various repetitive elements which - if kept unsilenced, may severely damage DNA be uncontrolled slef-insertions into the random places or chromosome linking. These CpG islands should be maintaned methylated all the time. CpG islands in gene promoters could be methylated if a gene is to be imprinted. Then methylation will spread from rather short flanking site or from an ICR.</p>
<p>In cancer situation regarding CpG methylation is ambiguous. On one hand CpG islands capable of gene-expression control tend to be hypermethylated thereby silencing neighboring genes (including tumor-suppresor genes), while intergenic <span>and repetitive elements</span> CpGs are hypomethylated contributing to the total genomic destabilisation. While this process could be fairly random location-wise, "proper" CpG methylation/demethylation events - say - switching off most potent tumor-suppresors, are readily selected during somatic evolution of a given cancer.</p></div>
