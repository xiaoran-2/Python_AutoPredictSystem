    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation at CpG is not typically seen in young, active cells (i.e., we typically see hypomethylation, although we occasionally see more methylation as we age) which allows activity of the corresponding genes. Increases in CpG island methylation are evidently seen in cancer, however, resulting in localized hypermethylation in the genome at these CpG islands. This specific disruption may be one factor that leads to the development of a tumour since this hypermethylation at CpG islands disrupting normal functioning of genes that may regulate normal growth, such as growth restricting genes or tumor supressor genes, which facilitates overgrowth and the potential development of tumours.</p>
<p>With regard to DNA methylation at a genome-wide level, such as within intergenic intervals and repetitive elements, DNA methylation typically helps to maintain genomic stability such as by ensuring proper chromosome composition and recombination (i.e., disallowing illegitimate recombinations between repeats). In cancer, however, widespread DNA methylation levels tend to decrease and thus genome-wide hypomethylation occurs. Within alterations to DNA methylation levels in intergenic intervals and repetitive elements, this hypomethylation promotes genomic instability, resulting in additional unwarranted chromosome recbominations such as additional chromosomal deletions, insertions and/or reciprocal translocations. Not only does this DNA hypomethylation directly introduce instability for genes involved in such recombinations, but also to adjacent genes, leading to a widespread disrpution of transcriptional activity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster on human chromosome 11, DNA methylation patterns typically show an unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele and a methylated ICR on the paternal allele (indicating maternal imprinting). Methylation in this cluster operates by blocking the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR, and since CTCF acts to block enhancers from activating an upstream region of Igf2, this results in expression of Igf2. Without methylation, such as on the materal allele, CTCF can readily bind to the ICR and block enhancers from activating Igf2, but instead enhancing H19 (although on the paternal H19 maintain some gene-silencing methylation).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting pattern typically observed in the H19/Igf2 cluster becomes disrupted, where hypermethylation of the ICRs result in ubiquitous CTCF blocking on both maternal and paternal alleles. This results in an entire loss of imprinting, and results in overexpression of Igf2, which functions as a growth promoting hormone, thus leading to excessive growth and potentially tumour growth (Wilm's tumour).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors identified as DNA-demethylating agents, or hypomethylating agents.  These agents operate by inhibiting the process of DNA methylation, and thus since Decitabine helps to limit the amount of DNA methylation, this allows for stable control of gene expression as discussed in Q1 and Q1. Decitabine acts to treat Myelodysplatic Syndrome (MDS), which is a precurorsor a specific form of Leukaemia, Myeologeneous Leukaemia. Furthermore, as evidenced in the work done by Dr. Baylin at John Hopkins School of Medicine, combination of an agent with a similar mode of action as Decitabine with a histone-deactylase inhibitor resulted in slowed tumour growth in patients, which occurs since epigenetic alterations brought about pharmacologically (as per Decitabine DNA-demethylation) cannot be reversed in growing tumour cells, thus impeding the growth of the tumour and potentiating similarly acting agents as well as standard chemotherapies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation directly effects the expression of the relevant genes involved, but also affect neighbouring genes as well as downstream activity in not only the genome but also in transcription factor pathways. The natural levels of DNA methylation for the genome is persistent throughout all somatic cells, however, and thus any alteration to DNA methylation brought about exogeneously remains unless these changes are once again actively reversed exogeneously. Though application of these exogeneous substances may not be beneficial when administered at periods known as sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods involve time intervals in development that reflect an extreme susceptibility to environmental alterations affecting both genetic and epigenetic development. Known sensitive periods regard two periods of heavy epigenetic reprogramming; these are the primordial germ cell development and the post/early implantation period. Application of an exogeneous substance that alters the epigenetic profile of a patient during a sensitive period may result in an overpronounced effect on epigenetic changes that may produce unwanted effects on the genome. Thus it would be inadvisable to treat pregnant patients, since the fetal environment would thereby change and incur widespread epigenetic changes during a period of epigenetic reprogramming, disrupting this process and thus all downstream acitivty.</p></div>
