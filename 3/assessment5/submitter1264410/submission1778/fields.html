    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be altered in cancer in two different ways:</p>
<p>1. hypermethylation of CpG islands</p>
<p>2. genome wide hypomethylation</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG islands in a promotor region of a gene influences whether this gene is expressed or not. In normal cells those CpG islands usually are kept free from methylation. When CpG islands in a promotor a methylated this leads to inactivation of the affected gene. In cancer those CpG islands can be hypermethylated which leads to silencing in the affected genes. When hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs in promotors of growth restricting genes or tumour suppressors this can lead to (uncontolled) proliferation and tumour growth.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements prevents antisense transcription and disruption of neighbouring genes by shading alternative start points and are related to replication timing. In cancer especially intragenic elements and repetitive elements are affected by genome wide hypomehtylation. This can lead to activation of repeats and promotors, antisense transcription and disruption of neighbouring genes. Futhermore hypomethylation in these areas can lead to illigitimate recombination between repeats due to more open chromatin structure because auf DNA hypomethylation. Illigitimate recombination is usually prevented by a more densely packaged chromatin in areas of methylated DNA. All in all one can conclude that genome wide hypomethylation leads to genomic instability which is a common feature in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually the imprint conrol region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allel which allows the CTCF inuslator to bind. Binding of CTCF prevents the enhancers to act on Igf2, so that Igf2 is not expressed. The ehancer then act on H19 instead.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated which prevents the CTCF insulator to bind. As a result the enhancers can now act on Igf2 and lead to Igf2 expression. Furthermore the H19 promotor ist methylated on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In nephroblastoma (Wilm's tumour) hypermethylation in found in the H19/Igf2 cluster. Which leads to hypermethylation of the ICR both in the maternal and paternal allele and therefore Igf2 expression from both alleles. This meas there is twice as much Igf2 expressed in those cells. As Igf2 is a growth promotor this leads to enhanced proliferation of the tumour cells and tumours growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyl transferase (DNMTi). It is derived from 5-azacytidine and acts in a similar way. Decibabine is a nucleoside analoge (cytidine analoge) which is incorporated into the DNA during replication. (Therefore Decitabine can only act in replicating cells.) When incorporated into DNA Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferase (DNMT). This means that DNMT cannot lay down methylation in the daughter strands of the DNA any more and the original methylation pattern of the cell cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>This could be useful in tumours that are mainly driven by hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes. Here inhibition of methylation might reconstitute the effect of the tumours suppressor genes and might suppress further tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation pattern of a cell is maintained in the daughter cells because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This means that influences on DNA methylation caused by a drug is as well inherited to the daugher cells of the originally treated cells and therefore can persist after therapy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time in which the epigenetic machinery is most active and remodeling occurs. This is the case in the early developement of the fetus and in the formation of the premordial germ cells. These periods are most susceptible to influences from the environment or influences made by medical treatment.  </p>
<p>When treating patients in a sensitive period with a drug that influences or disturbes the epigenetic machinery may cause severe side effects in the offsprings of the patients as well, as those changes are mitotically heritable.</p></div>
