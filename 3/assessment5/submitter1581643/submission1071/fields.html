    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When DNA methylation in cancer is considerered, it has to be differentiated two regions: (i) CpG islands and (ii) intergenic and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>CpG islands are usually found at the promoter region of genes. When these CpG islands are methylated, the genes are silenced. In cancer, CpG islands at the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated. This fact causes the absence of tumor suppressor mechanisms which alter the normal cell cycle. The alteration of the normal cell cycle can contribute to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells; it is thought that this methylation prevents from genomic instability. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, which contributes to genomic instability. Genomic instability causes alterations in DNA such as: deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. These alterations create cells with an abnormal genetic control, very prone to become cancer cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternal imprinted; it means that the paternal imprinted control region is methylated. Because of that, a insulator protein called CTCF can not join to the DNA and the Igf2 gene is expressed. </p>
<p>The maternal allele has its imprinted control regions unmethylated. Due to that, the CTCF protein goes there and insulates the Igf2 gene from the enhancers. The enhancers instead of acting at the Igf2 gene, they express a long non-coding RNA called H19.</p>
<p>Imprintig of the H19/Igf2 is abnormal in Wilm´s tumour because both of the alleles are methylated. So that, both alleles express Igf2, doubling the dosis of this oncogene. Because Igf2 is a growth promoter, this epigenetic alteration induces over growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. That means that Decitabine interact with DNA methyltransferases, blocking their action and reducing DNA methylation.It is thought that Decitabine anti-tumoural effect came from reducing the hypermethylation state of tumour suppressor promoters, allowing the expression of tumour suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained through cell division thanks to the role of DNA methyltranferases. However, methylation marks are cleared during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a developmental moment when most of epigenetic marks are cleared, and new ones are set. Due to that, these periods are very critical.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods: (i) pre-implantational early development and (ii) primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable because the epigenetic marks are being remodelled and it would be easier to modify them in a wrong way.  Moreover, it is known that these periods are very sensitive to toxics. </p></div>
