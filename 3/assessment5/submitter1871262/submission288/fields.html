    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands methylation is an epigenetic process that involves the addition of a methyl group to the citosine nucleotides in that 'group'/island of CG nucleotides. In normal cells, the CpG islands are found in the majority of mammalian promoters and it was hypothetized that they are essential for regulation of transcription and replication. These CpG islands are usually hypomethylated to allow normal gene expression, but in cancer cells it is possible to see them hypermethylated. When this hypermethylation is found in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes it inhibits its expression, allowing the cells to grow faster or not to die as much as it was expected, promoting cancer development. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions is needed to maintain genomic stability and also to maintain heterochromatine compact to avoid recombination between different chromosomes. Besides its hypermethylated state in normal cells, in cancer cells there is a hypomethylation of these regions, which leads to genomic instability - increasing the frequency of chromosomal recombination that give rise to chromosomal deletions or insertions - and also to oncogenic activation of cryptic promoters, leading to oncogene activation and tumorigenic progression.</p>
<p>Therefore, DNA methylation can be disregulated in cancer cells leading to inhibition of tumor suppressor genes or to increase of oncogenes expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells there is also a disruption of imprinting status. For example in normal cells, the maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster has the ICR hypomethylated, which allows the binding of CTCF which will induce the H19 expression, and the paternal allele has its ICR hypermethylated, which inhibits CTCF binding, allowing Igf2 expression by the enhancers in that locus. In Wilm’s tumor there is a hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 ICR of both alleles. That event leads to an increase in Igf2 expression by the paternal and also by the maternal allele. Since Igf2 is an important gene for cell growth, this disruption of imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster and consequent increase in Igf2 levels is enough for a disregulated cell growth that give rise to a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is part of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and it binds to DNA methyltransferase enzymes after they are incorporated into DNA, inhibiting their function. So Decitabine will decrease the hypermethylation that is usually found in cancer cells. By decreasing the hypermethylation in promoters of tumor suppressors Decitabine is able to restore the normal levels of tumor suppressors genes, controling the tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is inherited mitotically, even after the period of drug treatment it is possible to say that the cells acquire a ‘new memory’. For example if a certain therapeutic target (tumor suppressor gene) is, for example, hypomethylated after the therapeutic effect, the daughter cells will all be hypomethylated, and therefore ‘normal’.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is constant during lifetime and it is only restored in two sensitive epigenetic periods: the blastocist period and during the primordial germ cell development period. These periods are responsible for epigenetic resetting which not only deletes and re-establishes the imprinting marks, but also is important to prevent the existing epimutations to be passed onto the next generation. Therefore the treatment of patients during these sensitive periods would not be adequate because the therapeutic effect would be erased. </p></div>
