    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer cells is altered in two ways.  First, DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to activate or inactivate genes. In a normal cell CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes are unmethylated and oncogenes are methylated to prevent cancer development.  In a cancer cell the CpG islands are highly methylated at tumor suppressor genes preventing these genes from being expressed allowing the cell to proliferate unnaturally without a mutation to the gene itself.</p>
<p>Second, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in an active genes. In a normal cell this contributes to genomic stability. As cancer progresses the level of methylation in these regions decreases causing the DNA to become more open and unstable.  This exposes repetive elements leading to illegitimate recombination, activation of transposons and activation of cryptic promoters leading to the disruption of neighboring genes.  </p>
<p>These two events co-occur to produce a cell line with an increasingly unstable genome and the inability to undergo programmed cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a paternally imprinted allele meaning that the maternal allele is expressed.  On the paternal allele the is methylated from the imprint control region through the first part of the H19 promoter in a way that prevents CTCF from binding allowing the downstream promoters of Igf2 to begin transcription of Igf2 while preventing expression of paternal H19.  On the unmethylated maternal allele CTCF is free to bind insulating the promoter site for Igf2 allowing the maternal expression of H19 but not maternal Igf2.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumors develop in children who have inhereted two paternal-like alleles; meaning there is methylation on the maternal chromosome similar to methylation at the ICR of the paternal allele.  This results in the upregulation of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, allowing unregulated growth of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylated at imprinted regions is stable enough to be mitotically heritable.  Changing the epigenetics of a rapidly dividing cell could produce daughter cells passes along the existing epigenetic marks.  When a drug is administered to remove they do not return meaning that the cell is left in such a state that it can not survive because even a cancerous cell requires epigenetic marks to continue proliferating such as during cell division when certain marks are required for chomosome separation.  </p>
<p>There are periods during development when many marks are removed during normal organismal development referred to as sensitive periods.  One of them is during embryonic development when many of the epigenetic marks for germ cell survival are removed. The next one is during primordial germ cell development allowing the genes to be imprinted.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that a pregnant woman who recieves these drugs during embryogenesis or in the fetal stage of primordial germ cell development might be unable to produce a viable offspring since epigenetic marks required for development would be removed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabin is a DNMT inhibitor which effects the epigenetics via the histones.  It is used to bind to methyl transferases so that in a cancer cell where they are upregulated they have a lesser effect of methylating histones.  By inhibiting methylation this prevents the cancerous effect of opening the DNA on a wide scale, silencing gene expression that may be necessary for normal development, and increasing genomic instability.</p></div>
