<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG islands usually keep free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, CpG islands from cancer cells promoters tend to become hypermethylated. This hypermethylation causes the silencing of genes which expression is controlled from that promoter.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes is related with the apparition of tumor cells. The fact that DNA methylation, as epigenetic modification, is mitotically heritable makes possible the continuing growth of the tumor.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome is related with the maintenance of genomic instability. The alteration of methylation in those regions, in towards to hypomethylation causes modifications on the genomic structure. This hypomethylation of repetitive elements could cause aberrant paring of non-homologous chromosomes. Moreover, the hypomethylation on transposable elements involves a failure on their silencing letting them to move through the genome.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The H19/Igf2 cluster is regulated by imprinting. The cluster is composed by Igf2 locus, CTCF binding site, H19 locus and enhancer’s site. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In a normal cell, the paternal copy of this cluster is methylated at H19 locus which avoid the union of CTCF with its binding site. This cause the silencing of H19 gene and the activation of Igf2. The maternal copy does not have methylation at these locus so the CTCF is able to bind on its biding site causing the transcription of H19 gene and the silencing of Igf2.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" lang="en-us" align="justify" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In Wilm's tumor, there is a change on the imprinting status of the maternal copy making it work like the paternal one. This is because the H19 locus is methylated in both copies. The consequence of these change is the over expression of Igf2 which is a growth factor involved in the apparition on tumor cells.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

These kind of inhibitors are used as drugs for particular types of cancer as myelodysplastic syndromes.</span></span></span></p>

The genes affected by these epimutations and related with the apparition of cancer <span>are </span>usually tumor suppressor genes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">If these drug, Decitabine, works properly it would avoid the hypermethylation of CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes' promoters, maintaining their function safe.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark considered quite stable. Once these marks are set on the genome, they have a mitotically heritance ensuring that are maintained on the descendant cells.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">There are some sensitive periods in which the environment can influence on the establishment of the DNA methylation epigenetic marks. It is known that there are two main periods in mammals which can be consider as sensitive ones. They are the early development and de primordial germ cells development. In these two periods the epigenetic reprograming takes place and there are already some scientific studies that indicates the influences of the environment (such as drugs or others molecules) in the final result of the epigenetic marks establishment.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the case of the patients treated with a drug that alters DNA methylation patterns, the success of the treatment in combination with chemotherapy is related with the fact that the tumor cells are undifferentiated and therefore they are in a sensitive period.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">It would be advisable to study the consequences that these kind of treatments may trigger on normal cells.
