    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in CpG islands is a normal mechanism of gene silencing that is involved in the X-chromosome inactivation and in the maintenance of imprinted genes. It is also essential for determining the cell-type specific expression patterns of genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes that causes the tumor suppressor genes to be silenced. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes contributes to tumor growth and its progression.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is the maintenance of genomic integrity and stability. Methylation in these regions was found to silence cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. Methylation in repeats prevents their transposition through (1) silencing of the repeats and (2) through its mutagenic function as mutation of the repeats (meC to T) prevents transposition of the repeats. In fact, Prof. Timothy Bestor’s genome defense model suggests that the methylation in repeats, which is mutagenic, is beneficial by protecting the genome from transposable elements.  In addition, silencing of the repeats prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters and may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there is a global change in the methylation makeup of the genome. In fact, a genome-wide lack of methylation was historically the earliest epigenetic aberration found in cancer. The hypomethylation in intergenic regions especially in repetitive elements contributes to the disease by causing genomic instability. The outcome is the presence of additional deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. Also, hypomethylation activates repeats, which means that the repeats have the ability to replicate themself and jump around the genome, disrupting the coding region of genes. Hypomethylation of the repetitive elements causes the neighboring genes to be activated. Taken together, hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions in cancers leads to genomic instability and transcriptional aberrations in the surrounding genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disrupting imprinting is a common feature of cancer causing aberrant expression of growth promoting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.  E.g., disruption of Kcnql and H19/Igf2 clusters, leading to loss of Cdkn1c tumor suppressor and upregulation of the oncogene Igf2 was found in Beckwith Wiedenmann syndrome, which is associated with predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors such as Wilm’s tumor. The aberrant gene expression happens because of loss of maternal allele function due to (1) mutation/deletion causing loss of imprinting, (2) uniparental disomy, and (3) epigenetic disruption. The H19 and Igf2 are reciprocally imprinted genes regulated by differentially methylated imprint control region (ICR) and by specific enhancers downstream of H19. The ICR is methylated on paternal chromosome, but unmethylated on maternal chromosome. The unmethylated ICR binds the insulator CTCF, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers thus silencing its expression. The enhancers act on H19 enhancing its expression. On the paternal allele the methylated ICR cannot bind CTFC thus the enhancers are free to interact with the Igf2 promoting its expression. The reason why the H19 is no longer active on paternal allele is because of heterochromatin spreading or DNA methylation spreading. The methylation in ICR spread downstream to the promoter of H19 silencing its.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs together with azatidine to a group of epigenetic drugs that function as DNA-demethylating agents due to their ability to inhibit DNA methyltransferase. Both drugs are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. In addition, azacidine in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor was effective in treating solid tumors such as advanced lung cancer. The treatment was beneficial by either directly slowing tumor growth in some patients or by making the tumor cells more susceptible to the subsequent standard chemotherapies in other patients. It has been suggested that these epigenetic drugs are capable of producing mitotically heritable changes in tumor cells -passed on to daughter cells, until they are actively erased- that make the tumor cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapies. Therefore, it is possible that epigenetic therapies cause the tumor cells to stop growing without having to kill them all.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The effect of epigenetic drugs on tumor cells might last beyond the treatment because epigenetic changes such as decreased DNA-methylation are passed on during cell division to the daughter cells. When treating patients with epigenetic drugs, we should consider that these drugs have the potential to affect every cell, not only cancer cells. A general disruption of epigenetic machinery by anti-tumor drugs can therefore produce unwonted long term side effects. In case of older patients or patients with advanced cancer this side effects are usually neglected because the primary goal of the treatment is patient survival and improvement of their life quality. However, when treating young patients, we should keep in mind that epigenetic drugs might cause long term side effects not only in respect to the patient him/herself but also to their progeny when they are treated during epigenetically sensitive periods. The epigenetically sensitive period is a period of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. During these periods a reprogramming of epigenetic marks takes place.  Therefore, general disruption of epigenetic machinery by e.g., pharmacological manipulation of the DNA-methylation can produce abnormalities that can be lethal for the embryo or can be transmitted to next generations through the germ cells.</p></div>
