    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the CpG islands are not or almost not methylated. This allows the gene to be transcribed. In cancer cells, a lot of the CpG islands are methylated. When this targets a tumor surpressor gene, it means that the gene won't be transcribed anymore and this can cause tumor to grow. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are methylated. This causes genomic stability. In cancer cells, these regions are unmethylated. This causes genomic instability. The repetitive elements are able to 'jump' around the genome with help from transposons. When the element then places itself in a important gene, the function of this gene is disturbed. A protein will be made, which doesn't look like the original protein and the protein will probably have a lack of function or a different fuction than it should have. This can cause accumulation of growth factors or the lack of surpressor proteins.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting site on the paternal allele is methylated (imprinted) and the imprinting site on the maternal allele is unmethylated (not imprinted). Igf2 will not be expressed from the maternal allele and it will be expressed from the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal imprinting site is methylated and thus imprinted. Because of this, the maternal Igf2 and the paternal Igf2 will be expressed. This causes a double dose of the growth factor and this can cause tumours. So this is when you have double imprinting. When none of the genes is imprinted, there won't be expression of the Igf2 growth factor and this can cause problems in development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. DNA methyltransferases can place a methylgroup on a site of the DNA. When you are using drugs that inhibit this process, less of the DNA will be methylated. In cases where tumor surpressor genes are methylated, you could present a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor, so the gene will become less methylated. Now the gene can be transcribed again and can do it's job as tumour surpressor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is something thatyour cell can 'remember'. In each cell division, the marks are preserved in the cells. So, when my tumour surpressor gene is methylated in one cell, all the daugther cells will have a methylated tumour surpressor gene as well. The sensitive period, is the time in development in which the epigenetic marks such as methylation and acetylation are removed and newly placed. This happens when your in the blastocyst stage and also in the primordial germ cells. Because these are really important periods and you wouldnt want all of you gene to be methylated or unmethylated or the genes that should be methylated become unmethylated and vice versa, it's not a good thing to use the epigenetic drugs during this stage of development. You could make a lot of mistakes during this period and a lot of mistaks can happen with the new epigenetic marks, which can lead to disease themselfs. </p></div>
