    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alters in cancer by the hypermethylation or silencing of the CpG islands and the CpG islands shores of the tumor supperos genes as well as the hypomethylation of the Genome wide DNA.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the CpG island is hypomethylated and the intergenic region and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes causing the loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Genome wide DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability which contributes to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Distruption of impriting can contribute to cancer the hypermethylation of ICRs which causes the overexpression of Igf2 overexpression in Wilm's tumor, where the maternal H19 gets hypermethylated which inturn prevents the enhancers from acting on promoting the paternal Igf2 causing it to loose the imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-demethylating agent decitabine, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>
<p>A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This happened because it was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma. And because, some of the participants show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.</p>
<p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation, with its stable and heritable nature regarding gene regulation, offers an ideal substrate for long-lasting cellular changes, and thus has been the most commonly studied epigenetic modification regarding experience-induced changes in the postnatal environment which is considered to be a sensitive period. </span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods are <span>early environmental influences and infant-caregiver experiences produce lasting epigenetic modifications, stable changes in CNS gene activity, and behavior.</span></span></p></div>
