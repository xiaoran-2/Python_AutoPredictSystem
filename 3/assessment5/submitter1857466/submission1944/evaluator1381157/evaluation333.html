    <div class="field-name" id="e576a4ddbe0a2940">Please make any overall comments here.</div>
    <div class="field-value">Question 1
1)Answer is correct
2)Answer is correct
3) You mixed up a few things. In cancer there is indeed hypermethylation, but not of ICR's, there is hypermethylation of CpG Islands/shores. Therefor I could not grade you with a perfect score here, so a 1
4)Correct but not complete 
5&6)Eventhough I wished you went a bit more into detail here , I still think the answers are good, so both a 2
5)
Question 2
1&2) You did not provide an answer to these questions. 
3) Your answer is incorrect. In Wilms tumor, imprinting is lost due to the fact that also the maternal ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind the maternal ICR, en thus will the enhancers (like on the paternal allele) act on the promoter of Igf2, leading to the double of the normal dose of Igf2 (expression on both the maternal and paternal allele)
4)Answer seems incomplete. Why will overexpression of Igf2 lead promote tumor growth? Therefor I graded a 1

Question 3
1) Eventhough worded diffenently, your answer is correct (DNMTinhibotors indeed are DNA demethylating agents), so I graded a 2
2)Since you said Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, I think I can count this as a correct answer, so I graded a 2
3)You did not provide any answer to this question (effect of DNMTi's on  reactivating tumor surpressor genes that previousely were inactivated due to methylation) Sorry, but I graded a 0

Question 4
1) You mentioned the "stable and heritable nature" of DNA methylation, so I grade this answer as correct. A 2
2) I don't think you completely provide a correct answer here, but it also doesnt seem completely wrong, so I grade a 1
3) Incomplete and also for most part incorrect, so I cannot grade this. Sorry
4) Some parts of your answer seem right, other doesnt or are incomplete, so I graded a 1</div>
