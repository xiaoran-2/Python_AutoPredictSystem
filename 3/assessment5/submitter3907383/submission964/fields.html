    <div class="field-value"><p>In most normal cells, CpG islands remain unmethylated.  CpG islands often appear at promoters near the beginnings of genes.  Since this is where transcription factors will bind for those genes, these islands remain unmethylated in order to stay open for binding and therefore the gene can be expressed.  However, in cancer, these areas are frequently methylated, silencing genes by either condensing the chromatin or by blocking transcription factors.  This methylation serves to silence tumor suppressor genes.  The particular CpG islands affected by DNA methylation varies by tumor type.  If the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, then cancer cells can rapidly replicate and tumors will grow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking at other regions of the genome, a different pattern of DNA methylation is found. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells are usually methylated.  It is thought that this methylation protects the genome from instability.  At intergenic regions, methylation blocks hidden transcription sites or hidden splice sites, so that unwanted transcription or splicing will not occur. Methylation silences the repetitive elements so that they will not “jump” around or be transposed to another part of the genome. DNA methylation promotes mutation in these areas, so that the repeats may be disrupted by CG à TG mutations.  It also protects from abnormal chromosome recombination during meiosis.  Frequently strong promoters are found within repetitive elements.  Silencing these strong promoters by DNA methylation can prevent interference from transcription occurring in the wrong place or in the wrong direction.  In cancer cells, intergenic and repetitive regions are hypomethylated, leaving these regions of chromatin uncondensed and therefore open to transcription.  The genome stability protection is lost. Oncogenes may become activated.  Abnormal chromosomal recombination tends to occur when similar regions, such as repetitive elements, are left uncondensed during meiosis. Repeats tend to “jump” around, potentially disrupting normal genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some genes in the genome are “imprinted” by epigenetic marks.  In these imprinted regions, only one allele is supposed to be expressed – either the maternal or the paternal allele.  Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.  The Igf2 gene is an example of a growth factor gene that is imprinted.  In the paternal allele the ICR (imprint control region) and the promoter area of the H19 gene is methylated.  Enhancers, found further down the DNA strand, are able to act upon the Igf2 gene allowing it to be expressed from the paternal allele.  In the maternal allele, there is no methylation at the ICR.  An insulator protein, CTCF, insulates the unmethylated ICR, blocking the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene.  Instead the enhancers activate H19, an unrelated long non-coding RNA.  Therefore, normally, the Igf2 gene is only expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, both the maternal and the paternal alleles are methylated at the ICR.  Since both are methylated at the ICR, the enhancers activate the expression of Igf2 from both alleles, producing a double dose of this growth factor, leading to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>According to the Economist article, Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome.  It belongs to the class of drugs known as DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitors.  Decitabine removes methyl groups from DNA by inhibiting DNMTs, which are enzymes which normally place methyl groups as epigenetic marks on the DNA.  In some cancers, DNA methylation may silence tumor suppressor genes which normally keep cell division under control.  If these genes are silenced, then cell division is not controlled, which causes increased growth of the tumor.  Drugs which can remove methyl groups from the DNA can serve to open up the chromatin, release the tumor suppressor genes, allowing their expression and they can do their job controlling the growth of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is methylated by enzymes known as DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases).  One particular enzyme, DNMT1, is responsible for passing on these epigenetic marks from the old DNA strand to the new DNA strand during the process of replication when cell division occurs.  In this fashion, DNA methylation state is maintained throughout a cell lineage.  If a drug alters the methylation state of DNA, then that methylation state will be passed on during cell division.  If erased, it will not return, since DNMT1 is only responsible for maintaining the marks that are already present.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two main sensitive periods when the epigenome is being reprogrammed.  The first occurs in early embryonic development.  From fertilization until the blastocyst phase, most DNA methylation is removed. Then new marks are laid down according to cell type.  Another sensitive period occurs when primordial germ cells are being formed.  In these cells, somatic cell marks must be removed and special germ cell marks set down in order to become an egg or a sperm cell. During these sensitive periods, it would be unwise to treat the patient with drugs that will alter DNA methylation because the drugs may interfere with normal epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
