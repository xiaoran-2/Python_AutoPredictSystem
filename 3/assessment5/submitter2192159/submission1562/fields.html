    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. In cancer CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are highper methylated, so these genes expression is inhibited. Whereas growth promoting genes promoters are hypo methylated. In normal cells intergeneric and repetitive elements are highper methylated. Because of this DNA gets condensed to form heterochromatin regions. In this heterochromatin region recombination and activation of transposons not occur. In cancer intergeneric and repetitive elements are hypo methylated where as in normal cells these regions are highper methylated. With this consequence genome instability occurs. Like illegitimate recombination, activation of transposons, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal chromosome ICR (imprinted control region) is methylated, this methylation blocks the binding of CTCF insulator protein. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to active.  </p>
<p> In maternal chromosome ICR (imprinted control region) is un methylated, this will allow the binding of CTCF insulator protein.  This CTCF insulator protein will not access the binding of enhancer to Igf2 and inactivate the expression of Igf2 and activate the expression of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor is imprinted disorder, in this up regulation of Igf2 and loss of Cdkn1c occur. This disorder caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, mutation or deletion of imprinting region, uniparental disomy- tow copies of one parental chromosomes and epigenetic disruption for loss of imprinting.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cytosine analogue 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine (decitabine) is the currently most advanced drug for epigenetic cancer therapies. This compound functions as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. After decitabine have been metabolized to 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine- triphosphate, they can become substrates for the DNA replication machinery and will be incorporated into DNA, where azacytosine can substitute for cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized by the DNA methyltransferases as natural substrate and the enzymes will initiate the methylation reaction by a nucleophilic attack. This results in the establishment of irreversible covalent bond between the carbon-6 atom of the cytosine ring and the enzyme. Thus, the enzyme remains covalently bound to DNA and its DNA methyltransferase function is blocked.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  Altering DNA methylation pattern will alter the gene expression pattern thereby results in repression of the genes. So indeed it plays a crucial role in development apart from involving the genome.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the one where genome is more susceptible to epigenetic changes under the  influence of environment.  During this period     active reprograming of genome takes place during this period. Hence genome is most sensitive to changes in environment.</p>
<p>Period between development of Primordial germ cells to gametes and from Pre-implantation and early post-implantation period are sensitive periods of development.</p>
<p>As the active reprograming of genome takes place during this sensitive period any changes in the genome through epigenome modifications would alter the gene  expression pattern of the genes hence showing deleterious effects. Hence it is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</p></div>
