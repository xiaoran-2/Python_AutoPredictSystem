    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is the covalent addition of a methyl group at C5 position of a citosine nucleotide, usually occurring at citosines followed by a guanine, known as CpG. Regions rich in CpG dinucleotides are called CpG islands (CGI). In general, CGI found in promoter regions are protected from methylation, independent of the activation status of genes. When methylated, CGI tend to silence the genes under its control, since methylation makes it difficult for transcription factors and the transcription machinery to gain access to the DNA. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">As a general rule, cancer cells have a genome-wide hipomethylation and loci specific hypermethylation. In cancer, CGI tend to be hypermethylated, causing gene silencing. When this occurs in tumor suppressor genes the outcome is an increased proliferation. In some cancers, it is also seen methylation of CpG island shores, i.e. regions nearby CGI as an alteration in the methylation pattern. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are kept methylated in order to ensure genomic stability. In cancer, those regions tend to be hipomethylated which in turn can cause unwanted activation of sequences such as transposons, causing genomic instability. This hipomethylation also favors the illegimate recombination between chromosomes contributing to genomic alterations seen in cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Imprinted genes are those that exhibit preferential parental expression, i.e. only the maternal or the paternal allele will be expressed. Imprinted genes are under control of Imprinting Control Regions (ICR) that regulates which allele will be silent and which will be active.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the case of the imprinted genes H19 and Igf2, the ICR that controls both genes is methylated in the paternal allele but not in the maternal allele. The protein CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele which in turn inhibits the interaction between the downstream enhancer and the Igf2 gene, silencing this allele from the mother. At the same time, this inhibition allows the enhancers to interact with the H19 gene, turning on its expression. As a result, the Igf2 expressed is paternal and the H19 expression is maternal.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is hipermethylated, therefore disrupting the biding of CTFT to ICR and causing activation of the maternal Igf2 allele. It codes for a growth promoter, responsible for a fenotype characterized by exacerbated growth of the kidney and other aberrant characteristics.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA demethylation-inducing drug. It inhibits DNA-methyltransferases therefore inducing hipomethylation. In cancers that rely on hypermethylation as means for growth, hipomethylation has the potential to turn back on genes that have been pathologically silenced, after several cell divisions. Decitabine then promote its tumor-supressor effects by altering the DNA methylation machinery.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long-lasting affects because DNA methylation is a stable modification that is passed on to the daughter cells after cell division. Because of this, cells generated from treated cells inherit the DNA methylation pattern acquired after the treatment, as if themselves have been treated. That is why even after the treatment the cells maintain the epigenetic alterations that sometimes can make them more susceptible to the standard chemotherapies. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The DNA methylation profile of a cell is stable mitotically, i.e. is maintained through cell divisions in somatic cells. Conversely in the primordial germ cells (PGC), the DNA methylation pattern is erased as well as in the zygote right after fertilization, in a process called epigenetic reprogramming. These two periods are considered sensitive periods since any alteration in the reprogramming can disrupt the epigenome of the gametes or the newly generated embryo.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Disruption of the DNA methylation machinery during the sensitive periods can have effects on the pattern of imprinted genes causing aberrant expression of alleles. That is why it is unadvisable using this kind of drug in these periods. </span></p></div>
