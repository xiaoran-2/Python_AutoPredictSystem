    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often situated at the promoters of genes - promoters being at the start of genes where transcription machinery binds. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, as methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the gene expression.</p>
<p>However in cancer cells the CpG islands become hypermethylated. This may lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. This hypermethylation is considered as one of the 'hits' according to the Kndson hypothesis. And cancer is the result of multiple hits to the DNA. Hypermethylation of CpG islands occurs frequently in tumours and is mitotically heritable. The cancer type CIMP, is where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. These regions and repetative elements are methylated to maintain genomic integrity, and repeats are silenced to prevent transposition. Silencing the repeats also avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters which prevents illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p>However lack of methylation genome wide was the earliest epigenetic aberation found. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, causing cancer, as it is more likely for deletions, insertions and translocations to occur. This feature is found in all cancers ever studied and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>The consequences of hypomethylation depend on the location. For example; hypomethylation at the CpG poor promoters leads to oncogene activation, and hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions equals genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of imprint control regions(ICR) leads to loss of imprinting. This is a common early event in cancer and often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and this DNA methylation speads to the H19 promoter and silences it. This allows the downstream enhancers to access Igf2 and activate it, meaning Igf2 is expressed. On the maternal allele the ICR is insulated by the protein CTCF. This means the downstream enhancers cannot access Igf2 meaning it is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele behaves like the cluster on the paternal allele. This is due to loss of imprinting on the ICR allowing the enhancers to access Igf2 on the maternal allele aswell as the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting so this disruption to imprinting contributes to the disease by enhancing tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. These drugs target enzymatic epigenetic regulators and in this case the enzyme DNA methyltransferases. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a drug used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and also for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent; it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span class="hw">Sensitive periods of development are defined as, a specific time during which the environment has its greatest impact on an individual's development. It is also the time during gestation when critical organ systems are formed. Examples of these times are early development and primordial germ cell development.</span></p>
<p><span class="hw">These factors need to be considered when using drugs to treat cancer. Altering DNA methylation could cause unwanted side effects if a drug effects other cells in the body rather than just the tumour cells. Hypermethylation or hypomethylation could cause long term problems, which may also be passed on to the future generations.</span></p></div>
