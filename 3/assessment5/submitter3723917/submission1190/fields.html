    <div class="field-value"><p align="left">Two established alterations in cancer are locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. DNA at CpG islands is usually protected from methylation  in normal cells. In contrast, DNA methylation of CpG islands in cancer cells is more dense and progresses with time. DNA methylation at CpG islands at promotors is associated with gene silencing. Therefore, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands at promotors may suppress tumour suppressor genes. DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually methylated and contributes to maintain genomic integrity and stability. The level of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is decreased in cancer and also progresses with time. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability and may cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Abnormal karyotype such as deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations may be induced due to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal DNA at ICR is methylated and imprinting of <em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2 </em>cluster is maintained and blocks an insulator protein CTCF binding. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence and downstream enhancers can access <em>Igf2 </em>to activate, and <em>Igf2</em> gene is expressed. In contrast, the maternal DNA at ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind to ICR and insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers. Enhancers acts on <em>H19</em>, and I<em>gf2</em> gene is not expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated and the imprinting at the <em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2</em> cluster is disrupted and <em>Igf2</em> gene expression is doubled. <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster cannot act as the enhancer blocking player on maternal allele. Overexpression of growth promoting I<em>gf2</em> gene as an early event seen in kidney may cause Wilm’s tumor in children.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="left">Decitabine belongs to a DNA methytransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark and is laid down or maintained by several methytransferases, (DNMTs). Decitabicin irreversibly bind DNMTs after being incorporated into DNA upon replication, and Decitabicin inhibits DNMTs’ action because DNMTs can no longer be released. Thus, the action of Decitabine is division dependent and cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells will be more severely affected. Although the role of DNA methylation in cancer depends on tumor type and stage of disease, Decitabine at lower doses inducing DNA demethylation has a very good anti-neoplastic effect especially in hematological malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome that might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="left">DNA methylation as one of main epigenetic mechanisms needs to be stably maintained during cell divisions to conserve cellular identity but also react to cell intrinsic signals during development or to external factors to adapt to altered environmental conditions.</p>
<p align="left">DNA methylation is essential for viability, as DNMT knockouts mice die in utero. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to features of DNMT and is passed on during cell division to subsequent cell generations. If epigenetic changes are induced by an epigenetic modifier such as DNMT inhibitor and suppress a cancer growth without killing all cancer cells, the changes will be transmitted to next generations of cells and the anti-cancer effects of the drug will last longer after stopping taking it.</p>
<p align="left">Clearing of DNA methylation as epigenetic reprogramming occurs during two sensitive periods----primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients with a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery during these two periods may have profound effects on patients and their offspring. Caution is needed especially for younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells in sensitive periods.</p></div>
