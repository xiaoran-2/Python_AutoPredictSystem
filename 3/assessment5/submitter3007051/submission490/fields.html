    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at the promotors of genes and are generally protected from methylation. If the CpG island is methylated however, this means the gene is silenced. This hypermethylation of CpG islands is what happens in cancer. When the CpG island in a promotor for a tumour supressor gene is methylated and silenced, it follows that the development of the tumour can no longer be supressed by this gene.</p>
<p>Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genomic stability. Hypomethylation in these areas is present in all types of tumour. Over time, the hypomethylation increases. The hypomethylation mainly occurs at the repeats. The consequences and outcome depend on the location of the hypomethylation. Removal of the methylation means pieces of chromatin can be deleted, inserted or swapped between chromosomes, i.e. genomic instability. Once the methylation is removed, the chromatin becomes more open. Repetitive elements can be activated. Active repetitive elements jump around the genome, causing disruption. For instance, genes that shouldn't be transcribed are transcribed, or the repetitive elements recombine where they shouldn't, disrupting the surrounding genes. All this disruption effects the functioning of the genes, e.g. tumour suppressors no longer work or oncogenes are enhanced, and this leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. Therefore the CTCF insulator protein can't bind with it and can't insulate the Igf2 cluster. The enhancers are free to work on the Igf2 cluster and Igf2 is expressed. The methylation of the ICR spreads to the promotor of the H19 cluster, silencing the expression of H19.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR, and therefore there is no methylation to spread to H19. The unmethylated ICR is now bound by the CTCF insulator protein. The protein insulates the Igf2 cluster and the enhancers enhance the expression of H19 instead. The preferred loop is between the enhancers and Igf2, but because Igf2 is insulated the second loop occurs instead, i.e. they enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>Deletions or mutations, or inheriting two copies of the paternal chromosome (or in rare cases epigenetic disruptions) lead to a loss of imprinting. The maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele and the function of the maternal allele is lost. The tumour suppressor Cdkn1c is not expressed by the maternal allele and both alleles express the Igf2 ongonene which promotes growth and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase. The agent is analogue to nucleotides and gets incorporated into the DNA when replication takes place. When the DNA methyltransferase binds to it to copy the methylation to the daughter stand, it gets bound irreversibly. It can no longer be released and the methylation of the daughter strand does not take place. The cell has to replicate for the drug to work. As cancer cell divide more quickly than other cells they are most effected by the drug.</p>
<p>If a CpG island in a promotor for a tumour suppressor gene is no longer methylated due to the described effects of Decitabine, the gene regains it function and is able to suppress the tumour again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If DNA methylation has been altered by incorporating DNMT inhibitor into the DNA, the inhibitor will get replicated along with the rest of the genome during subsequent cell divisions. So, many divisions later, the alteration will still be there preventing methylation.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a stage of development during which the epigenetic marks are removed and laid down again (reprogramming). The epigenetic marks are first removed in early development after fertilisation but before implantation. After implantation they are laid down again. The second phase of reprogramming is in the development of the primordial germ cells. These cells are reprogrammed with the epigenetic marks specific to the function of the germ cell.</p>
<p>If a young patient with still developing germ cells received treatment with epigenetic drugs, the epigenetic marks the germ cells received could also be disrupted. Vital epigentic marks may not be implemented. The germ cells might not function, leading to infertility.</p></div>
