    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-17eef0acde63ca4beebc3cdf/970238/asst-5/970238-5211f4cf5a6e47.58082235.jpg" alt="" /><br />Some genes are imprinted, that is, one allele is always expressed from one parent only. In H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele express H19 by binding of CTCF to the unmethylated ICR (imprinting control region) and this makes the enhancers downstream of H19 to bind to ICR instead of igf2 and thus igf2 is silenced. The key gene is igf2, which in the paternal allele must be expressed through methylation of the H19. In paternal allele ICR is methylated (and beginning of H19), so H19 is silenced, the enhancers cannot act over ICR because it is methylated and act over igf2: expression of igf2 occurs.</p>
<p>If loss of imprinting occurs, hypermethylated maternal and paternal alleles leads to activation of both igf2 copies: an overexpression of igf2 takes place, which is a growth promoting. Loss of H19 expression also contributes to genome instability through polyploidization. The disease in which both copies of igf2 are expressed is known as Wilm´s tumor, a children cancer type, which complies with being a disorder which occurs in the early developing stages, where imprinting pattern take place. So, in order to be a normal cell only one copy of igf2 must be expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMTi, that is, a DNA-demethyltransferase inhibitor. The way it acts, is by blocking de novo methylation of DNA. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogous, and when the methylation machinery (DNMT1) of the cell try to methylate the daughter strand like the original after its replication, the analogous bind to the DNA but does not release the methyltransferase, so it is bound irreversibly and cannot act in other place any more. As much replication occurs, less DNMT1 will be available to make methylations, so it is replication dependent. As malignant cells have a especially high replication rate, this treatment acts especially over them: it forces slowed tumour growth.</p>
<p>This drug can be used to treat a precursor of the acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands use to be in promoter gene regions, and their normal methylation is associated with the expression of that gene, in this case, non-expression if methylated. Thus, a CpG region of a gene in a certain normal cell type that must be expressed will be unmethylated while in one other normal type where must be silenced would be methylated. In general, in normal cells CpG islands use to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Epimutations that alter the cell cycle, like those which increase the reproductive rate or longevity, are rapidly selected. In cancer a mismethylation of the promoter region in the CpG islands occurs: It is observed hypermethylations which especially silence tumor suppressor genes, what offers an advantage to the cell in their life cycle. The hypermethylation pattern is specific of tumor type.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, and are involved in the regulation of near genes and, mainly, in the genomic stability. In cancer, this normal function is disrupted, changing their methylation pattern: hypomethylation in cancer, what lead to instability because of an increase of reciprocal translocations between chromosomes, as they have long repeats regions where can contribute to illegitimate recombination. Insertions and deletions can take place in the chromosomes as well. This is because the repeats and the transposition are active and can be activated cryptic promoters if hypomethylation occurs, as well as the disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that can alter DNA methylation produce a lasting effects, as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and any changes made in the methylation of the DNA will be passed to daugthers cells when replication take place. There is a complete machinary to reproduce the methylation patterns from the cell to its linage. This pattern is stablished in certain periods, called sensitive periods, but some drugs can alter this pattern. In this case, these drugs must not be used in the sensitive periods, because methylations of the DNA are been stablished and with them the natural pattern would be disrupted.</p>
<p>These sensitive periods depends on the cell type and which part of the genome is going to be methylated, because imprinted genes, repeats or the genome itself depending on being maternal or paternal is methylated in a different stage and speed: somatic cells in the early development in preimplantatory period, and gametic cells during the germ cell development: in the case of women occurs even in the adult stage, in men earlier. There are sensitive periods in certain tissues during its development, even after birth, like in glucocorticoid receptors in hypocampus occurs (seen in mice).</p></div>
