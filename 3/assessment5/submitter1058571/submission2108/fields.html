    <div class="field-value"><p>The changes in DNA methylation that are altered in cancer result in changes in gene expression and an overall change in function. DNA methylation at CpG islands controls whether or not underlying genes are expressed. Normally CpG islands are unmethylated. This allows the underlying genes to function in an uninhibited manner. In cancer however, these CpG islands become methylated. As a result the underlying genes are not expressed. This hypermethylation can contribute to disease and cancer because often times these CpG islands are located at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. As a result of increased DNA methylation, these tumor suppressor genes that would normally function are inhibited. This can lead to an increased rate of cell replication and a reduction of cell death. Over time these cells can out compete other cells and with additonal mutations become cancerous. The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitve elements is to silence repeats and intergenic intervals which promotes genetic stability. However in cancer these regions become hypomethylated. Once these repeats and intergenic regions are no longer methylated, these components can become active and increase genomic instability. These activations can result in errant recombinations between repeats. It can also lead to the transposition or jumping of repeats from one location to another in the genome disrupting genes. Finally it can result in the activation of cryptic promoter which can disrupt nearby genes (such as in Axin fused alleles). All of these examples of genomic instability can lead to reduced or improper functioning of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of how disruption of parental imprinting can contribute to cancer. In this cluster, the maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR (imprinted control region). This allows CTCF (an insulator protein) to bind to the ICR. This results in the activation of the enhancers which in turn activate the gene H19, but avoid the secondary pathway of Igf2. In contrast in the paternal allele, there is methylation at the ICR which extends to the gene H19. This results in CTCF unable to bind to the ICR and the silencing of H19. As a result the enhancers are able to activate the secondary pathway of Igf2. Overall, one copy of Igf2 and one copy of H19 are activated. However in Wilm's tumour (cancer), hypermethylation of the maternal cluster results in the methylation of the ICR and H19. This results in the maternal cluster acting like the paternal cluster and expressing Igf2 instead of H19. This results in the combined clusters expressing two copies or upregulation of Igf2. This distruption of imprinting at the cluster can lead to disease because Igf2 is an oncogene. Its regulaton promotes excessive growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine may be used to reduce the epigenetic problems that are caused by cancer. Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi's). This class of inhibitors and Decitabine in general cause a reduction in DNA methylation. This drug is incorporated into the DNA of the patient. When the patients cells divide, DNMT is irreversibly binded to the drug. This results in an increase in DNA demethylation because the DNMT is no longer able to methylate the daughter strand of DNA being replicated. This may have an anti tumor effect because it reduces the hypermethylation of CpG islands. This would result in an increase in tumour suppressor gene activity. However the complete mechanism of the action of this type of drug is not understood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. The changes that the drug causes will be maintained in the cell and will be passed down to daughter cells for the life of the organism. Because of this fact, it is important not to treat patients at certain sensitive periods of development. At these points the epigenome can be easily damaged. A sensitive period is defined as a time in development where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. During these times, an organism is extremely sensitive to epigenetic changes. The two sensitive periods are pre implantation early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. During these times, epigenetic marks are first cleared and then reestablished. If a drug is used at this time it has the potential to either prevent correct clearing of epigenetic marks or prevent the correct reestablishment of those marks. If either of these errors occurs it could result in severe changes in gene expression that could lead to disability or death.</p></div>
