    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands</strong>, where CpG density is high, are usually found upstream of genes, in about 60% of promoters (Sharma, et al. 2010), and <strong>in normal cells are usually kept free of methylation</strong>. However, if methylation occurs at CpG islands of gene promoter, this results in silencing of a gene.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated</strong>, which causes silencing of the underlying gene. This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable.   However, unlike genetic mutation, hypermethylation is reversible.<strong> If the underlying gene is a tumor suppressor gene, its silencing will result in development of a tumor.</strong> The unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was first identified in colorectal cancer, and later gliomas, neuroblastoma and other cancers. The actual set of CpGs that are methylated differ by tumor type, which can be used for diagnostics.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic</strong> <strong>methylation is found at repetitive sequences</strong>, such as satellite repeats, which may comprise more than 2/3 of human genome (de Koning, et al. 2011). Methylation of these regions <strong>prevents them from recombination</strong>, and therefore plays an important role in genome stability.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer, intergenic regions are hypomethylated</strong>, primarily at satellite repeats. This results, on one hand, in an <strong>increased transcription of these regions</strong> and, on the other, in <strong>genomic instability due to possible recombination</strong> of the hypomethylated repeats. In particular, no global hypomethylation, but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach (Feber, et al. 2011). Increased transcription of satellite repeats was also detected in murine and human breast cancer cells deficient in tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (Zhu, et al. 2011), as well as in pancreatic and other epithelial cancers (Ting, et al. 2011).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent</strong>.  It <strong>hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</strong> as a result of making covalent bonds with it (Hagemann, et al. 2011).</p>
<p>Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). <strong>Inhibition of DNMTs has been successfully used in epigenetic cancer therapy to reverse epimutations and to reactivate  epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes</strong> (Hagemann, et al. 2011).</p>
<p>Besides, at low doses, DAC treatment has been shown to induce <strong>apoptosis (dying) of NB4 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) cells</strong>, which was associated with the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (Soncini, et al. 2013).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, <strong>H19/Igf2 cluster is metylated on paternal and unmethylated on maternal chromosome</strong>. Imprinting of paternal allele is performed though <strong>enhancer blocking mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>More specifically, <strong>on maternal allele</strong>, “insulator” protein CTCF binds unmethylated imprint control region (ICR), resulting in prevention of enhancer binding to Igf2 gene, so that Igf2 will not be expressed. Instead, expressed is lncRNA H19, which serves a reservoir for a particular MacroRNA.</p>
<p><strong>On paternal allele</strong>, protein CTCF does not bind metylated ICR, so enhancers bind Igf2 and express it, but lncRNA H19 is not expressed, because methylation of ICT spreads to the promoter of H19 and silences its expression. Thus, Igf2 is expressed only on paternal allele, and not on maternal allele, i.e. it is maternally imprinted.</p>
<p>In Beckwith Widemann syndrome, <strong>maternal allele is methylated, i.e. it behaves like paternal allele</strong>, and none allele is imprinted. The resulting <strong>overexpression of Igf2 leads to tumor growth</strong>, since Igf2 is an oncogene promoting growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the “two-tier” hypothetical mechanism suggested by Csoka and Szyf (2009),  <strong>exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters</strong>. This stimulation results in the altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. <strong>With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure</strong>,<strong> leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network</strong>. Therefore, any epigenetic side effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued.</p>
<p>Sensitive (to epigenetic control) periods are the <strong>periods in development when epigenetic marks are actively remodeled</strong> (i.e. removed and/or laid down), and hence environmental changes or drugs may have the most dramatic effect on epigenetic outcome. In mammals development, there are <strong>two major sensitive periods</strong>: 1) the period from primordial cell development to production of mature eggs and sperm, and 2) pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. <strong>Treating patients during sensitive periods may alter the normal process of resetting epigenetic marks,</strong> and therefore it would be inadvisable.</p></div>
