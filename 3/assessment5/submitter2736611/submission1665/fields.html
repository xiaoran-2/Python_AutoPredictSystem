    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation and most CpG islands retain unmethylated status. Unmethylated CpG islands can activate the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Methylation at CpG island silence expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, methylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes is enhanced. CpG islands methylation can silence tumour suppressor genes and cause tumour. For example CpG island hypermethylation for RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 gene in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 gene in breast cancer, and MGMT gene in gliomas and colorectal tumours. Sets of hypermethylated CpG islands can differ by tumour type.</p>
<p>Gene in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.  Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity and stability. DNA methylation in intergenic regions can silence a cryptic promoter or a cryptic splice site. Non-methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements for example in a condition of lack of DNA methytransferase-1 in a cell can lead to gene deletions, insertions, duplications of whole chromosomes, as well as translocations between chromosomes. Activation of a cryptic promoter can interfere normal gene transcription.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements contain CpG dinucleotides and are very strong promoters. If the promoter were active, they can make a copy of themselves and paste themselves into somewhere else in the genome. Activation of repetitive elements can also lead transcription of downstream neighboring genes. Repetitive elements contains also cryptic promoter leading out the other direction transcription. Methylation in repetitive elements silence the all these transcriptions. Methylation of the repetitive elements can also prevent illegitimate recombination.  </p>
<p>In cancer, the intergenic interals and their repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation in the intergenic interals and their repetitive elements lead to genomic instability in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. That means it is paternally imprinted. H19 - a long noncoding RNA is produced just from the maternal allele. When imprint control region is unmethylated as a maternal allele, it is bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Igf2 will not be expressed. When imprint control region is methylated as a paternal allele, it blocks CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, which silence the expression of H19. Enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene and can promote growth. When there are mutations or deletions within imprint control region, or DNA methylation at ICR of maternal alle, both alleles can behave like the paternal allele. Igf2 genes can be over expressed and are related to wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methytransferase inhibitor. It hypomethylates DNA. The structure of decitabine is very similar to 5-azacytidine, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. So the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent. It is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. Epigenetic therapies can effect changes that stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods of epigenetic programming are periods when epigenetic markers go through dramatically change. There are two sensitive periods including the period from primordial germ cells to mature gametes and the period of preimplantation and early post implantation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs are going to be used throughout the system and cell could have a potential to be effected by these drugs. Taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery during the sensitive periods will also change epigenetic markers of normal cell and will become a very large insult to normal development process. Treating patients during sensitive periods like young people or pregnant women should be inadvisable.</p></div>
