    <h1>Submission 1633 from Anon (session_user_id: f5bb08be2f68a1e80c9dec6b648f43f62c3dd266)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a epigenetic drug which act as DNA-demethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analogue, specifically a cytidine analog, which is incorporated into DNA as the cell goes through division; and then irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferases. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase action, Decitabine could avoid CpG island hypermethylation. This DNA methylation could lead to silence tumour suppressor genes, which stop, among other things, the uncontrolled cell growth seen in cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated, and the enhancers act on Igf2, as H19 is methylated as well, and Igf2 gene is expressed. However, on the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and bind CTCF, therefore enhancers act on H19, instead of acting on Igf2, so in normal conditions, we don't have expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, we find methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele which leads to an expression of Igf2 from that allele. This disruption in the H19/Igf2 imprinting has a result a Igf2 expression from both alleles, so we have an overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 plays an important role regulating cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can have an effect over time because DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark and it is mitotically heritable, because in every cell division, this DNA methylation will be copied by DNMT1 onto the new daughters strands of DNA. A sensitive period is when we found epigenetic reprogramming, that means removing of the epigenetic marks, i. e. when the DNA methylation is removed. These sensitive periods are two: during early development and during primordial germ cells development. Therefore,during sensitive periods treating patients would be inadvisable, as the changes in DNA methylation could be inherited and the effects on germ cells need to be considered. So, it wouldn't be advisable for younger patients. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal conditions, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation and usually are found in the promoters of genes. When a CpG island is methylated means silencing of gene expression. What can be seen in cancer is the CpG island are more likely to be methylated, this disruption of DNA methylation at the CpG lead to a gene silencing. In that case, tumour suppressor genes have been silenced and this is leading to the uncontrolled cell growth seen in cancer. </p>
<p>In normal conditions, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, as they are not needed for gene expression. In cancer, there is a swap in terms of methylation, and these regions are found unmethylated on cancer cells. These hypomethylation on the repetitive elements could lead to genomic inestability and if it is found in CpG poor promoters could lead to oncogene activation.</p></div>
