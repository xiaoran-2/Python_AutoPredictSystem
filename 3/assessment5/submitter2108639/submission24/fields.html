    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><span style="font-size:14px;">The CpG islands are normally hypo methylated in comparison to the general DNA methylation of the genome of a healthy individual. If CpG islands, often situated in the promoter region of a gene, are methylated then one may consider it a purposeful silencing of a gene; but not perse a morbid condition.</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> </span></p>
<p>However Cancerous development generally hyper methylate’s the CpG islands,  while the general DNA methylation of the genomes of the healthy cells is lessens in time. Such a methylation blocks f.e. tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in apoptosis or it deregulates transcription control of cell proliferation through its effect in the promoter region. These epigenetic marks are mitotically retained in the fast dividing cancer cells. An increased chance for epigenetic ‘hits’ promotes a homozygotic deleterious effect.  The chance of a genetic mutation is less than a epigenetic mutation. The contribution of wrong methylation in cancer development is therefore strong.<span style="font-size:14px;"> </span></p>
<p>The intergenic regions are contrarily hypermethylated in the healthy cells as are the repetitive elements in order to suppress f.e. transposition of the last elements into gene regions and affecting the normal functioning of such genes.<span style="font-size:14px;"> </span></p>
<p>In the cancer status these repetitive elements as well as the intergenic regions are progressively demethylated; making them active and enhancing the morbid condition.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An important aspect of cancer is the loss of imprinting. The parent-of origin specific gene expressing is erased due to a change in methylation status of the ICR regions. Th proper dosage of gene expression for a healthy balance will be disturbed.</p>
<p>The ICR region of H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally methylated. The insulator CTFC cannot bind itself to the methylated ICR region. The downstream enhancers are now able to act on Igf2.</p>
<p>The maternal ICR region of H19/Igf2 is unmethylated. The insulator CTFC can now bind itself to the ICR region and the enhancers will be able to activate Hg19 but the Igf2 will remain silenced.</p>
<p>In case of hypermethylation of the ICR region of H19/Igf2 as in Wilms’s tumour: a juveline kidney cancer we will also see methylation the maternal ICR and the Igf2 of this homolog will be expressed. The consequence is an increased dose of Igf2 what causes the Wilms’s tumor.</p>
<p>So loss of imprinting changes the methylated status of the ICR region (both alleles are now methylated) contributes to the development of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>It limits the activity of the DNMT’s and avoids therefore hypermethylating of genes involved in tumor cell suppressing, control of proliferation and apoptosis; all important in the prevention and/or cure of cancer. Of course it has also a hypomethylating effect in the intergenic and repetitive regions of the chromosomes provoking enhanced chances of genome instabilities and transpositions.</p>
<p>It reverses hypermethylation induced gene silencing of tumor suppressors; one of the main causes of cancer developments. Where genetic mutations are permanent, epigenetic mutations are reversible. Small molecule inhibitors as decitabine are able to reverse the hypermethylation by trapping DNMT</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once a change in DNA methylation pattern is established it will mitotically be inherited by the daughter cells; and even by the granddaughter cells. The restored expression of the tumor suppressor en apoptosis controlling genes in the next generation cell will remain intact. Newly mutated cells will be more active destroyed will the help of their proteins. It will be less likely that resistance to a chemotherapeutic agent develops. Improved control of proliferation of cancer cell because of the more healthy methylation patterns will further beneficial effects in a treatment.</p>
<p>In epigenetic sensitive periods one should not administer these DNA  demethylating or histone deacetylating medicaments.</p>
<p>In the early embryonic stage: the pre-implantation period and in the primordial germ cell development, the predominant sensitive periods one should avoid these drugs. </p>
<p>Disturbed methylations patterns provoke either lethal consequences or development disturbances. Imprinting as well as epigenetic reprogramming will be strongly affected by a chemical changed methylation environment. Lethal embryonic consequences or development disturbances will follow.</p></div>
