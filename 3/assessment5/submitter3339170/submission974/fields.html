    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The normal function of DNA methylatigon at CpG islands is to inactivate gene expression. In cancer, DNA methylation is altered; generally higher levels of DNA methylation is observed and areas not generally methylated are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer can lead to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes which allows the cancer cells in an uncontrolled manner. Similarly, hypomethylation of CpG islands can result in the increased expression of genes, such as oncogenes; again, leading to uncontrolled growth of the cancer cells. Alterations in DNA methylation in cancer is not limited to the CpG islands. <span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells is known to maintain genomic stability (i.e sit can be involved in inactivation of maternal or paternal chromosomes). In cancer, genomic instability increases as <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the DNA of the cancer cell progressively become hypomethylated. Loss of DNA methylation at repeats and intergenic regions leads to genetic instability; deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes can occur leading to alterations in gene expression in affected cancer cells.. If these genomic abnormailities lead to increased expression of growth promoting genes or decreased expression of tumour suppressors, <span>uncontrolled growth in the cancer cells is further promoted.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained during mitosis and therefore is passed on to any daughter cells following cell division. This would mean that altered DNA methylation of the epigenome would be passed on to daughter cells arising from cell division and, hence, would be enduring. A sensitive period is a period when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e. when epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished during development). Sensitive periods of development are pre- and post-implantation (i.e. fertilised egg to the blastocyst) and during primordial germ cell development (I.e. Sperm and oocyte production or development). Treatment of patients with drugs affecting DNA methylation during these sensitive periods would be unadvisable as it would disrupt the imprinting process, affecting the re-establishment of epigenetic marks.  This could lead to abnormal development and/ or imprinting disorders, such as cancer or Beckwith-wiedermann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The paternal allele of the H19/IGF2 cluster is normally hypermethylated at its ICR region, which inhibits the expression of H19 and allows the expression of enhancers that lead to the expression of IGF2. On the  other hand, the </span>maternal allele of the H19/IGF2 is not normally methylated at the ICR region, which allows the transcription of H19,which indirectly inhibits the expression of IGF2 by disrupting the action off its enhancers. In Wilm's tumours, this ICR that controls the transcription of H19 is hypermethylated at both the maternal and paternal alleles. This disruption of imprinting leads to the silencing of both H19 alleles and this leads to increased expression of the growth promoting gene, IGF2, and uncontrolled growth in the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit the action of DNA methyl transferases (DNMT inhibitors). Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA in a dividing cell and binds irreversibly to DNMTs when these epigenetic factors bind to decitabine containg DNA. This irreversible binding means that  DNMT1 cannot copy the methylation mark of. Parent strand to the daughter strand of DNA during cell division. DNMT inhibitors such as decitabine, therefore, decrease DNA methylation in daughter cells. By decreasing DNA methylation, decitabine could alter the expressions of genes responsible for the uncontrolled growth of the tumour. For example removal of DNA methylation might lead to the reexpression of silenced tumour suppressor genes and restore normal growth control in the affected cell.</p></div>
