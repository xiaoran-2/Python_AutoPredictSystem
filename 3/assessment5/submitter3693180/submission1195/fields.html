    <h1>Submission 1195 from Anon (session_user_id: c57b2bc0e508363373b00c7715db6eb0afde96b8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodyplastic syndrome,  the precursors of myelogenous leukaemia.  It belongs to the nucleoside DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (deoxyribose analogue of 5-azacytinide), acting as a demethylating agent that is incorporated into DNA strands. </p>
<p>DNA methylation requires the enzymatic activity of DNA 5-cytosine methyltransferase proteins.  Decitabine reduces total 5-methylcytosine and reactivates imprinted genes. </p>
<p>Decitabine induces genom-wide hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which play a crucial role in the development of nearly all types of cancer,  as it not only silences tumour-suppressor genes but also results in activation of genes (I.e. R-RAS).</p>
<p>Hypomethylating agents can have an anti-tumour effect as they have the potential to reverse DNMT and increase the expression of silenced genes and therfore can lead to cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process by which individual alleles of certain genes are differentially expressed in agreement with their parent-of-origin.  Both maternal and paternal alleles are present, but only one is expressed whereas the other remains silent. The role of imprinted genes  is the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Allmost all of imprinted genes are found in clusters (I.e. IGf2, H19). The two major mechanism that are involved in establishing the imprint are DNA methylation and histone modification. </p>
<p>A disruption of imprinting results in developmental disorders,  predisposes cells to cancer and has been featured prominently in tumour development. </p>
<p>In normal cells,  the paternal IGf2 and the maternal H19 are expressed.  On the paternal allele H19 are methylated and IGf2 are unmethylated whereas on the maternal allel H19 are unmethylated and IGf2 are methylated.  The function of H19 is to turn off IGf2 expression,  a loss of H19 expression results in an overexpression of IGf2 leading to diseases. </p>
<p>In tumours with loss of imprinting,  I.e. Wilm's tumour,  a massive overexpression of IGf2 and a reduced expression of H19 can be found. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are strongly altered in all types of cancer.DNA methylation plays a key role in cancer as it not only silences genes but also lead to activation of genes. Epigenetic changes are inherited during cell division and are passed on to the daughter cells which result in permanent maintenance of the cell life. Once erased they won't return and can therefor have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Human development from conception to adulthood is extremely complex,  a huge number of processes must be coordinated to avoid diseases and maintain health.  Development proceeds from the formation of germ cells through fertilization,  embryonic and fetal development,  infancy,  early childhood and adolescence. These are sensitive periods and refer to a limited period in development during which an organism is more receptive to specific types of stimuli (I.e. the sensitive period for developing binocular vision lies between the 3rd and 8th month of age). Damages may occur and manifests itself immediately, later in life or in the offspring. </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods has been also associated with development of diseases and cancer in the offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism which regulates gene expression by both altering and suppressing the expression of genes. It is essential for normal development and has a key role in genomic imprinting, X-inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements and carcinogenesis. It plays a role in genome stability indicating that reduced DNA methylation leads to increased genomic instability. </p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation occurs at CpG sites, but CpG islands remain unmethylated - they are protected from methylation. CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites.</p>
<p>In tumour cells, the level of DNA methylation at CpG sites is low (means hypomethylated) which has been implicated in the development and progression of cancer, while CpG islands become excessively hypermethylated which can cause tumours by shutting off tumour-suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The presence of a methylated CpG predisposes that region to mutation because of deanimation and failure in repair.</p>
<p>The other regions of genoms where DNA methylation can be found are the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity,  in repetitive elements the function is to protect the genome from transposable elements by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition. Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. </p>
<p>In normal cells the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are usually methylated, whereas in cancer cells both are unmethylated.</p>
<p>Disruption leads to genomic instability, o</p>
<p>ncogene activation, transcriptional failure and transposition.</p></div>
