    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important for the normal function of the cell. The alteration of DNA methylation contribute to cancer development.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands silences the gene expression, being commonly presented in the promoter gene. In normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated. Due to that, genes are expressed, whereas in cancer cells this regions shows methylation, with the consequence of gene silencing. Typically, the genes that are silenced are tumour suppressor genes and, as their name says, they are expressed to prevent tumour proliferation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important to maintain the genomic integrity. That is, avoiding transpositions and illegitimate recombinations that would cause genome instability. In cancer, both, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, are hypomethylated, which causes genomic instability or activation of promoters which are generally inactive, like oncogenes ones. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The loss or increase of imprinting, that means, the methylation or unmethylation of the imprint control in both alleles causes the expression or silencing of the gene from both alleles.</p>
<p>We will see one example, the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is paternally imprinted. That means that the imprint control region is methylated in the paternal allele. Due to that, CTCF cannot bind to the insulator element and the enhancers acts on IGF2, activating it. The maternal allele is unmethylated in this region and the CTCF bind to it, so the enhancers act on H19, which silences the Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, both alleles are methylated, which makes that both acts as the paternal ones, with the overexpression of Igf2, which is an oncogene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. That means that is a drug that binds DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), interrupting the DNA methylation process. This can have an anti-tumour effect because generally tumour suppressor genes are active, but in cancer, CpG islands presents in tumour suppressor promoters are methylated, silencing them and producing tumour proliferation. With the use of Decitabine, CpG islands methylation can be inhibited with the consequent expression of the tumour suppressor gene and the anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation affect to epigenetic regulators that have their function on the DNA methylation epigenetic modification, which is very important for the imprinted genes.</p>
<p>The alteration of this enzymes inhibing them makes that these epigenetic modifications cannot be fixed, and this is important for the development.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the moment where the epigenetic marks are reorganized.  There are two sensitive periods: in the spermatogenesis and oogenesis and in the early development, before the formation of the blastocyst.  </p>
<p>During these periods it would be inadvisable to treat patients because these epigenetic marks are necessary for the development of the organism and without them the viability is at risk.</p></div>
