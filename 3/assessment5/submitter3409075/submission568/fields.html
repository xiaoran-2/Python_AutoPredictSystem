    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells there is hypomethylation at CpG islands while there is methylation in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated while the aforementioned regions that were normally methylated are now not methylated.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease by leading to insertions, deletions and reciprocola translocations, in general genomic instability.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements contain promoters and enhancers and possibly noncoding RNAs. </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetiitve elements contributes to disease by leading to genome-wide hypomethylation and tumour supperssor hypermethylation. Further, the role is context dependent. Some are driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then the depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis which is driven by chromosomal instability which depletes DNA mehtylation whihc enhances tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele allowing CTCF to bind the insulator which allows the enhancers to act on H19 which silences Igf2. On the paternal allele because this is methylated the enhancers work on Igf2 and CTCF is expressed. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated leading to a 'double dose' of of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gene. This is a common, early event often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>
<p>Disrupting such imprinting contributes to disease by leading to an increased quantity of Igf2. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold commercially as Dacogen, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of blood cell dysfunctions and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is a cytidine analog and functions as a hypomethylating agent. Its mechanism of action is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. This occurs by by exerting antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and incorporating itself into DNA which inhibits DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation and finally apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By altering DNA methylation it may become possible to effect the solid tumour as opposed to a leukaemia or a lymphoma, further, it appeared that even if initial weakening was not observed, weakness was seen during rounds of chemotherapy indicating that the tumour mass was impacted by altered DNA methylation. It was hypothesized in the paper that the cells were altered so that the epigenetic changes were passed on during cell division until they could be actively erased therefore removing the need to attempt to kill all cells which is more difficult. Sensitive periods are periods when the environment can have an effect on epigentic control and can have transgenerational consequences. These sensitive periods include: primordial germ cell development to gamete production and the pre implantation and early implantation periods. Treating someone during these periods is inadvisable because there is active reprogramming of epigentic marks which could result in irreversible alterations to the epigenome and possible transgenerational consequences. </p></div>
