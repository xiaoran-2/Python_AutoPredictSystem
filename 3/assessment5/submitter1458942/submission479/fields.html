    <div class="field-value"><p>The <strong>normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong> is related to silencing of gene expression and is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer:</strong> In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become <strong>hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</strong> for example tumor suppressor genes.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease:</strong></p>
<p>By hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes leads to silencing-controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. DNA methylation include a genome wide loss &amp; a regional gain of DNA methylation, which causes genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specific &amp; imprinted genes. In some cancers directed hypo-methylation at satellite repeats was detected e.g. malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.</p>
<p><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are:</strong>is to maintain genomic integrity. – silencing of repeats to prevent transposition– mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition –   silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination</p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer</strong></p>
<p>Repetitive DNA elements, such as short and long interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs and LINEs, respectively) and simple repeat sequences, are often found <strong>hypomethylated</strong> in cancer (Reference Ehrlich M (2002) DNA methylation in cancer: too much, but also too little. <em>Oncogene</em>). Although it seems clear that methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressor genes can be an important event in tumorigenesis, the magnitude, exact sequence specificity, and biological significance of tumor-associated DNA-hypomethylation is much less understood (Reference: PNAS,(2008) Rauch T A., <em>et al</em>, High-resolution mapping of DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation in lung cancer). </p>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>More consistently than genetic mutations,Hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats, contributes to genomic instability which leads to disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the mechanism is the insulator model of imprinting, which is employed by the H19/Igf2 imprinted locus. The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally- expressed Igf2 share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator which is located between the genes. <strong>Insulator and ncRNA mediated imprinting</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can now access Igf2 to activate.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </strong></p>
<p><span>On the maternal allele, CTCF to 4 binding sites with in the ICR, generating and insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enchancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator acts as an enhancer blocker. The ncRNA Airn represses Igf2.</span></p>
<p><strong>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour</strong></p>
<p> caused by deletion or inappropriate silencing of the paternal copy of 15q11-13,  no expression  </p>
<p><strong>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease</strong></p>
<p>Associated with misexpression of genes within specific imprinted clusters.  Genetic (deletion, mutation, uniparental disomy).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span><strong>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to</strong>. </span></span>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. </p>
<p><strong>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</strong>It hypomethylates DNA by<strong> inhibiting </strong>the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. </p>
<p><span><strong>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect:</strong> Decitabine or <strong>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</strong>, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  <strong>Decitabine drug inhibits the enzyme </strong>DNA- methyltransferase overactivity, </span>DNA methyltransferase overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silencing the genes they surround which include tumor-suppressor genes whose function is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
<p><span><span>The anti-tumor effect is by inhibiting silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome: </strong>Dr. Stephen Baylin research group at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore showed that <strong>combination</strong> of a <strong>histone-deacetylase inhibitor</strong> and <strong>azacitidine a histone demethylating</strong> agent slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. 1) It was for the first time epigenetic drugs showed good effect against solid tumor, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumors are harder to treat, because its hard for the drug to penetrate them). 2) It showed some good respose to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs given to the cancer patients next. Dr. Baylin speculate that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells is some lasting way that made them more suscepitable to standard chemotherapy. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be the epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p><strong>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods of development are: Early embryo development, Premordial germ cell development &amp; germ cell development.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable it will lead to disrupted epigenetic reprogramming or epigenetic abnormalities.</span></strong></p></div>
