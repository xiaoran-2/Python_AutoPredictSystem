    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation (DM) is one of the most amazing processes of the cell regulation. It occurs at CpG islands, which is a Methyl group will add to the 5'-C of cytosine. DM regulates gene expression (gene repression by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to access gene), <span>X chromosome inactivation, <span>chromatin structure, </span>the formation of heterochromatin</span> and sometimes are inheritable.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>DM pattern is unique from tissue to tissue, time by time. Global hypomethylation is a sight of cancer. Nevertheless, promoter hypermethylation also indicate that cancer and many diseases development can happen. Ex: DNA methylation is a biomarker for cardiovascular disease risk.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>DNA methylation in intergenic regions (IR) &amp; repetitive elements (RE) are maintain genomic integrity and RE are also a genome defense model.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In cancer, IR &amp; RE are hypomethylation, let to the whole genome instability. In other hand, silencing or mutaion occur in RE will prevent transposition and prevent transcription. It all takes part in the cancer and disease development.</div>
<div> </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted gene can found numerous in the brain and placenta. And we all know that imprinted genes exist in clusters and the truth is each cluster have one imprint control regions (ICRs). So, imprinting is the parental allele-specific exression of a very limited set of genes.</p>
<p>For example, the loss of imprinting of IGF2/H19 genes is a common cause of many human cancer. H19 is produced from maternal allele but it has no function of imprinting. In case of patternal allele, DNA methylation which is lock CTCF binding spread to H19, it enhances IGF2 expression. When maternal allele behave like paternal, it leds to BWS, the level of IGF2 is increase causes the overgrowth, tumour happen.  </p>
<p>When the imprinting is loss, it means that the methylation patterns is no more exists, can be a hyper-activation of normal silenced allele or hypo-activation (inactivation) of the normal active allele. It contribuetes to disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an analog to cytidine, because of<span> irreversible</span> inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase it is called a "hypomethylating agent". Some cancer, such as AML, some hypermethylated genes are correlated with the gene "auto-repair". They are commonly tumour suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, FHIT, p16 INK4A,...). So, when decitabine de-methylate these genes, it let to a tumour destruction.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics mediated changes is important in many cell processes. The change of DNA methylation pattern turns out the changes of transcription level, affect to the stability of the whole genome and epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is defined as a general properties to some certain stimuli or interactions of environment &amp; subject. </p>
<p>A sensitive period of develoment is a collection of all things that happen widely and have common fundamentals in the childhood (6-7 yo) or initial stage of development, especially to certain types of stimuli or interactions.</p>
<p>In the sensitive periods of cancer development. They will always have some standard kinds of predestined proliferation, such as the DNA methylation pattern is stable and it can program genes. Obviously, epigenetic drugs won't work. If we try to use it and delay the standard regimens, it is not good for patients.</p></div>
