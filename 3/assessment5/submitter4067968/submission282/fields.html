    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression and genome stability. Alteration of the normal DNA methylation patterns may contribute to the development of tumors. Two general alterations may be found in cancer cells: hypermethylation of CpG islands and global hypomethylation in the genome.</span></p>
<p><span>CpG islands, particularly found at gene promoters, are usually hypomethylated not depending on the activity of that promoter. However, in cancer cells CpG islands have a tendency to be hypermethylated. This results in the silencing of genes under the control of those promoters. The silencing of promoters regulating tumor suppressor genes will contribute to the development of cancer. Indeed, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is often more frequent than genetic mutations. Different tumor types may show hypermethylation of different CpG islands but, interestingly, some features are maintained within a particular cancer type and also between different cancer types. This, together with the relatively easiness to detect DNA methylation in the lab, has promoted the evaluation of DNA hypermethylation as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease and the election of the corresponding treatment.</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are globally methylated in the genome. Methylation of these sequences keeps them silenced, contributes to their compact chromatin organization and in turn maintains genome stability. In cancer cells, methylation is commonly lost at repetitive elements and intergenic regions and this may result in a number of processes, such as ectopic recombination between repeats which are not longer heterochromatinized and the activation of transposable elements. Altogether the loss of methyl marks in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes genome instability which in turn may cause other alterations and contribute to the development of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted genes show a parent-of origin monoallelic expression, which is controlled epigenetically by DNA methylation. When this regulation is lost, the two alleles could be either active or inactive simultaneously. These alterations are often related to cancer because imprinted genes are usually related to growth.</span></p>
<p><span>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the H19 gene is maternally expressed and the Igf2 is paternally expressed. In the maternal copy, the absence of methylation in a regulatory region allows the binding of the CTCF protein. When CTCF is bound, the enhancers located downstream cannot reach Igf2 but yes H19, promoting its expression. In the paternal copy, the regulatory region is methylated, CTCF cannot bind the regulatory region and hence the enhancers act on Igf2 preferentially.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumor, the regulatory region of this cluster is hypermethylated in both the maternal and the paternal allele. Thus, CTCF cannot bind in the regulatory region of the maternal copy provoking the maternal expression of Igf2. This person will have therefore two active copies of the growing factor Igf2 and this is associated with the development of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug. It causes a loss of methyl marks in the DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (therefore it is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, DNMTi). </span></p>
<p>These drugs are nucleoside analogues. When present, they will be incorporated into the DNA during replication. After that, DNA methyltransferases bind to this product but in an irreversible way so that the molecule is no longer free in the cell. Without the DNA methyltransferase activity the number of methyl groups will dilute each replication round. As cancer cells are dividing faster than normal cells, they will be more severely affected by this drug.</p>
<p><span>This drug is approved to use in patients with Myelodysplastic syndrome as it works really well and the side-effects are not very severe. One reason for this may be that this syndrome is associated with heavy hypermethylation of CpG islands and so Decitabine may have an anti-tumor effect by reducing the methylation level at these regions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic modifications are by definition ‘heritable changes in the genomic information without altering the DNA sequence’. Although controversy exists for some of the modifications, DNA methylation is doubtless transmitted across cell divisions. Therefore, changes in DNA methylation induced by a drug can be maintained after the treatment, and alter the effectiveness of subsequent treatments.</span></p>
<p><span>DNA methylation is erased and re-established in two periods of development (so-called epigenetic reprogramming): in the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period in the embryo, and later from the origin of primordial germ cells till the formation of mature gametes. These periods of epigenetic reprogramming are considered sensitive periods, because DNA methylation patterns are removed and established again and any mistakes or alterations produced by a drug will be transmitted to the individual or even to the progeny of this individual by alteration of the primordial germ cells. For this reason, treating patients with drugs that alter the epigenome would be inadvisable during sensitive periods due to the possible -yet unknown- long-term consequences that these modifications could produce.</span></p></div>
