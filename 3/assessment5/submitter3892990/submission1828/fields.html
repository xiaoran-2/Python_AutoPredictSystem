    <div class="field-value"><p>The expression of genes is controlled by many  mechanisms. One epigenetic control is the state of methylation of CpG islands. These genomic regions, when hypermethylated, can inhibit gene expression. Inversely, when hypomethylated, may indicate gene expression. The mechanism of action is by direct inhibition of transcription when hypermethylated, and modification of histone and nucleosome activity.</p>
<p>Though the mechanism is not yet entirely clear, increased CpG island hypermethylation has been associated with cancer. A confounding factor is that CpG island hypermethylation is known to increase with age.</p>
<p>In the context of cancer, CpG island hypermethylation can be understood as inhibiting the action of genes or groups of genes in a malignant cell line; considering that such DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. For example, CpG island hypermethylation, inhibiting expression of a tumour suppressor gene may function as one of the ‘hits’ required for malignant transformation. Indeed, there are specific examples of cancer phenotypes caused by CpG hypermethylation abnormalities at particular genomic regions, such as colorectal CIMP tumours.</p>
<p>Throughout the normal genome, intergenic regions, and particularly repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic stability by reducing transcription of these regions.</p>
<p>Tumorgenicity is associated with genome-wide hypomethylation. In repetitive elements and intergenic regions, this hypomethylation can lead to abnormal activation.</p>
<p>Activation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, leads to its malignant phenotypic effects via genomic instability, such as recombination between repeats, genomic translocations activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. These processes can lead to dysregulation of key cellular pathways, function, and malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster, like many growth regulatory genes is an imprinted allele. In the paternally inherited allele, in a normal cell, the expression of Igf2 (a growth factor) is controlled by enhancers which are expressed <em>in cis</em> (ie on the same chromosome).</p>
<p>On the (imprinted) maternally inherited allele, the expression of the enhancers is inhibited by the expression of H19, which is upstream from the enhancers. Thus the expression of Igf2 is inhibited on the maternal allele by the expression of H19. Considering again the paternal allele, H19 is inhibited by DNA methylation allowing the expression of enhancers and, in turn, Igf2. Thus, the presence or absence of methylation at H19 acts as an ‘imprint control region’ (ICR). In this case, methylation at the H19 ICR leads to Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Methylation at the same ICR, on the maternal allele, has been recognised in Wilm’s tumour. In this scenario, both ICRs are methylated leading to expression of Igf2 from both alleles.</p>
<p>This leads to ‘overdosage’ of Igf2 and dysregulation of the growth pathways controlled by Igf2 in the diseased cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) is an enzyme that is essential for regulating the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation of the genome. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.</p>
<p>As a DNMT inhibitor, Decitabine will prevent the methylation of replicated DNA, thus ‘diluting’ the methylation of the genome with each episode of mitosis.</p>
<p>Because an increased rate of cell division in malignant cells, a DNMT inhibitor can preferentially effect the malignant cell lines over normal cells. Its effects may be understood by dysregulation of the epigenome leading to cell death. Additionally, it may have an action by reversing the CpG hypermethylation seen in cancers.</p>
<p>The effect of using a DNMT inhibitor is variable, and will be dependent on the context of the malignancy, and other factors such as dosage and patient age. It is currently used in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who have converted to an acute myeloid leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic marker that is mitotically heritable. As a result, changes in the DNA methylation of a cell which divides may be inherited by all the cells ‘downstream’. This is usually functional, leading to normal differentiation of cells and tissues, but may also occur abnormally in certain diseases, such as cancer.</p>
<p>In the lifespan of a human, there are two periods of development, when the epigenome is ‘reset’; firstly, in all cells during pre-implantation of the embryo, and secondly in germ cells. These represent ‘sensitive periods’ where disruption of epigenetic mechanisms and machinery can have lasting effects on the cell lines affected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The effects of disturbing epigenetic mechanisms during ‘sensitive periods’ has been demonstrated in studies, such as depleting methyl donors in agouti yellow mice. In humans, epidemiological studies of the Dutch famine and Overkalix, Sweden have demonstrated epigenetic changes. Such evidence suggests that even subtle alterations of the epigenetic machinery during these ‘sensitive periods’ can lead to permanent changes in phenotype, which predisposes to disease states. With this evidence, purposefully disrupting epigenetic mechanisms during ‘sensitive periods’, for therapeutic gain, seems highly likely to cause unintended side effects and disease.</p></div>
