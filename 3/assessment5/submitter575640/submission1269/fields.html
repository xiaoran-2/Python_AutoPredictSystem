    <h1>Submission 1269 from Anon (session_user_id: 6eb0f79336efe182af864ff9840a1419f08e022a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         In cancer there is a tendency of specific CpG islands (different in different types of cancer) to be hypermethylated on their cytosines. CpG islands are often positioned at the promoters of genes and their hypermethylation usually results in silenced genes. If for example some tumour suppressor gene would be silenced in this way then the probability of developing cancer cell would increase.</p>
<p>        Decitabine is a drug that belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. This means that it promotes removal of methylation marks present on cytosines in DNA molecules. As a result it could reverse hypermethylation at tumour suppressor promoters which would unblock their expression and so slow or even stop the cancer from progressing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the hallmarks of cancer is loss of imprinting. For example lets take the H19/Igf2 locus. Between the Igf2 and H19 there is an Imprint Control Region (ICR) which is bound by <span>a transcriptional repressor CTCF in the maternal allele. This blocks enhancers, localized downstream of H19, from activating Igf2. Instead they have access only to the promoter of the H19 gene. CTCF acts in this way as an insulator of the enhaner-Igf2 promoter interaction. In contrast, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated which prohibits CTCF from binding. Moreover, methylation spreads to the H19 promoter which now cannot be activated by enhancers. In this situation the enhancers induce expression only on the Igf2 promoter. If now we would disrupt this monoallelic expression e.g. by  maternal ICR hypermethylation as is in the case of Wilm's tumour, we would end up with about twice as much Igf2 than needed. This could lead to excess growth and ultimately to cancer progression as Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands tend to be unmethylated independent of the expression status of the gene but in cancer we observe hypermethylation of CpG islands at specific gene promoters. This generally results in silencing of these particular genes. If one of them happens to be a tumour suppressor gene that decreases cell proliferation or either allows or makes the cell more susceptible to apoptosis then the probability of cancer progression would increase.                      </p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be hypomethylated in cancer. Normally these are methylated which allow the maintenance of genomic integrity. This comes about by many mechanisms including silencing of transposons which have strong promoters in the form of long terminal repeats, decreasing the probability of deletions, insertions and translocations, silencing spurious promoters situated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements so as to avoid transcriptional interference and by compaction of chromatin around repetitive elements which prevents unwanted recombination between repeats on different chromosomes. Consequently, having hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements as in cancer, leads to genomic instability and further exacerbates cancer progression.</p></div>
