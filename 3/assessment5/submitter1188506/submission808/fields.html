    <h1>Submission 808 from Anon (session_user_id: 09f6e79e3a992df4d9edd21825fc765870b15047)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltranferase inhibitor. It works by inhibiting DNMT1. It may be used to treat certain types of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that are precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). One of the hallmarks of of cancer is locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes as well as imprint control regions (ICRs). MDS is characterized by frequent epigenetic abnormalities, including the hypermethylation of genes that control proliferation, adhesion, and other characteristic features of this leukemia. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is associated with a poor prognosis in MDS that can be accounted for by more rapid progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine as a DNA methylation inhibitor may help prevent hypermethylation of key genes in this disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes to DNA methylation are passed on mitotically to daughter cells.  They are erased during early embryonic development and germ cell development. The period when epigenetic marks are removed is known as a sensitive period. In order for the epigenetic drugs to work the methylation marks need to be passed on from one cell generation to next. If the treatment occurs  during the sensitive periods of early embryonic development their effects may not last through the patient's lifetime. Active remodelling of epigenetic marks may also occur during differentiation rendering this period sensitive as well. However not much is known about this mechanism of removal of epigenetic marks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are associated with gene promoters and are normally unmethylated resulting in gene expression. In cancer cells, however, the CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to gene silencing. This may cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Methylation of cytosine in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or it can prohibit transcription factor binding and therefore alter gene expression. DNA methylation is thought to be an alternative to genetic mutation in cancer. It is also recognized to be one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis that states that cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. CpG island shores are 2kb regions surrounding the CpG islands that tend to be hypermethylated in certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>Repetitive regions and and intergenic regions are usually methylated in normal cells. Intergenic methylation is present in highly expressed genes and is thought to inhibit alternative transcription start sites, antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. Silencing of repeats by methylation contributes to genomic stability by preventing transposition, preventing illegitimate recombination and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Cancer cells are found to be generally hypomethylated the consequence of which depends on the location of the hypomethylation. In repeats and intergenic intervals, hypomethylation results in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters leading to disruption of neighboring genes all of which result in genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 and Kcnq1 loci  are on human chromosome 11. The H19/Igf2 locus consists of Igf2 gene, the imprint control region (ICR) and H19 lncRNA, upstream of an enhancer region. An insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the imprint control region and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This enables expression of H19 lncRNA which is associated with miRNAs as well as Igf2 silencing. This is what happens due to the unmethylated ICR in maternal alleles. DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF to the ICR which allows methylation to spread to H19 promoter thus silencing its expression. The enhancers are then free to bind to the preferred Igf2 promoter to activate its expression. This is the scenario for the methylated and therefore imprinted paternal allele.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICR of Igf2/H19 and its neighboring Kcnq1 clusters leads to loss of expression of Cdkn1c tumor suppressor gene and upregulation of Igf2 oncogene that happens in Wilm's tumor. </p>
<p>Other ways in which imprinting could be disrupted in this locus is by mutation or deletion in a critical region of the DNA or by uniparental disomy in which two copies of the one parental chromosome is inherited.</p></div>
