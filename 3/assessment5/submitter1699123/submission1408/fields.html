    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Imprinting Control Region is methylated in the paternal alelle, and unmethylated in the maternal one. The unmethylated maternal ICR binds CGCF, an insulator (zinc finger protein), which allows H19 expression but insulates  Igf2 from the downstream promotors, reducing Igf2 transcription. In the imprinted paternal allele, the methylated ICR prevents binding of CGCF, and the methylation suppresses H19's promotor in cis. This allows the enhancers to access the Igf2 gene, increasing the transcription of Insulin-like growth factor 2. In Wilm's tumor, imprinting of the maternal allele is lost, or there are two paternal alelles and no maternal one (uniparental disomy), eliminating dosage compensation of Igf2 (increasing the effective dose of Igf2). As a growth promoter, Igf2 will increase growth of any tissues with its' receptors, including the kidney. Wilm's tumor develops due to the elimination of repression of Igf2 overexpression. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is the result of loss of maternal imprinting at this locus, and results in overgrowth of the tongue, pancreas (manifested as severe neonatal hypoglycemia due to insulin overproduction), liver, and kidney. The organs that overgrow are vulnerable to cancers during early childhood when Igf2 expression is most active..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a  neucleoside analogue, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). DNMT is needed to establish methylation in a newly replicated strand of DNA. Since cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than most healthy cells, cancer daughter cells are more rapidly demethylated by these drugs than healthy cells. In cancers that are driven by epigenetic repression of tumor suppressor genes (DNA repair genes, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis promoters, etc), reducing DNA methylation restores these controls on cell growth and reproduction. As cancers become more dysplastic, their methylation increases. Reducing hypermethylation of the CpG island shores and CpG islands promoters allows the transcription of tumor suppressors and reduces the abnormal metabolism of the tumor cells.Complete loss of DNMT can kill cancer cells, causing tumor shrinkage. Even cancer cells that are not killed can be rendered more vulnerable to chemotherapy drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic marks that are passed down to daughter cells, so changing a cancer cell's abnormal methylation pattern will also pass down, hopefully lowering the grade (dysplasia) of the tumor. In healthy individuals, DNA methylation helps to ensure that gene products are produced in the right doses and at the right times, and is important in the differentiation of cells to form specialized tissues in multicelled organisms. Sensitive periods are when epigenetic imprinting is reset, or erased and later re-established. These sensitive periods occur during the period from fertilization to implanation, and again during formation of primordial germ cells. In humans, treating a woman around the time of conception, a pregnant woman during her fetus' primordial germ cell development, or a child or adolescent (when further development of the gametes occurs) could affect their health and the health of their offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, normal DNA methylation is inverted: there is a genome wide loss of methylation at intergene intervals, tandem repeats and imprint control centers, and a gain of methylation (hypermethylation) at CpG islands and CpG island shores, which contain the promoters of growth regulating, DNA repair, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and cell cycle control genes collectively termed tumor suppressor genes. Methylating the promotors of these growth regulating genes prevents them from being expressed.</p>
<p>Normal DNA methylation controls the expression of genes that are involved in differentiation, cancer cells act 'de-differentiated' or like stem cells, dividing rapidly. Normal DNA methylation of imprint control centers allows for dosage compensation by allowing only the gene from that maternal or paternal allele to be expressed. Increased or decreased dosage of a gene product can disrupt cell function or even epigenetic control if the gene product is a non-coding RNA or an epigenetic enzyme such as a histone deacetylase. The loss of repression at high risk areas causes chromosomal abnormalities: tandem repeats are vulnerable to translocations from illegitimate recombination, and intergenic intervals contain retroviruses and cryptic promoters that are normally suppressed by methylation. Loss of methylation of intergenic intervals allows oncogenes to be expressed or transcribed that are normally blocked.Generally the genetic instability that results from loss of DNA methylation at intergene intervals and repetitive elements makes tumor cells more and more genetically abnormal with each replication. The abnormal gene expression and chromosome constitution (along with abnormal histone modification, nuclear organization, and chromatin remodeling) make the tumor more and more dysplastic and dangerous as time passes.</p></div>
