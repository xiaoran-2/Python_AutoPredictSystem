    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In genome-wide  we may identify three regions related to methylation (epigenetic mark that usually leads to silencing in genes involved).<br />The first region to note is related to the CpG islands in the promoters often. These islands are normally free of methylation in normal cells, but cancer cells found hypermethylation silencing genes causing among which are tumor suppressor genes.<br />In contrast, in the other two regions related to methylation such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements, there is the opposite situation. Normal cells in these regions tend to be methylated in cancer cells change has occurred hypomethylation which may produce a change of euchromatin to heterochromatin leading to genomic instability may cause deletions, or insertions reciprocal translocations in genes affected.<br />This genomic instability is related to the cancer diseases and also with illegitimate recombination between repeats, and repeats the activation of transposition and also by activated cryptic promoters and gene disruption neighbors.<br />In summary, some of the causes of cancer are caused by genome-wide  hypomethylation and hypermethylation of CpG islands leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the maternal allele has no methylated ICR and this makes enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 not on. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and consequently act on Igf2 enhancers and not on H19.<br />Wilms' tumor is caused by a loss of imprinting, and the maternal allele, like the parental passes also express the Igf2 promoting growth Wilm's tumor associated.<br />Other cases of loss of imprinting, are associated with a wide range of tumors and preneoplastic tissue</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine acts as a DNA-demethylating agent inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) avoiding aberrant methylation or hypermethylation, especially the tumor suppressor genes preventing its silencing.<br />Used in myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is one in which different factors can influence the epigenetic machinery.<br />Sensitive periods of development in mammals are firstly, the period of primordial germ cells for the production of mature ovules and sperm. The second period is the time to pre implantation and early implantation.<br />Somatic cells are also sensitive periods of change throughout his life, transferring these to the daughter cells and so on.<br />The influence of different factors on these sensitive periods is due, among other causes, to an alteration in DNA methylation at both somatic and germ level.<br />These influences can lead to lasting changes causing epigenome active remodeling and long-term action.</p></div>
