    <h1>Submission 260 from Anon (session_user_id: ddbffaba042b826be9a3a0e29a52c0f396e3b3b3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand-daughter cells, until they are actively erased. This process is known as transgenerational  epigenetic inheritance through the gametes. </p>
<p>However, there are some development periods in which these drugs can't be used: they are called sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a time when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods that can be identified: the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms, and the pre-implanted and early post implantation period shown. In conclusion: germ cell development and early embryonic development. </p>
<p>The uses of these kind of drugs during these periods is inadvisable because any environmental change, like the drug's effect in the body, could be  transgenerationally heritable. The use of this drug during these periods can affect epigenetic reprogramming, so the changes passed on to the offspring for several generations to  come, as a consequence of transgenerational  epigenetic inheritance through the  gametes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the group of DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>The impact od this drug is that it inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Because it is a nucleoside analog, it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. </p>
<p>Because of this reason the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent, so the cell must be replicating. This means that cancer cells, which are dividing faster than other normal cells, will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-20ac9e055c76c39605ddcc1b/970238/asst-5/970238-52049ea5368c14.47216074.png" alt="" /><br /></strong>A normal CpG island is usually free of methylation and it's associated with gene silencing, if it's found at the promoters, and it also helps to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>The difference between normal cells and cancer cells is that in cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated.</p>
<p>This disruption of the DNA methylation can causes silencing of the underlaying genes. In addition, changes in DNA methylation include a genome wide lost and a regional gain of DNA methylation, so this can cause genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. It can also cause silencing of tumor supressor genes by hypermethylation of the CpG islands.</p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and the  repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells. These regions have some functions: they maintain genomic integrity, the can do some silencing  of expression and they can silence splice sites. In conclusion, they maintain genetic integrity and maintain genetic stability.</p>
<p>However, in a cancer cell this <span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted and it can cause deletions, insertions or even duplications of whole chromosomes and translocations between them. </span>In the case of cancer, these intergenic intervals and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. </p>
<p><span>The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to disease because it affects to g</span>enomic instability and it causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-20ac9e055c76c39605ddcc1b/970238/asst-5/970238-52049e99428c82.77451816.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The paternal allele has an active expression of Igf2 because of the methylation of the ICR. This situation allows the binding of the enhancers to the Igf2 and its expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele has an inactive expression of Igf2 because of the unmethylated ICR, which allows the expression of H19 (a long noncoding RNA). With an unmethylated control region the insulator protein CTCF can bind here and as a consequence the enhacers are not able to bind to Igf2. As a result, these enhancers can act on H19 and promote its expression.</p>
<p>The picture shows that in Wilm's tumour there is an hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele, so there is a Igf2 overexpression because the maternal allele acts like paternal allele, there is one extra dose of Igf2. </p>
<p>The disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can contribute to disease because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, which causes cancer if there is a double dose of it.</p>
