    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are located between the central region of the promoter and the start site of transcription and repression is observed in gene expression when they are hypermethylated. In normal cells, the CpG islands usually remain free of methylation independent of the activity state but cancer cells are found hypermethylated causing silencing underlying tumour suppressor genes and therefore is not possible stop the grown uncontrolled of cancer cells. In normal cells the intergenic regions, repetitive element (satellite, LINEs, SINEs) and retroviral insertions are methylated and silencing to maintain the DNA integrity but in cancer cells are hypomethylated and contribute to genomic instability due illegitimate recombination, activating of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, and activating repeats and transposition, causing abnormal karyotype with deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation of chromosomes.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and Igf2 genes form a cluster of reciprocal imprinting so that Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal chromosome and H19 is expressed only on the maternal chromosome in normal cells, where the regulation is performed by a factor called CTCF insulator, which binds to a region of differential methylation. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated therefore the H19 is not expressed and also this methylation prevents binding the CTCF allowing that the enhancers can act and Igf2 can be expressed. On the contrary, in the maternal allele ICR no is methylated therefore the H19 is expressed, the CTCF can bind and isolates the enhancers hence the Igf2 gene is not expressed.</p>
<p>Alterations in this pattern of methylation at ICRs, can result disease as Wilm’s tumour, having ICRs methylated in both alleles (maternal and paternal) causing Igf2 overexpression and loss of expression of H19. On the other hand if both alleles were no methylated the H19 gen will be overexpressed and also the loss of expression Igf2 could be unviable.     </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>EZH2 enzyme binds methyl groups from histones, contributing to silencing of genes. In cancer cells this enzyme is overactive and tumor suppressor genes are silenced unable to avoid the proliferation of tumors cells. As epigenetic alterations are reversible, nowadays for cancer treatment are investigating substances which inhibit the activity of this enzyme, including the Decitabine that is a DNA-demethylating agent, FDA approved, used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes in human. The substitution of the 5-methylcytosine for Decitabine (nucleoside analogues) produce an inactivation irreversible of DNA metiltransferasa. Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNMTs which although high dose are toxic however small dose are very effective in the inhibition of proliferation and survival of tumour cells, and is tested in many tumours including solid tumours.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Demethylating drugs could produce a "memory" antitumor response, so could stop cancer growth without killing all cells because the demethylation of DNA are preserved during cell division from one cell to the next.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are periods in which the cells acquire “memory epigenetic” that transmits stable alterations in genetic expression of a cell to their offspring. It implies that a stimulus that operates in this sensitive period of development can result in persistent or permanent effects on the structure or function of the body. These periods where can increase responses generational are: in grandmother in fetal development, infant life and 8-10 year, grandfather in pepubertal stage, 9-12 year. It is inadvisable treatment with these drugs in young patients during sensitive periods, because the secondary effects of these drugs will act in all the cell of system. Epigenetic therapies could affect the structure of chromatin, which may cause side effects ultimately to them and their descendants.</p></div>
