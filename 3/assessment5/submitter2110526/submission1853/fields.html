    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally kept unmethylated which allows the promoters containing these islands to function.  However, in cancer, these islands tend to become methylated, thus silencing the gene the promoter was to activate.  This loss of gene function leads to disease, especially if the gene that was silenced was a tumour-suppressor gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast intragenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to maintain genomic integrity.  In cancer, these regions can be hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability: there can be deletions, duplications, translocations, etc.  The mutations that will occur due to this are likely to cause disease.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the gene for producing a long noncoding RNA H19, shutting it off.  This RNA blocks an enhancer from acting on Igf2, so when it is shut off Igf2 can activate.  Thus Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.  On the other hand, there is no H19 methylation on the maternal allele, thus allowing H19 to shut off Igf2 expression on this allele.  If the maternal allele is also methylated, then imprinting is lost: both maternal and paternal alleles express Igf2.  This overexpression of Igf2 promotes overgrowth, which can lead to childhood tumors such as Wilm's tumour (and others).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. which removes methyl groups from locations on DNA.  DNA methylation is a principal epigenetic mechanism, which is passed on to following generations of cells; excessive or aberrant DNA methylation is a frequent derangement of the epigenome in cancer, so its removal can have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed on to subsequent generations of cells.  Thus, once the methylation of DNA is altered, the effects will be passed on to all cells which arise from those cells that experienced the treatment from the epigenetic drugs even if those drugs were no longer being given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are however periods when it would be wise to avoid treating patients with such drugs.  Those sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, so that treating patients during those periods would be likely to have far-ranging and undesired effects.  Clearly the period of primordial germ cell development to the production of mature gametes would be such a period, as would be the period just before to just after the implantation of a fertilized egg (early embryonic development), so one should avoid epigenetic-drug treatment of patients planning to become or originate pregnancy or who have just become pregnant.  Additionally there may be sensitive periods for particular organs.</p></div>
