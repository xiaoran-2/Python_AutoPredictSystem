    <div class="field-value"><p>The most frequent location of CpG Islands is in promoters of the genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoter of the gene suppress transcription of this gene, in other words makes this gene silenced. It was found that during development of cancer CpG islands in promoters of the tumour suppressor genes become methylated. This means that genes encoding tumour suppressors would be silenced. If the gene isn't expressed no corresponding protein could be generated, in this case, tumour suppressor. Without tumour suppressors cells carrying mutations resembling them immortal, metastasizing, independent of growth factors could survive. These survived cells will transform to tumour cells and therefore initiate the onset of tumour disease. Tumours in which sets of certain genes are hypermethylated at CpG islands have special phenotype - CIMP.  <br />In intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity. In intergenic regions DNA methylation suppress transcription at cryptic transcription start sites and spicing at cryptic splicing sites. DNA methylation of repetitive elements makes them silenced so they don't transpose and disrupt some (maybe very important) gene by insertion in its sequence. DNA methylation at transcription start sites of repetitive elements helps to avoid competition for transcription at strong promoters of nearby genes. Methylated repetitive elements also couldn't enter illegitimate recombination. In cancer at intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA hypomethylation is observed. This epigenetic aberration leads to genomic instability: at cryptic transcription start sites expression begins; transposition and illegitimate recombination become possible. In general, all normal functions of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements are reversed in cancer. Genomic instability leads to accumulation of errors. Some of them alter activity and regulation of tumour suppressor genes, some lead to conversion of protooncogenes to oncogenes. This results in transformation of damaged cells into tumour cells.<br />  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On maternal and paternal allele <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster consists of consequently arranged<em> Igf2</em> gene, imprinted control region (ICR), <em>H19</em> gene and located few kilobases downstream enhancers. On paternal allele ICR is methylated and methylation is propagated downstream to promoter of <em>H19</em> gene. This makes <em>H19</em> gene silenced and enhancer affect not <em>H19</em> gene but <em>Igf2</em> gene. So at paternal allele <em>Igf2</em> gene is expressed. On maternal allele ICR is not methylated so CTCF protein can bind it. CTCF works as insulator and don't let enhancers to affect <em>Igf2</em> gene. Therefore enhancers induce expression of <em>H19</em> gene on maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour hypermethylation of ICR is observed. This means that ICR at maternal allele is methylated and don't bind CTCF insulator. In other words maternal allele looks like paternal and <em>Igf2</em> gene is expressed. Transcription of Igf2 at paternal and maternal allele leads to overexpression of <em>Igf2 </em>gene. <em>Igf2</em> product (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) presented in excess could be considered as oncogene because of its growth promoting function. IGF2 is especially important during fetal development so its overexpression brings problems during gestation and as a child. That is why Wilm's tumour is a children disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (active substance 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidin) belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. Decitabine as modified nucleic base incorporates into DNA instead of cytidine. But unlike cytidine Decitabine couldn't be methylated by DNMT. Therefore Decitabine causes genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA in a cell division dependent manner. This drug could be helpful in diseases where CpG islands are heavily hypermethylated. CpG islands at promoters when hypomethylated are accociated with expression of corresponding genes. So tumour suppressor genes that were silenced because of hypermethylation of CpG islands at promoters could be expressed again. Generation of tumour suppressor genes products can lead to death of mutated tumour cells. Decitabine showed to be effective in myelodysplastic syndrome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most stable epigenetic marks. So once it established as the outcome of epigenetic reprogramming (periods of early embryonic development and generation of primordial germ cells) and differentiation into certain cell type it is maintained and mitotically inherited. But DNA methylation status can be changed during the live of the cell under exposure to epigenetic drugs. And after the removal of these drugs new DNA methylation status will be maintained and inherited by daughter cells. This may be the mechanism of enduring effects of epigenetic drugs. Sensitive period of development is the period when epigenetic reprogramming takes place in cells. Impact of epigenetic drugs during early embryonic development is possible only if treating pregnant woman with cancer. But it is very rare situation, if ever happens. So the main period when epigenetic therapy may be dangerous is the period of primordial germ cells maturation. It continues until puberty. This means that treating of children with epigenetic drugs in inadvisable. Otherwise these drugs can affect correct laying of epigenetic marks and lead to unexpected adverse effects.</p></div>
