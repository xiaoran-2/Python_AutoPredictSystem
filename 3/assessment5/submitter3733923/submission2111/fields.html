    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modification plays an essential role in normal cell development and can affect the development of cancer.  DNA methylation by the addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of the cytosine ring within the context of the CpG dinucleotide modifies the expression of genes without altering the DNA sequence.  It has been shown that DNA methylation occurs on approximately 70% of CpG residues, although the majority of the genome is CpG residue poor, there are specific clusters of CpGs, or CpG islands at the 5’-ends of genes. In normal cells, the majority of CpG islands are normally unmethylated, however, during the development of cancer become hypermethylated leading to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes whose promoters are associated with CpG islands. This has been proposed as are one of the hits in the Knudson “two-hit” models of tumor formation. DNA methylation in normal cells also occurs in the intergenic and repetitive elements, were it serves to regulate the expression of genes and maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic slice sites. Methylation of repetitive elements contributes to the silencing of repeats that prevent transposition and interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination and explains why in normal cells they are transcriptionally silent. Using genome wide sequencing technology it has been shown that repetitive elements are hypomethyated and this is associated with the transition of healthy cells to malignant disease.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, H19 contains a differentially methylated region (DMR) that is also an imprinting control region (ICR). Parental inheritance governs the methylation status of the ICR at its CpGs. Methylation at a DMR upstream of the <em>H19</em> gene at the ICR is acquired in the male germline and influences the methylation status of DMRs 100 kb away in the adjacent Insulin-like growth factor 2 (<em>Igf2)</em> gene. Hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele regulates the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2.  The paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. In Wilm’s tumor there is a loss of imprinting and the epigenetic status of the maternal chromosome switches to the epigenetic status of the paternal allele, such that the maternal allele has methylation of the H19 promoter and IGF2 is turned on and H19 is off, leading to increased cell growth and cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating drug or hypomethylating drug being used to treat myelodyspastic syndromes.  It works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. As aberrant methylation of CpG islands near tumour suppressor genes occurs in many cancers, this drug will de-methylate these hypermethylated regions allowing the expression of tumour suppressor genes with inhibition of cell growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Epigenetic modifications are passed on during cell division until they are erased, meaning that the effects can last longer than they would if you were targeting the primary cancerous cell as they continue to affect all cells for subsequent generations. The sensitive period refers to the time when epigenetic modifications are made to the genome. There are two main sensitive periods during development. The first is during the formation of the primordial germ cells, during in utero development. The second period is just after fertilization in the early zygote.  The critical remethylation period happens early in pregnancy, often before people are aware they are pregnant. Treating patients with DNA demethylating drugs during this period would prevent the critical remethylation necessary following the global demethylation following fertilization and would dramatically alter gene expression that would have deleterious effects on the offspring.</div>
