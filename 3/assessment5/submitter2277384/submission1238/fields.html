    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands (CGI, groups of CpGs commonly found in gene regulatory regions) are commonly unmethylated, whereas CGIs at gene promoters in cancer cells are hypermethylated which by-turn leads to gene silencing. And obviously, silencing tumor suppressor genes contributes to disease. Such abnormal hypermethylation is later inherited to daughter cells.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Intergenetic  regions and repetitive elements are methylated (hence, packed in heterochromatin) in normal cells – this is an instrument of maintaining genomic stability. This methylation ensures a cell won’t lose or gain chromosomes, have repeats recombined or transposed, deleted,  inserted or copied to the other places in genome. CpG poor promoters are methylated and corresponding genes are turned off.</p>
<p><br />In cancer cells intergenetic regions and repeats are unmethylated (hence, heterochromatin becomes unpacked) so all mutations mentioned above can happen and actually happening. Repeats can jump into coding region, causing its malfunction, or activate neighboring genes. Unmethylated CpG poor promoters activate their genes (for example, R-RAS gene). Shortly, genome become unstable, instability leads to more instability, tumor suppressor genes get mutated, oncogenes are activated. Chromosomes become unstable – and this is additional way of assisting tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, ICR of the cluster and the H19 promoter is methylated, CTCF does not bind to the paternal methylated ICR thus enhancers can access Igf2 gene leading to its expression. On the maternal allele ICR and the H19 promoter are not methylated, so enhancers act on H19 (but not on Igf2) leading to its expression. So we can say that for a normal cell Igf2 is paternally expressed.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If a cell loses its imprinting, both maternal and paternal alleles become paternal-like (Igf2 ON, ICR me, H19 OFF), so there is double Igf2 expression. This is exactly what happens in Wilm’s tumor cells. As Igf2 is a growth factor, its overtranscription contributes to the cell degeneration.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. Demethylating is achieved through inhibiting DNA methyltransferase  - Decitabine molecule is incorporated into DNA during replication and when DNMT binds to the molecule, it cannot be released anymore. This affects every cell, but cancer cells are the most vulnerable as they replicate fast. Maybe there are more mechanisms, but they are unknown for now. As it is said in Q1, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes’ promoters contributes to cancer greatly and drugs like Decitabine “cancel” such an abnormal methylation thus reactivating tumor suppressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As it is mentioned in Q1 and Q3, DNA (de)methylation contributes to fight against cancer. It is also inheritable – daughter cells acquire (almost) the same DNAme pattern, as their parent. In the context of fighting cancer it means long lasting positive epigenetic effects, but, in general, reasons against using such kind of drugs exist. Drugs like Decitabine do not distinguish cancer and normal cells and act on both of them. That is not an issue when we are talking about a normal patient.</p>
<p> But there are patients that are in their sensitive periods (the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development, the periods of development that is susceptible to environmental signals) – children (germ cell development is incomplete, the organism itself is vulnerable to epigenetic changes as discussed during Week 5), pregnant women at pre-implantation stage. Altering DNA methylation in the whole organism can alter epigenetic reprogramming resulting in a damage to germ cells in children (which possibly means infertility) and a serious threat to an embryo. So, using epigenetic drugs on the younger patients is inadvisable because long-term consequences of the organism-wide epi-alteration hit them much harder, than adult and elder patients.</p></div>
