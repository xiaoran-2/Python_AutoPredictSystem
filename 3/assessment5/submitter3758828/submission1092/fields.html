    <div class="field-value">Methylation of CpG islands causes silencing of genes. Methylation of genes has been shown to lead to mutations.  Additionally, often, genes that would suppress tumors are methylated, leading to cancer. Any change in the methylation of genes - specifically at CpG islands is likely to lead to some sort of disease, whether it be because genes are turned on that would not other wise be, or because they are silenced. It is believed that the function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to prevent anything potentially harmful being coded for. If intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not properly methylated, then these regions that are expected to not code for anything may actually end up coding for potentially dangerous diseases.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Igf2 requires the H19 gene to be inactivated (methylated). On the paternal allele, it is also reliant on the activity of DNA-methyltransferase. DNA methylation is not required on the paternal allele until after implantation. Wilm's tumor is linked to lack of imprinting of H19 and IGF2.   It is thought that perhaps H19 can function as a tumor-suppressing gene. When the H19 gene is hypermethylated, it is likely not expressed. With H19 is methylated, Igf2 is expressed. This contributes to disease in several ways, the main of which being that H19 is not expressed to suppress tumors. In general, disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer  in two ways. Either genes that were functioning as tumor suppressors are no longer, or genes that were not active become active and cause cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is a "hypomethylating agent". It works by hindering DNA methyltransferases (thereby hypomethylating the DNA). Though it may seem counterintuitive, Decitabine allows more genes to function. It actually allows naturally occurring tumor suppressing genes to function. Often, in cancer (and tumors), a large part of the problem is that tumor-suppressing genes are themselves, suppressed.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Methylation is imprinted - it carries from parent cell to daughter cell. This means that if the methylation of a cell is changed, all of the cells it produces will be methylated (or not, depending on the change). DNA is most susceptible to such changes during "sensitive periods", or periods of rapid growth and development, such as during the production of gametes, or when the embryo is first being formed. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during those periods because all of there cells would be more susceptible to epigenetic changes and all of the daughter cells would also be effected. </div>
