    <h1>Submission 1053 from Anon (session_user_id: 77e003ef498a40f667c93b1fa72282a073c893b4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and is approved by the FDA. It is used to treat de Myelodysplastic syndrome that progressed to acute myeloid leukemia and it is also currently in clinical trials for other malignancies.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporate into DNA upon replication, and when DNA methyltransferase (DNTM1) comes along to bind that nucleotide, copy the methyltransferase to the daughter strand and since it is bound irreversibly it can no longer be released. These mechanism of action is  division dependent so, cell replication is needed. It is based on that cancer cells are divided much more rapidly than normal cells, and consequently they get more Decitabine incorporated.</p>
<p>Decitabine only has anti-neoplastic effect, when it performs the DNA methyltransferase inhibition, and it does only happen at a very low doses since higher doses of these drug is toxic and does not have any specific effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is a swap in terms of DNA methylation patterns between normal and cancer cells. Normal cells are hypomethylated in CpG islands but the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes.</p>
<p>In contrast, cancer cells are more likely to be hypermethylated in the CpG islands and unmethylated in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions.</p>
<p>Starting from a normal tissue and progressing to a metastatic tissue, the global level of methylation decreases. But at the same time, methylation at the CpG islands becomes denser.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes and these are silent. DNA methylation is mitotically heritably so is a good mechanism of epigenetic silencing and also these epimutations are rapidly selected so cancer cells could be divided more rapidly or not die too much. Although DNA hypermethylation and consequently silence of tumour suppressor genes hits the DNA it is necessary many insults to the DNA in order to contribute to cancer cells.</p>
<p>But intergenic regions and repetitive elements make up most of the genome. And in cancer, these regions tend to be less methylated than normal cells. Genome-wide hypomethilation is a very common feature found in cancer and it happens early and progresses with time. </p>
<p>In the context of cancer hypomethylation of these repetitive elements leads chromatin to be more open, and permit them to align and misalign forming by this way illegitimate recombination because they are not densely package. Also, hypomethylation activates transpositions that lead to transcription aberration to the surrounding genes and cryptic promoters and disruption of the neighbour genes.  </p>
<p>Summing up the overall in cancer is general genomic instability through additional deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation, at imprinting control regions can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. The H19/Igf2 cluster is one example of hypermethylation at the imprint control region that leads to an overexpression of Igf2, a growth-promoting gene that leads to the development of the Wilms’ tumour.</p>
<p>In normal cells the imprint control region of H19/Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele permitting by this way the expression of Igf2. But it is unmethylated in the maternal allele silencing their expression. CTCF4 binds to the unmethylated region and enhances H19 causing the silence of Igf2. In contrast, in the cancer cells, the imprinting control region of the maternal allele is disrupted by methylation so, CTCF4 is not binding, and the Igf2 is expressed also for the maternal allele causing a double dose of Igf2, a growth promoting gene found overexpressed in Wilm’s tumour.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since the epigenetic changes are passed to the daughter cell during cell division until they are erased. And once erased, they do not return, so they can stop a cancer development without kill all the cells.</p>
<p>Early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic machinery. One of these sensitive periods is during the developing of germ cells.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable treating patients during sensitive periods since one very large insult to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits at the epigenetic machinery.</p>
<p>So, in young people (childhood cancers) when the sensitive period takes places, the use of drugs that alters epigenetic machinery has to be taken very carefully. So maybe, it would be better to try to use other types of drugs or standard chemotherapy until the sensitive period have been finished and the development have been completed. </p></div>
