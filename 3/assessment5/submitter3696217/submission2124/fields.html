    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. </span>CpG islands are found in about 60% of gene promoters and t</span><span>hey are usually kept free of methylation independent of their genes' activity state.</span></p>
<p><span>In <span>cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene (tumour supressor genes in cancer). CGI methylation progresses with time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The <span>hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands</span> causes <span>silencing of tumor suppressor genes (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair). <span>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumour type.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated, this maintains genomic integrity: silencing of repeats prevents transpositions, illegitimate recombinations, and so avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters. This </span></span></span></span>protects the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In cancer cells these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, that means they are less methylated than in normal cells. This occurs to some degree in all tumour types, and also progresses with time, with tumorigenicity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. That means there may be illegitimate recombinations between repeats (reciprocal translocations), deletions, insertions, activations of repeats and transpositions, or a</span></span></span></span></span>ctivation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. In this case ICR binds CTCF which is an insulator protein. This CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This way H19 will be activated by the enhancers.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it, and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour (childhood kidney disease) occures, when loss of imprinting on the maternal allele causes hypermethylation of the ICR. This way there will be Igf2 expression also on the maternal allele, which means double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p>
<p>A common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting by hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs). That means: genes that should be displaying monoallelic, parent-of-origin-specific expression (lots of them involved in growth control) are no longer imprinted, but they are expressed or silenced from both parental alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. It is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By the use of a DNA-demethylating agent t<span>he amount of histone overmethylation declines dramatically.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When histones are methylated more than they should be, they silence the genes they surround, including tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. So DNA-demethylating agents <span>also reduce the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is an epigenetic change, which<span> are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased - called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. One they are erased, they do not return. </span>Inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression patterns from parent to offspring (which are not explained by genetic differences) happens by passage of epigenetic marks through the germ cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks, rather than during maintenance of them. There are two major sensitive period: primordial germ cell development (until production of mature eggs and sperms), and  pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. These are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome (removal and laying down of epigenetic marks). (There are also other brief windows in time for tissue specific differentiation for each of the organs, which are sensitive for that given organ.)</p>
<p>These are critical periods of development and they are very sensitive for any alteration of the environment. That's why treating patients is not recommended during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
