    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation in the genome is, amongst others, to help the control of gene expression. DNA methylation, when found in promoter regions, often decreases gene expression. 60% of promoters in the human genome have regions rich in cytosine and guanine, called CpG islands. There is usually no DNA methylation in these regions, and it does not correlate with the activity of these promoters. However, cancer cells tend to hypermethylate CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and repetitive sequences is often decreased. This may contribute to disease by (1) decreasing the expression levels of DNA repair genes and tumor suppressor genes such as RB in retinoblastomas and BRCA1 in breast cancer; (2) increase expression of oncogenes, such as Myc and Ras; and (3) by decreasing genomic stability.</p>
<p>When found in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps promoting genomic stability and integrity by silencing repeats, preventing transcription interference, transpositions, and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, hypomethylation of intergenic regions/repeats leads to genomic instability, which is one of the several hallmarks of cancer. These insertions, deletions, chromosomal translocations and inversions may contribute to the cancer progression by increasing mutation rates that can lead to activation (gain of function mutations) of oncogenes and inactivation (loss of function) of tumor suppressor genes.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted domain present in the human chromosome 11. This cluster is controlled by an imprinting control region (ICR) that leads to the expression of <em>IGF2</em> from the paternal allele and <em>H19</em> from the maternal allele. This happens because the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated and this allows for the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, to the DNA. The presence of CTCF insulates <em>Igf2</em> gene from downstream enhancers and induces chromatin conformational changes so that the enhancers can act on <em>H19</em> locus. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind to it. In this case, the conformation of chromatin induces the enhancers to act on the Igf2 locus, increasing its expression.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumor, one can observe hypermethylation of ICRs. Hypermethylation of the ICR on the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to prevention of CTCF binding in the maternal allele and causes overexpression of <em>Igf2</em> and downregulation of <em>H19</em> expression, two genes that should have opposite effects on cell growth. Once <em>IGF2</em> expression is turned on, and <em>H19</em> is turned off, there is increased stimulus for cell growth, which contributes to cancer development.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as a DNA-demethylating agent and has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which can give rise to acute myelogenous leukemia. While some new drugs such as GSK2816126 inhibit histone methylation, Decitabine acts directly on the DNA to remove the methyl group from the cytosine base, therefore decreasing DNA methylation. Since we know that cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation of CpG islands and that this can decrease expression levels of different genes including tumor suppressor genes, Decitabine may have anti-tumor effects. By demethylating the DNA, this drug can reactivate the expression of tumor suppressor genes and hamper the proliferation of tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that change epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation have long lasting effects because these changes are mitotically heritable. Once a cell divides, the old DNA strand that bears a DNA methylation mark will serve as a template for methylation of the new complementary strand. The <em>de novo</em> methylation mark will be laid down by methylating enzymes such as DNMT1. This way, epigenetic changes may accompany a patient for its entire life. Because epigenetic drugs alter heritable epigenetic marks, it is not advisable to treat patients with these drugs during “sensitive periods”. These critical periods are the ones where we have epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and reset of epigenetic marks), such as during gametogenesis and early preimplantation development. Therefore, the use of epigenetic drugs during these periods is unwise once they can alter the epigenome of a developing embryo (in case drugs are taking by an unaware pregnant woman whose fetus may be in the preimplantation stage) and of the entire next generation coming from the patient (in case drugs are taken during gametogenesis). </p>
