    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is found at the cytosine residues of most CpG dinucleotides in the genome. However, regions of the DNA that have high density of CpGs, called CpG islands (CGIs), tend to have non-methylated cytosine nucleotides. DNA methylation correlates with tightly packed heterochromatin which represents regions of the genome that are not transcribed into RNA. Non-methylated regions are not always active due to the influence of other epigenetic marks (histone modifications). Many gene promoters contain CGIs which are hypomethylated in normal cells (e.g. tumour supressor genes). However, oncogene promoters tend to be poor in CpGs and they are frequently methylated silencing the genes they regulate. In the normal genome the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in order to keep the genomic integrity and stability. DNA methylation keeps these regions packed and unaccesible to RNA polymerase or transcription factors and also ensures chromosomal stability. Genome of the cancer cells tends to be widely hypomethylated especially in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This is related to a high genomic instability due to unpacking of the chromatin. This allows DNA fragments to jump as transposable elements and makes unregulated recombination events, translocations, insertions and deletions more likely. CGIs in cancer are generally hypermethylated as opposed to normal cells. Since they are found in many gene promoters this could lead to packing and silencing of genes that regulate cell proliferation (e.g. tumor supressor genes). CGI shores are also hypermethylated which contibutes to the gene silencing. Oncogenes tend to have CpG-poor promoters and because of the general hypomethylation in cancer they lack methyl groups and this makes oncogenes more likely to be transcribed. Silencing of tumor supressor genes along with activation of oncogenes can allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably transmitting these epigenetic abnormalities to the daughter cancer cells. DNA methylation in imprint control regions is also disrupted in cancer and since many genes involved in cell growth are imprinted this contributes to cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating drug which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). This drug prevents <em>de novo</em> DNA methylation and also the methylation of hemimethylated DNA double helices after replication (passive demethylation). Therefore decitabine is a substance that can reactivate previously inactived genes as it leads to undirect demethylation. The mechanism of action of decitabine is probably either as a false substrate for DNA synthesis as a cytosine analogue and subsequent DNMT inhibition or as a direct antagonist of DNMTs (or both). This suggest that decitabine can be used to treat cancer by its function as an agent that demethylates the DNA. It could be achieved by demethylation of CpG-rich promoters (e.g. those of tumor supressor genes) which are hypermethylated in cancer cells leading to tumor supressor genes reactivation. The side effects could be due to the fact that decitabine is not specific to attack the cancer cells and it can also inhibit DNMTs in normal cells and disrupt their epigenetics in the long term.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Functions of imprinted genes are frequently related to cell proliferation. Such an example is H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells the maternal allele has unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) in this cluster which allows CTCF factor to bind to ICR and insulate the Igf2 gene from being reached by transcriptional enhancers and leading to eventual silencing of Igf2 transcription. H19 lncRNA which is found near the ICR has unmethylated promoter and is being expressed from the maternal allele. The paternal allele on the other hand has a methylated ICR which methylation spreads and reaches the promoter of the H19 lncRNA. This silences the transcription of H19. Moreover the CTCF cannot bind to ICR due to its methylation and Igf2 is not insulated and thus easily reached by transcriptional enhancers. In summary, Igf2 is a growth factor that promotes cell proliferation and is expressed from paternal allele in normal cells. In Wilm's tumour, however, due to the disruption of epigenetics both alleles have methylated ICRs and therefore enhancers can reach and activate transcription of both Igf2 alleles thus promoting cell proliferation. In this case the cells have twice as more expression of Igf2 growth-promoting factor compared to the normal cells which promotes their uncontrolled growth and cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that act on the epigenetic machinery can have long-term effects since they alter the epigenetic marks which are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is such a mark that can be transmitted to the next generation via a known mechanism. DNA methyltransferase 1 recognises hemimethylated double helices and methylates the cytosine that lacks a methyl group. Thus DNA methylation is maintained for many cell generations. This means that a treatment with a drug that hypo- or hypermethylates the DNA can have long-term effects - ones that can be transmitted to the next cell generations even without further exposure to this substance. Drugs that alter the epigenetics are not a good choice in the so called sensitive periods. These are periods when an epigenetic reprogramming is observed. This means that epigenetic marks are erased and than reset again. Such periods are the development of the embryo prior to the implantation and the primordial germ cells development. An exposure to a drug that alter the epigenetics during pre-implantation development can lead to an epigenetic disruption that is later maintained in the somatic cells of the organism because of the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic marks. Moreover, if the primordial germ cells are exposed to such a drug epigenetic disruption effects could appear in the next generations.</p></div>
