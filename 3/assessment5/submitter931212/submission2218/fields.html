    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are essentially areas with a large number of CpG sites, and normally, they're rarely methylated. In cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated, drastically reducing the expression of tumor suppressors that would normally prevent the formation of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Considering that CpG islands are essentially a large cluster of promoters, methylating them silences certain genes. That silencing contributes to the formation of cells with different traits than the surrounding tissue, which in many cases may be enough to create problems, but assuming certain groups are suppressed, the resulting cells would be the starting point of diseases, or simply weakening the organizm contributing to their manifestation.</p>
<p>Normally, DNA methylation in intergenic areas ajnd repetitive elements is presumed to help maintain genetic integrity. A symptome of practically every strain of cancer discovered so far was a genome wide lack of methylation on these two areas.</p>
<p>The contribution of the lack of normal methylation is the fact that unlike the methylation of promoters, within the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation keeps certain behaviours in check (transposition, repeats, illegitimate recombinations, etc.)</p>
<p>Lack of methylation on the other hand means that there's nothing stopping those from occuring and the resulting synthesis of proteins and cell division will not produce normal results which will in turn affect the health of the organism if the scale of it is sufficient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>In some cases, during carcenogenesis, certain genes that help suppress the formation of tumor are methlyated, thus inhibitting thier function. Given how cell division works, the methylation transfers from generation to generation, remaining there due to methyltransferases that copy them and possibly make new methylations.</p>
<p>By inhibitting the methyltransferases, the drug can, generation by generation, reduce the number of malignant cells by eliminating the abberant methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is because of how DNA methylation works; if you target a number of cells and affect their methlyation, the change can and will propagate itself to the next generation. Unless foreign influences change the methylation again, the effects will remain until the strain of cells stops dividing.</p>
<p>A sensitive period here is a state in development when there is a greater amount of epigenetic activity, such as during early human development.</p>
<p>My assumption is that any stage in which the human body undergoes major changes or major trauma would render it sensitive. Starting from the fertilization of the egg cell to about the second year of life (a crucial formative period for humans), pregnancy, post operative recovery(transplantations perhaps especially), recovery from any major injury or illness.</p>
<p>The notion is that affecting the epigenetics during sensitive periods may interrupt the natural course of development, as well as cause difficult to predict consequences.</p></div>
