    <div class="field-value"><p>two type of DNA abnormality  occures,hepermethylation which is locus specific, and  hypomethylation of DNA, which is genome-wide.In normal cell the CpG island are hypomethylated, but in repeatative element and inter region we see the hypermethylation, but in contrast in the cancer cell the CpG island are hypermethylated and the rest of genome such as repeatitive elements and inter region are hypomethylated.And as we know the normal role of DNA methylation is inhibite of some gene to be expresse and genomic stability.If we have disruption in of DNA methylation at CpG island causes silencing or activating of unfavoured gened in a specific organ or growth and development stage which lead to an abnormality.Since in repeat we have genetic identity it causes recombination, which mostly is not good to have healthy organ ot tissue etc. so they should be hypermethylated and heterochromatinized to inhibit of this event,but sometimes because of a lot of reasons these repeat elements and intergenic undergo hypomethylation which leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats and cause  diseases and cancer.in other hand by the hypomethylation the repeats may be activated and make copy of themselves and transpose through the genome or may be also activate the neighbouring genes with strong promoters.the overall outcome is the additional  deletion or insertion of genes or reciprocal recombination in cancer.Based on hypothesises cancer results of some hits which DNA hypermethylation that causes silencing tomour supression genes in cancer is also one of this hits.Additionally hypermethylation at CpG island is provided,which can spread in neighbouring cell that can silencing tumour supression gene at these regionmwhich leads to cancer or diseases.Tumor suppressor genes are often silenced in cancer cells due to hypermethylation. In contrast, the genomes of cancer cells have been shown to be hypomethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>one of the common feature is loos of imprinting in cancer cells.a lot of genes are imprinted are involved in growth,growth promoting or growth supression.In the case of H19/lgf2,imprint control region on patternal allele is methylated and unmethylated on maternal allele.In the maternal pattern the CTCF element binds to imprinting region and then enhncer act on H19 but Igf2 would be silenced,but in paternal pattern because the ICR is methylated enhancers act on Igf2 and this gene would be expressed.In Wilm"s tumour the ICR in matternal pattern is hypermethylated which leads to act the enhancer on Igf2 and it would be expressed,so it seen double dose of Igf2. In other casese hyper or hypomethylation may leads to tumourgenesis and diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belonges to DNA-demethylating agents group,which causes hypomethylation DNA by  inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.As we know DNA methylation is a critical event in the silencing of unfavoured gene expression and causes genomic stability.It seems that this drug can inhibit DNA methyltransferases and reverse epigenetic silencing of aberrantly methylated genes.Such demethylating agents have been proposed to reactivate tumor suppressor genes aberrantly methylated in tumor cells, leading to inhibition of tumor growth.gene promoter methylation provides a physical blockage of the DNA binding site for transcription factors,so reducing or lack of DNMT enzyme at CpG island resulted in hypomethylation at these regions,by this one this drug can have anti-tumour effect.this drug is nuceloside analogus which bind irreversibly DNMTs after they are corporated into DNA,and also pass through daughter cells,conciderably should use in low dosage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>sensitive period is a term refer to important periods of human development whic the cells are more susceptible to new microenvironmet of cell and any outer agent.Generally there are tow most important sensitive periods in developmet which are primordial germ cell and early development stage.specific events during each of this developmental stages may creat sensitivity to environmental influences.Damage from environmental exposures may occur and manifest itself immediately or may not appear until subsequent stages of development or after development is complete.The combination of genetic material from sperm and egg provide a unique genetic blueprint for each child.Environmental toxicants that harm germ cells can affect an adult's own fertility as well as the health of the offspring.so use such a epigenetic drug eventhought in low dosage may be toxic to new cell environment,and cause disorder in epigenome which also pass trought offspring by mitotically inheritence that affect their healthy in adulthood so use of them is inadvisable in sensitive period.The simplest conceivable mechanism for maintenance depends on semiconservative copying of the parental-strand methylation pattern onto the progeny DNA strand so it have enduring effect in whole epigenome.</p></div>
