    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer both by the hypermethylation of gene promoters and other areas, and by the hypomethylation of intergenic regions such as repeats.</p>
<p>CpG islands primarily occur in or near the promoters of genes. In normal cells CpG islands are generally hypomethylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, especially in the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes. This inhibits the activity of the suppressers, allowing unrestricted cell growth. Because this hypermethylation can be mitotically inherited, this abnormal methylation pattern can spread quickly through cell reproduction, resulting in cancer. For example, cancerous blood cells may outcompete and crowd out normal blood cells, or cancerous cells may develop a solid tumor that impinges on normal tissues. Unrestricted growth can also lead to metastasis or the spread of cancer throughout the body.</p>
<p>In contrast, to CpG islands, in normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which make up most of the genome, are methylated into heterochromatin. This helps maintain genomic stability by restricting the activity of these regions, some of which are remnants of retroviruses. A characteristic of cancer cells is widespread de-methylation or hypomethylation of these regions, allowing them to become active. Activity of repeats can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats that can reciprocal translocations between genes. It can also result in gene deletions, insertions, and translocations. These changes can cause a wide range of disruptions to the cell function, depending on which genes are changed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The link between Wilm’s tumor and the H19/Igf2 cluster, which ordinarily exhibits monoallelic parental expression, and Wilm’s tumor is one example of how disruptions in epigenetic imprinting can contribute to disease. The Igf2 intron codes for insulin-like growth factor 2, which has insulin-like properties and regulates growth during embryonic development. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) for Igf2 is hypomethylated, allowing binding by the insulator protein CTCF, which blocks expression of the Igf2 intron by insulating it from downstream enhancers; instead the enhancers express H19. The ICR of the paternal allele is hypermethylated, blocking CTCF binding. This hypermethylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing H19, and allowing the enhancers to express Ifg2 from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>This imprinting pattern is disrupted when the ICR is hypermethylated on the material allele. This cases the maternal allele to produce Igf2, as well as the paternal allele, giving the developing child a double dose of this growth factor. The excessive amount of growth factors is associated with Wilm’s tumor, a rare cancer of the kidney’s that typically develops in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug FDA-approved drug for a type of blood cancer, myelodysplasticsyndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. It is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. It isa nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases, preventing these enzymes from adding methyl groups to DNA and so interfering with the copying of methylation from mother to daughter cells. Therefore, its therapeutic effect is replication dependent. </p>
<p>Inhibiting DNA methylation can slow the progress of these blood cancers, which are characterized by heavy CpG island methylation. Interfering with the copying of this abnormal methylation to daughter cells interferes with the production of new cancer cells, perhaps by “unlocking” genes that regulate cell growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine affects all cells, not just cancer cells. However, because cancer cells replicate much more quickly than non-cancerous cells, cancer cells should be more heavily impacted, depending on the dose administered.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Epigenetic drugs may have impacts beyond the period of drug therapy because altering methylation can have enduring impacts on the epigenome by inhibiting or halting the reproduction of epigenetic marks from mother to daughter cells. If these daughter cells are not re-methylated, the loss of methylation will continue in surviving cells, causing the drug to have impacts beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>Because drugs such as Decitabine do not target only cancer cells, treating patients during sensitive periods of development may not be advisable. These sensitive periods include times when changes in epigenetic marks, such as removal and establishment of parental imprinting, are crucial to development. Disrupting the establishment of these marks may impact the development of a young patient, their ability to have children, or the health of their children.  The sensitive periods are: the development of germ cells prior to fertilization; egg fertilization and the division of cells prior to implantation; the development of blastocyst when random x-inactivation takes place, as well as epigenetic marks associated with the development of different types of tissues; and development of primordial germ cells and the development and production of mature germ cells, which continues throughout adolescence in women.</p></div>
