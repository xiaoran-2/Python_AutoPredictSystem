    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is the result of either activation of oncogene or silencing of  tumor suppressor genes. In genetics mutation control the function of gene but in epigenetic DNA methylation, histone modification control activation and inactivation of genes. In geneome the site of methylations are mostly CpG island and some intergenic regions. The CpG islansd are found in promoter region of a gene and are hypomethylated but when get methylated this leads silencing of corresponding gene. The X chromosome inactivation, genome imprinting, genome stability and  formation of heterochromatin are the result of methylation of CpG island. In cancerous cell CpG island of promoters of many tumor suppressor gens are hypermethylated that result in silencing of  associated genes. The tumor suppressor genes are involve in control of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair so the silencing of these genes may lead abnormal growth pattern as shown  cancerous cell.Frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites is termed as CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). CIMP was first reported in colorectal cancer and later in glioma and breast cancer, it  helps in study of disease by many clinicopthological  parameters such as  age, gender  of patient, location of tumor microsatellite. The intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated in highly expressing gene of normal cell and reduce transcriptional noise due to alternative start sites and inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. Methylated  intergenic regions maintain genomic integrity. Methylated repeat element prevents transposition of repeat elements and prevents illegitimate recombination of repeats. In cancer cell the intergenic and repetitive element get hypomethylated that result to genetic instability of genome by insertion and deletion of genes and jumping of transposons, it  contribute in cancer. In case of ICF syndrome in which hypermethylated repeat region get hypomethylated due to mutation  in DNMT3B and result into genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is the property of cancerous cell. The imprinted genes are involve in growth either by growth promoting or by growth suppressing  so hyper and hypomethylation of imprinted control region regulate the expression of gene. In H19/Igf2 cluster when ICR is methylated in paternal allele this  prevent binding of CTCF to its binding site in ICR so that enhancer located  to the down stream of H19 get interacted with Igf2 and  results the expression of Igf2. The promoter of H19 need to methylated for its silencing. In case of maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and allow binding of CTCF to its 4 binding site on ICR that generate an insulator and prevent the interaction of Igf2 with the enhancer located at down stream of the H19 this result the expression of H19 only, So H19 is expressed in case maternal allele and Igf2 in case of paternal allele . In Wilm’s tumor it is observed that there is hyper methylation of ICR in maternal allele that result the expression of Igf2 in maternal allele also. Igf2 is growth promoting factor so the double dose of Igf2 leads abnormal growth behaviour that characteristic of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic mark are erasable so it is possible to rectifying the abnormalities caused by epigenetic enzymes. So there many drugs have been developed that targeting epigenetic machinery. Decitabine belong to class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors and inhibit the function DNMT1 that require for maintaining of methylation mark on genome during replication. it is nucleoside analogs and  get incorporated into DNA during replication of genome at time of cell division. In replication when DNA methyl transferase comes in contact with decitabine it binds with DNMT1 as irreversible binding. That result in unequal distribution of methylation mark in daughter cell,so the daughter cell become hypomethylated  after generations. The action of decitabine is division dependent so tumor cell are more affected by treatments than normal cell. It happens due to tumor cells dividing and replicating fast than normal cell so tumor cells genome are preferable site of action for decitabine .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic mark  can pass from parents to daughter by mitotic heritability so once they established during reprogramming are maintained generation after generation until they are not erased. So when the combination drugs are used for targeting epigenetic machinery for the treatment of cancer the epigenetic marks are erased from cancerous cell that results the daughter cell will be hypomethylated so the alternation in epigenome maintain the effect of  for long time beyond the treatment. the period of epigenetic reprogramming is called sensitive period. This  is the period of early development and development of Primordial germ cell and gametes. The drugs used in treatment of cancer are acting on epigentetic machinery so if these drugs are given to any patient  in sensitive period it might be possible that some important epigenetic mark are erased and that may affect normal functioning of cell.</p></div>
