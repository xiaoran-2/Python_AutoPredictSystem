    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cellular processes such as differentiation are regulated by the activation of a subset of genes as well as the downregulation or silencing of other genes, DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to block expression of certain genes, in particularly important situations such as imprinting and X-inactivation. During cancer, CpG islands are overly methylated (hypermethylated) such that genes which normally function to control cell proliferation, (ie tumor suppresors) are now silenced and cannot act to combat the changes in cell cycle and growth. It is important to note that many of the genes in our genome are resolved from alternative promoters, and methylation of DNA in intergenic regions would prevent the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II to another transcriptional start site. In addition, methylation of repetitive elements also serves to block effects of transposons to lead to increased genomic stability, so the transposons may be more active.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code">Decitabine would serve as a promising epigenetic target for cancer treatment as it is an analog of the nucleoside cytidine, and serves as a hypomethylatting or DNA-demethylating agent. Resembling cytidine, it can be incorporated into DNA during replication. Decitabine is recognized as a substrate candidate for methylation by DNA methyltransferases, but instead of being methylated, it traps the DNMTs covalently and leads to their degradation. (Lyko and Brown, 2005<span>, DNA Methyltransferases and the Development of Epigenetic Therapies, </span><span>JNCI) </span>Diminishing the pools of available DNMTs would cause a decrease in methylation at CpG islands around promoters, with the goal of restoring gene expression of vital tumor suppressors necessary for the anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the hallmarks of an epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation is that it is retained in subsequent daughter cell populations until actively removed or altered. <span style="font-size:14px;">However, it is also appreciated, as emphasized by Derbyshire (We are what our mums ate) that times in early development, the fetus and young children can be susceptible to a variety of changes in their epigenetic marks that has been to correlate with diseases later in life, and even into future generations.  Thus, expecting mothers and young pediatric patients with such cancers may not be good candidates for such treatments. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting can play a large role in cancer, as demonstrated by the H19/Igf2 locus. In normal conditions, the paternal allele, Igf2 expression occurs because of a failture to recruit the insulator CTCF to the ICR (as the site is methylated) between the downstream enhancers and the upstream Igf2 gene, with the subsequent effect of blocking H19 via promoter methylation. The maternal allele normally allows for insulation of the Igf2 oncogene by binding of the insulator CTCF to an unmethyled ICR blocking the expression of Igf2 from that allele but instead allows the enhancers to now drive H19 expression. In contrast, during loss of imprinting, the maternal allele which normally suppresses Igf2 reverts to a similar status as the paternal allele. Instead of having only one allele activating Igf2, both alleles downregulate H19 and express excess Igf2. As igf2, by definition is an insulin-like growth factor, it functions in an oncogenic manner to facilitate cell growth with a tumor as a result. </p></div>
