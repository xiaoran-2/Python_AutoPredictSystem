    <div class="field-value"><p>        In a normal cell, DNA methylation -- addition of a methyl group to a cytosine in a cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) -- is associated with silencing, primarily because methylated CpGs bind MeCP proteins, which bring in factors that condense chromatin, making it inaccessible for transcription. </p>
<p>        In normal cells, CpG islands -- stretches of DNA with a high concentration of CpGs -- that occur in many gene promoters are not methylated.  In cancer, CpG islands in gene promoters become more methylated than normal (hypermethylated), so genes are silenced abnormally.  When this occurs in tumor suppressor genes, cells can grow and proliferate abnormally, contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>        In normal cells, repetitive elements, which are typically transposable elements or their remnants, have most CpGs methylated, so they are silenced.  This prevents transposons from jumping around the genome. Transposable elements can also have strong promoters at both ends, which can inappropriately activate genes downstream from them; silencing from methylation prevents this. The presence of repetitive elements containing the same repeated sequence in non-homologous chromosomes could allow reciprocal translocations between chromosomes, since these can occur where there is sequence identity, but methylation causes chromatin compaction of these regions so translocations can't occur. CpGs in intergenic regions are also normally methylated; this prevents abnormal activation of genes by cryptic promoters in these regions, and abnormal RNA splicing if the DNA machinery associated with splice sites occurs in these regions.</p>
<p>        In cancer, repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated (less methylation than normal).  As a result, oncogenes can be abnormally activated by strong promoters in transposons or cryptic promoters. The mutagenic effects of transposon activity can lead to deletions and insertions, and lack of silencing of repetitive elements can allow reciprocal translocations, so overall, hypomethylation of these areas leads to the genomic instability that is a hallmark of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>        A normal imprinted locus has different methylation of its imprint control region (ICR) between the maternal and paternal alleles: one is methylated, the other isn't. If this is disrupted so that either both or neither of the ICRs are methylated, imprinted alleles are either overexpresed or underexpressed. Since these are often either oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, this can contribute to cancer.  For example, in a normal cell,  the ICR of the paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. Methylation prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR, so enhancers downstream in the DNA sequence are not blocked from binding to Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed.  Normally, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, so CTCF binds to it, blocking the enhancers from binding to Igf2, so Igf2 is not expressed.  In Wilm's tumour, imprinting of the maternal allele is disrupted, so the maternal ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind, and Igf2 is expressed from the maternal as well as the paternal allele.  Igf2 is an oncogene, promoting growth, so the overexpression that occurs when it is expressed from both alleles leads to excessive cell growth, contributing to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>           Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  It has a chemical structure similar to cytosine, so when DNA is replicated, Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA in place of cytosine.  The enzyme Dnmt1 normally methylates the hemi-methylated DNA at CpGs after replication, but when Decitibine is present instead of cytosine, Dnmt1 binds to it irreversibly, so methylation is stopped.  As a result, methylation is lost with each replication. Since cancer cells replicate rapidly, this decreases DNA methylation in cancer cells much more than in normal cells. </p>
<p>        Demethylation through Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect if the tumor is developing because of methylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters; demethylation will allow the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed and stop tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      DNA methylation is inherited mitotically because of the action of the enzyme DNMT1.  When DNA is replicated, it is initially hemimethylated (the original strand is methylated, the new strand is not.)  DNMT1 recognizes hemimethylated DNA and methylates the new strand.  So if a drug alters the DNA methylation state, the new state will be passed on through mitotic divisions after the drug is no longer being used; this could make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy</p>
<p>        Use of drugs that alter the epigenome could lead to serious impacts on the next generation if used during sensitive periods: times during development many epigenetic marks are removed and new marks are laid down. Two major major sensitive phases occur in the primordial germ cells, and after fertilization, in early embryonic development. DNA methylation laid down at this time is critical for normal development, so drugs affecting methylation would in inadvisable for pregnant women early in pregnancy, when the early embryonic epigenetic reprogramming is occurring, through mid-gestation, when the embryo's primordial germ cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming.  Also, pre-pubertal boys and girls may be undergoing significant maturation of germ cells, and use of the drugs then could affect their offspring. </p></div>
