    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered methylated epigenetic marks in cancer are characterized by genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation of locus specific tumor suppressing promoter regions such as CpG islands and CpG shores.  CpG islands are unmethylated in healthy cells allowing activation of tumor suppressing genes and methylated in cancerous cells suppressing activation of suppressor regions. In intergenic and repeat sequences, healthy cells are methylated packing the chromatin more densely and thus suppressing genomic instability as manifested by recombination between repeats which may result in reciprocal translocations, insertions, deletions, disruption of neighboring genes (Avy, Axin fu) and activation of cryptic promoters. In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repeats are unmethylated thus contributing to transcriptional aberation and genomic instability which is a hallmark of many cancers. There is an inversion of marks between healthy cells and cancer cells.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation, which is mitotically heritable and reversible, increases with age and varies with tumor type,i.e., one tumor has one set of epigenetic marks and anopther has a different set of marks. Some single gene examples are RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRAC1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) refers to multiple genes being methylated creating a kind of signature for different tumors.  This can have prognostic value, superior biomarker reliability, and better subtyping capabality. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoter regions can lead to the activation of R-RAS in gastric cancer and MicroRNA in glioma.  Genomic instability due to hypomethylation can be demonstrated in mice where  one can make a mouse without DNMT in particular tissues. When examining that tissue later, one finds that cancer developed with genomic instability. So the mutation that was produced led to genomic instability which led to cancer. The above examples make clear that the drivers of cancer are context dependent and also status dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of a gene refers to a gene's ability to be expressed from a single allele in a parent-of-origin manner. Loss of imprinting refers to replacement of this characteristic by expression from both the maternal and paternal allele or from neither allele.  It is a common finding in cancer and can result from either hypo or hyper methylation depending on the ICR and the function of the genes involved.   Imprinted genes are often involved in growth promoting or suppressing activity. </p>
<p>An example of hypermethylation of an ICR region is to be found at the H19/Igf2 locus. Normally the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated and binds to CTCF which prevents the enhancers from engaging the maternal Igf2 gene which remains silent. The enhancers work of H19. In the normal situation on the paternal gene the ICR is methylated and the CTCF cannot bind so that the downstream enhancers bind to Igf2 and it is expressed. When the loss of imprinting methylation occurs at the maternal ICR which prevents CTCF from binding,  the downstream enhancers now engage the maternal Igf2 gene and it is expressed. Now you have a double dose of growth promoting Igf2.   This is associated with Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methyl transferases inhibitors. In human cancers DNMT is thought to be responsible for maintenance DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes.  The drug is a nucleoside analogue and so at cell division the drug gets incorporated into the DNA. When DNMT comes along to bind that nucleoside and copy to the daughter strand, it is bound irreversibly and cannot be released.  The effectiveness of the drug is dependent on cell division. Since cancer cells divide rapidly it is more effective against them than healthy cells. The drug therefore acts against methylation of tumor supressor genes and cell division to produce its anti-cancer effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two sensitive periods in the "circle of life." The first is the period of pre-implantation and early development. This spans the time from the zygote to implantation and placental development. During this time DNA methylation marks are removed as are some histone marks. The second sensitive period is designated the primordial germ cell period during gestation in which epigenetic signatures are added to the egg and sperm while maintaining the marks on differing somatic cell lines. The eggs and sperm marks are differentially reset. Imprinted genes are reprogrammed in the PGC period and these marks are retained through pre-implantation and thus remain as paternal or maternal.  When treating with a anti-neoplastic agent, expecially during the PGC period, any of a variety of marks could be disturbed. These would be mitotically heritable and thus would perputate phenotypic expression.. Therefore the risks and benefits of such a decision must be considered carefully. It is especially important to consider the imprinted genes because they are often involved in promoting or suppressing growth and their disturbance is a hallmark of cancer cells.</p></div>
