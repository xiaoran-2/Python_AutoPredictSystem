    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation usually doesn’t occur at CpG islands, and conversely is found at repetitive regions, intergenic regions and inside the gene at introns.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is an epigenetic method of silencing, or preventing expression, of genes.  This lack of methylation at CpG islands which are present in ~60% of gene promoter regions allows for normal gene expression which among numerous other functions includes appropriate cell growth and death.</p>
<p>In Cancer this is often reversed, CpG islands are hypermethylated and repetitive, intergenic and intronic regions are hypomethylated. </p>
<p>CpG methylation will silence the genes in that region including tumor suppressor genes.  These genes are often responsible for regulating growth of cells, so preventing them from being expressed allows cells to grow unchecked.  Turning these genes off through DNA methylation silencing which is mitotically heritable ensures that the gene will stay turned off through all the daughter cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements prevents antisense and/or internal promoter regions from being expressed thereby interfering with the expression of the desired gene.  This also prevents the repetitive elements from ‘jumping around’ the genome which potentially interferes with multiple genes and can cause duplications, deletions and/or translocations in chromosomes. </p>
<p>Interference in these stabilization mechanisms allows these mutagenic changes to the genome to occur which disrupts the normal function of the cell causing disease.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region between Igf2 and H19 is methylated so the insulator protein CTCF is not able to bind to the region which leaves Igf2 free to be acted upon by enhancers thereby allowing gene expression resulting in production of the insulin-like growth factor 2 protein.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR of Igf2 is not methylated so CTCF is free to bind to the region.  Binding of CTCF blocks Igf2 and prevents the downstream enhancers from being able to act on the gene.  This, coupled with the lack of methylation on H19 which leaves it free to be acted upon by the enhancers, prevents the maternal allele from allowing insulin-like growth factor 2 production.</p>
<p>Disruption of the imprinting at this cluster in prevents the silencing of the maternal allele.  The imprint control region is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles in Wilm’s tumor which prevents the binding of CTCF and allows the expression of Igf2 from both alleles.</p>
<p>This overexpression will allow production of twice the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 which will cause overgrowth of the cell type affected by the error.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It works by inhibiting DNA methyltransfrease.</p>
<p>Through the inhibition of DNMT the methylation of DNA will be diluted out as the cells proliferate since in normal function DNMT recognizes hemimethylated DNA and adds methyl groups to the newly synthesized strand to maintain mitotic heritability of DNA methylation.  The dilution will result in the loss of DNA methylation in subsequent generations of cells as they proliferate.</p>
<p>This loss of methylation in cancer cells can work to restore the function of tumor suppressor genes that get silenced in cancer by aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands.  This can reduce the unchecked growth of cancerous cells and thereby reducing or eliminating tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has profound effects on the genome causing silencing of genes preventing overexpression, enabling stability of the chromosome by preventing ‘jumping’ of repetitive elements, as well as facilitating uniparental expression of genes.  Alteration of any of these and/or other methylation driven genomic functions will have a lasting effect on the phenotype of the organism as these marks are passed to all the daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those times when original epigenetic marks are being cleared and/or made.</p>
<p>These sensitive periods are found during preconception and during early development of the fetus.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods is not advisable because this is the time during which the epigenetic marks are being formed in the germ cells in the preconception phase and when the marks are being cleared and reset for the post fertilization up to implantation for the fetus.  Chemically altering the normal function of DNA methylation during these times can cause effects to the phenotype that will persist for the lifetime of the organism since these sensitive periods are the only times that these marks are determined.  </p></div>
