    <div class="field-value"><p>        Changes in DNA methylation are common in most types of cancer. Quite often the methylation is inverted from normal cells compared to cancer cells. Regions that normally are not methylated in normal cells in many cases are methylated in cancer cells. The reverse is also observed, regions that are methylated in normal cells are not methylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        In normal cells, CpG islands are usually not methylated. This allows the promoters to be active and properly activate the tumor suppressor genes downstream. In cancer cells, CpG islands are often methylated, which inactivates the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This allows tumors to grow as they are not subject to the supresing action of these suppressor genes. This methylation of CpG islands is heritable as cells reproduce so this creates more and more cells which do not suppress tumors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        In normal healthy cells, quite often the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. This keeps gives you genetic stability. In most types of cancer, the intergentic regions and repetitive element regions are hypomethylated or under mythylated. The hypomethylation results in genetic instability. This instability often causes random insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations. This genemic instability leads to tumorigenesis or the creations of tumors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        The combination of silencing tumor suppressors while at the same time creating instability that leads to tumorigenesis causes cancer tumors togrow with no control or correction'</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>        In healthy cells, on the paternal allele, the imprint control region, CTCF is methylated so that enhancers downstream do not enhance H19, rather they activate expression of Igf2. In contrast, in healthy cells, on maternal allele, the imprint control region CTCF is not methylated, so that the enhancers downstream enhance H19 and do not activate expression of Igf2. This is maternal imprinting of IgF2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        In Wilm's tumour, on the maternal allele, the imprint control region, CTCF is methylated just like on the paternal allele. For this reason the enhancers downstream do not enhance H19, rather they activate expression of Igf2. So in Wilm's tumour you have double dose or overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoter, so this causes the abnormal growth of cancer cells which is the cause of Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-family:TT17o00;"><span style="font-size:medium;">        Decitabine is a epigenetic drug that unmethylates DNA by interfering with methylation. </span></span> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-family:TT17o00;"><span style="font-size:medium;">        Myelodysplastic syndrome, originally known as prelukaemia, is an abnormality with occurs before acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine interferes with methylation that causes myelodysplastic syndrome. By preventing myelodysplastic syncrome, you keep it from developing into acute myelogenous leukaemia. Thus Decitabine indirectly helps to prevent acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>        The state of DNA methylation is heritable. That is if a cell has a methylation in a given region then that region will also have methylation in the copies of this cell. Or if a cell has no methylation in a certain region then the copies made of that cell will also not have methylation in the same region. In this way once a drug alters the methylation state, that state will be copied from then on even though the drug is no longer administered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            In relation to methylation there are sensitvie periods during which methylation is cleared and reset. Any interference with methylation or demethylation at this time would interfere with the normal clearing and resetting process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        The sensitive period would be during conception and gestation, especially for females and during entry to puberty for males. These periods are sensitive as germ cells are being formed at this time or in the case of conception and gestation the actual clearing and resetting of methylation is ocurring.</p>
