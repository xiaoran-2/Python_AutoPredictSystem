    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Role of DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong>:<br />-Methylation of CpG dinucleotide has a variety of effects, such as, transcriptional repression through recruitment of methyl binding proteins and their associated remodeling factors or X chromosome inactivation, imprinting.<br />-DNA methylation is required for efficient development of the embryo.<br />-It also plays a role in DNA repair and genome stability.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of normal methylation in cancer</strong>:<br />The normal methylation patterns are disrupted in cancer with <em>genome-wide</em> <em>hypomethylation</em> accompanying <em>region specific hypermethylation</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of methylation at  CpG contributes to cancer</strong>:<br />-Hypermethylation within the promoter of a tumour suppressor silence the gene and lead to unchecked growth of the cell causing cancer.<br />-Presence of a methylated CpG within the coding region of a gene leads to deamination and failure of repair and thus causes mutation in the region and lead to tumour.<br />-Also, alterations in the normal methylation patterns result in gene silencing and altered chromatin structure which also contribute to cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Normal function of methylation in intergenic regions(IS) and repetitive elements(RE)</strong>:<br />-Methylation of IS plays regulatory role. It helps in maintaining the genomic stability and integrity.<br />-RE represent a large portion of the human genome and contain much of the CpG methylation.<br />-Methylation levels of Alu, Sat2 and LINE-1 repeats are significantly associated with overal DNA methylation.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of methylation of IS and RE in cancer</strong>:<br />-In cancer, hypermethylation of IS is observed.<br />-Such regions serve as biomarkers for cancer.<br />-Hypomethylation of RE is characterstic of cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Their contribution to disease</strong>:<br />-Hypermethylation of IS  have a role in physiological regulation of gene expression and carcinogenesis.<br />-Methylated and differentially methylated regions have highly significant enrichment of conserved transcription factor binding sites and promote transcription of oncogenes and/or their promoters.<br />-Hypomethylation of RE impacts chromosomal and transcriptional stability of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Disruption of imprinting</strong>:<br />Imprinting plays important role in normal development. Disrupted imprinting causes certain embryonic cancers.<br />Dysregulation of specific imprinted genes cause cancer.<br />Loss of IGF2 imprinting is associated with long range intrachromosomal interactions in cancers.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of paternal allele</strong>:<br />IGF2 expression is exclusively paternal<br />IGF2 contains differentially methylated regions(DMRs). DMR1 is methylation sensitive silencer and DMR2 is methylation sensitive activator.<br />H19 is activated and Igf2 expression is reduced when the DMR deletion is paternally inherited.<br />H19 hypermethylated 5′ flanking sequences are required to silence paternally derived H19.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation of maternal allele</strong>:<br />upon maternal transmission of mutation, H19 expression is reduced and Igf2 activated.<br />DMRs set up methylation imprint, mutation causes allele specific methylation of remaining H19 sequences.<br />DMR on maternal chromosome is required for maximal expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disruption</em> of imprinting and<em> contribution</em> to Wilm’s tumor</strong> :<br />IGF2 undergoes loss of imprinting(LOI) in Wilm’s tumor.<br />LOI causes down regulation of H19 expression.<br />These changes cause alterations in paternal-origin methylation in H19 promoter.<br />Loss of heterozygosity occurs, linked with loss of H19 expression.<br />Imprinting of large domain of  maternal chromosome results in  reversal to paternal epigenotype.<br />Silent maternal IGF2 allele gets activated in Wilm’s tumor. This imprint relaxation leads to biallelic expression of IGF2.<br />Increased IGF2 gene expression is responsible for tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a cytosine analogue</strong>, <strong>inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases</strong>(DNMTs) activity.</p>
<p>-It induces highly specific, nonrandom demethylation.</p>
<p>-It has<strong><em> dual effects</em></strong> on neoplastic cells- reactivation of silenced genes and differentiation at low doses and cytotoxicity at high doses.</p>
<p><strong>Effect on DNA methylation</strong>:</p>
<p>-Decitabine gets<em> incorporated into the replicating DNA</em> and forms covalent bonds with DNMTs at the cytosines targeted for methylation.</p>
<p>-Leading to<em> stalling of DNA synthesis</em> and degradation of DNMT.</p>
<p>-Resumption of DNA replication in the absence of DNMTs results in<em> gene hypomethylation</em> and reactivation of gene expression.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer treatment</strong>:</p>
<p>-Decitabine gets converted into <em>decitabine triphosphate</em>, which directly incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNMTs.</p>
<p>-This results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.</p>
<p>-Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells restores normal function to genes that are critical for control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p>
<p>-In tumor cells, its cytotoxicity is due to formation of covalen tbond between DNMTs and decitabine.</p>
<p>-Decitabine is cell cycle specific and acts in the S phase.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Effect of DNA methylation</strong>:</p>
<p>Methylation involved in gene expression.</p>
<p>It's required for proper cell differentiation and proliferation.</p>
<p>Tumor suppressor genes are mostly silenced by hypermethylation.</p>
<p>In contrast, genomes of cancer cells are hypomethylated overall when compared to normal cells, with the exception of hypermethylation events at genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor cell invasion, DNA repair, and others events in which silencing propagates metastasis.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods</strong>:</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods, are the periods in development where the <em>epigenetic reprogramming activity is at its peak</em>.</p>
<p>These include, the<em> germ cells development and the developing embryo</em>.</p>
<p>Two specific types of epigenetic regulation established in the early development are-</p>
<ol><li>X chromosome inactivation</li>
<li>Genomic imprinting</li>
</ol><p>These regulate gene expression in a dosage dependent and parent-of-origin-specific manner.</p>
<p>Any changes in epigenetic reprogramming during these sensitive periods results in variable phenotypes and human diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment during sensitive periods</strong>:</p>
<p>Reprogramming during sensitive periods includes: erasure of DNA methylation, reprogramming of histone modifications and histone variants.</p>
<p>Any drug administration during sensitive periods can stall efficient reprogramming and lead to formation of mutated oocytes and sperms.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks are cleared and re-formed each generation, but drug administration leads to incomplete clearing and re-establishment.</p>
<p>Such transgenerational epigenetic changes are phenotypically observed in the mother, F1 generation and also the F2.</p></div>
