    <div class="field-value"><p>1: Methylation of the 5' group in cytosines located in CpG islands of DNA strands as a typical and an important epigenetic mark. Methylation of a gene promotor leads to gene silencing. Normal function of methylation is important to cell differentiation and is a part of the reason why a skin cell is different from a nerve cell in spite of a shared genome. </p>
<p>2: Normal level of DNA methylation can abnormal by several reasons. In cancer, it can occur due to a mutation in a gene coding for a regulator of DNA methylation, e.g. mutation leading to overexpression/hyperactivity of DNMT-enzymes.</p>
<p>3: If the DNA methylation is abnormal in promotors of tumorsupressor and oncogenes, it can contribute to tumor development. Hypomethylation of onco genes and hypermethylation of tumorsuppresor genes could be carcinogeneous. However, it should noted that carcinogenesis is multifactorial proces requiring errors in several genes. In other words abnormal DNA methylation can contribute to carcinogenesis is an alternative to mutations if it affects genes controlling cell cycle.</p>
<p>4: Methylation in intergenic regions and repetetive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity. Methylation in intergenic regions prevents deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations from occurring. Methylation in repetetive elements prevents transposition by silencing the repeats.</p>
<p>5: Intergenic regions/repetetive elements is normally methylated to maintain genomic stability. If the enzymes responsible for DNA methylation (DNMT1/3a/3b) were less expressed/active, the intergenic regions and the repetetive elements would be less methylated leading to genomic instability.</p>
<p>6: Genomic instability is a typical feature in the etiology of cancer because it can cause an abnormal expression of the genes controlling the cell cycle; onco genes and tumorsupressor genes. It would  of course depend on which genes become affected by the genomic instability (insertions, deletions, translocations)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1-3: Decitabine works by an nucleoside analogue mechanism (similar to the mechanisms of anti-herpes drugs and some anti-HIV drugs). But the special feature of Decitabine is that is inhibits DNMT enzymes causing a decrease of methylation level (hypomethylation). It is one the few epigenetic modifying drugs approved by FDA for medical use and it is an treatment indicated to use in cases of myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to acute myeloid leucaemia. Inhibitors of DNMT enzymes specific usage in haematological malignacies is due to the importance of hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes in haematological cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1-4: epigenetic marks is normally copied by DNMT1 in somatic cells after cell division, which is an important mechanism to ensure that differential degree is kept in a specific cell type. Sensitive periods (regarding epigenetics) are periods in the pre- and post-natal life, where the cells are more susceptible to changes in the epigenetic state, e.g. caused by the usage of DNMT inhibitors or other environmental factors. This is why usage of these farmaceuticals are inadvised in some patients. A sensitive period could be a pregnant woman carrying a fetus that would be sensitive if the drugs could pass the placental barrier, another example of sensitive tissue is an <em>in vitro </em>cultre. As mentioned in the beginning of the answer the epigenetic state is normally "inherited" through cell cycles of somatic cells; this also means that changes in the epigenetic state induced by drugs will remain through many years. This is why a more local treatment of the tumor tissue and a more specific treatment only affecting epigenetics near relevant genes would be of great value and could possibly reduce the amounts of side effects significantly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele: The ICR region at the paternal allele is normally <strong>methylated</strong>, which inhibits the insulator protein (CTCF) from inhibiting transcription of the Igf2 gene. So Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. This methylation spreads to the promotor in H19 and represses its expression.</p>
<p>Maternal allele: The ICR region at the maternal allele is normally <strong>demethylated, </strong>which allows CTCF to inhibit the transcription of the Igf2. So Igf2 is repressed in the maternal allele. The H19 promotor does not become methylated and is therefore normally expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>If this imprinted methylation is disrupted, and the ICR regions are methylated in both alleles, it would lead to increased expression of Igf2 (because of inhibited action of CTFG) and a decreased expression of H19 in the cluster (due to promotor methylation). An example of paternal uniparental disomy. </p>
<p>In tumours such as Wilm's tumour this phenomenon is seen. And the increased expression of Igf2, which acts as an onco gene (growth promotor) plays a great part in developing the kidney tumor in children. In Beckwidth-Wiedemann syndrome, which is associated with neoplasms in children (Wilm's tumour in particular) the expression of Cdkn1c (tumour supressor gene) is decreased.</p></div>
