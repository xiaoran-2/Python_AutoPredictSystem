    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of CpG islands typically correlates with the prevention of gene expression, and helps in gene stability and genomic integrity. Disruption of DNA methylation in cancer is represented by locus specific DNA hypermethylation and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. In nromal cells CpGs near intergenic elements and introns are methylated. In cancer there is a reciprocal cross where CpG islands near the gene are methylated, meanwhile, CpGs near intergenic elements and introns are hypomthylated. CpG islands methylation will lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes and eventually to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated on paternal allele allowing the expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele becasue the enhancers can work on Igf2. In the maternal allele the imprint conrtol region is unmethylated, thus CTCF will bind to it. CTCF is an insulator and will prevent the expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele. In wilm's tumour there is loss of imprinting, and we will have hypermethylation in both alleles and a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with wilm's tumuor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. In some cancer cases there is hypermethylation Decitabine reduces hypermthylation and thereby making the treatment more effective. Decitabine reduces the proliferation of tumour cells and have no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actviley erased. The sensitive period is when all epigentic marks are removed. this occurs during per implantation and gamogenesis. Treating patients is inadvisabel during these periods becasue epigentic marks are removed during these periods and then, we can say, reinstalled and using DNA-methylation inhibitors during these periods will definitely have a serious effect on the reinstallment of the vital epigenetic marks.</p></div>
