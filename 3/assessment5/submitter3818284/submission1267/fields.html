    <div class="field-value"><p>A CpG island is a region of DNA which is rich in CG dinucelotides. These CpG islands are often found at gene promoters and tend to be hypomethylated in normal cells leading to active gene expression of important genes  (for example tumour suppressor genes). In cancer, DNA methylation of CpG islands can be disrupted due to hypermethylation of these areas. If a CpG island is in a promoter for a tumour suppressor gene, when it becomes hypermethylated this will lead to gene inactivation and will be mitotically heritable. The inactivation of certain genes (e.g. RB in retinoblastoma or those genes controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair) can lead to a tumour developing and is known as a ‘hit’ in Knudson’s hypothesis.  </p>
<p>Intergenic regions are usually hypermethylated in normal tissues; this is because intergenic regions when active can frequently cause genomic instability (deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations). This hypermethylation therefore promotes genome stability. Within cancer intergenic regions can become hypomethylated – increasing gene expression from these areas. These intergenic regions and repetitive elements when active can lead to genomic instability, this can lead to disruption of certain tumour suppressor genes, or upregulation of oncogenes, both of which would promote the development of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on human chromosome 11. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. This leads to the insulator protein CTCF being unable to bind to the ICR; this causes DNA methylation to be spread to the H19 gene promoter. The downstream enhancers – which have a natural affinity for the IGF2 gene – will therefore bind to IGF2 and cause expression of this protein. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so the CTCF is able to bind. This prevents the methylation of the H19 gene and insulates IGF2 from downstream enhancers, and the upstream enhancers therefore cause expression of the H19 gene. In patients affected with Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. This can occur due to the loss of Cdkn1c (a tumour suppressor gene from the Kcnq1 cluster) and an upregulation of IGF2 (growth promoter). This loss of imprinting can occur due to methylation of the ICR leading to the enhancers binding to and subsequently increasing expression of IGF2 on both alleles providing a double dose of this growth promoter. It can also be caused by mutations, deletions or uniparental disomy (2 inherited chromosomes from father). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to the class of epigenetic inhibitors DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue (cytodine), which means that it becomes incorporated into DNA during replication. Once incorporated into the DNA it is able to bind DNMT in an irreversible fashion. This therefore reduces the spread of DNA methylation, resulting in reactivation of silenced genes. It could also reduce the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation – as DNMT1 functions to lay down methylation on hemi-methylated DNA – so if this was disrupted it would lead to a ‘dilution’ effect on DNA methylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because the genes which are re-activated could be tumour suppressor genes, which would aid in slowing down the growth of a tumour or its metastases. Some research has suggested apoptosis of cancer cells may be induced.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so if altered in a particular cell this can persist through subsequent generations. This occurs through the use of DNA methyl transferases (e.g. DNMT3a, 3b) but particularly DNMT1 which has a preference for hemi-methylated DNA (on only 1 strand) and lays down methylation on the second strand to restore full methylation, it this mechanisms that allows the methylation pattern to be passed to subsequent generations.</p>
<p>A sensitive period, in relation to epigenetics is a period of time when an environmental change may impact on the epigenetic outcome. There are two of these which occur; these are during early development (after fertilisation to blastocyst stage) and primordial germ cell development. During this time there is active epigenome remodelling (epigenetics marks are removed and then replaced) so any environmental changes occurring at this time can impact on the epigenetic marks being placed on the DNA (e.g. increased Grandparental food supply during 9-12 years of age can impact on epigenetics as PGC’s are still maturing). It would be inadvisable to treat patients during this time because the drugs could have an impact on germ cells which could have detrimental impacts on future offspring, especially as long term effects are unknown. </p></div>
