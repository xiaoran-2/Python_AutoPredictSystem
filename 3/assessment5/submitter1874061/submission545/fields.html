    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell at CpG islands are not mehylated ,this way tumor supressor genes are funtionals, when at CpG island are methylated (hypermethylation) the tumor supressor genes are silenced and appears the tumor and this is often frequent in cancer CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) - cancers where CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently methylated this show in colorectal cancer, gliomas,neuroblastoma and others , i´ts possible perform diagnosis, prognosis even monitoring use these panels of biomarkers . In nomal cell  intergenics regiones are methylated when these sites are hypomethylated cause genomic instability wich produce Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes,for example  hypomethylation due to deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissues increases genomic instability, in other words cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When ICR is methylated in paternal allele Igf2 expression is increased and H19 expression is decreased, in maternal allele this is not methylated and for this reason Igf2 expression is decreased and H19 expression is increased. In Wilm’s tumour maternal transmission from carrier mother to affected offspring,loss of Cdkn1c, overdose Igf2 and/ or other genes, this is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, Imprinted disorder, results from various abnormalities in linked Kcnq1and H19/Igf2 clusters.Loss of Cdkn1c , tumour suppressor, growth suppressing, Upregulation ofIgf2 ,oncogene, growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents like azacitidine, sold as Vidaza by Celgene. Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer, decitabine demethylate DNA and reduce the proliferation of tumour cells .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased and they do not return. Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms,sensitive periods.</p></div>
