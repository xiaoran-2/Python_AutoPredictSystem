    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of imprinting.</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated; this methylation allows the enhancers present in the cluster to act on Igf2, which results in the expression of this gene. The methylation pattern on the maternal allele is, however, different in normal tissue; in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and this allows the binding of the protein CTCF. This binding means that the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 remains silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the methylation pattern of the maternal allele is altered. The ICR is also methylated, just as in the paternal allele, so Igf2 is expressed. This implies that individuals suffering from Wilm's tumour will expressed a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting factor. This will result in the formation of kidney tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer we find an altered pattern of DNA methylation, with genome wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressing genes.</p>
<p>Normally DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing, for example the inactivation of the X chromosome in female mammals. Most CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells. However, in cancer cells there is a hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressing genes. This is rapidly selected as these cells don't die, which gives them a clear selective advantage and it is mitotically inheritable. This means that tumour suppressing genes will be silenced becoming a contributing factor to the development of cancer.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells. This methylation is involved in genomic stability. In cancer cells these regions tend to be hypomethylated. Lack of methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition of repeats and the consequent activation of cryptic promoters or disruption of neighbouring genes, which may result in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. More specifically, Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that belongs to the class DNMTi (DNA methylases inhibitors). It is division-dependent as it will stop methylation of the newly synthesised DNA strand.</p>
<p>Although the exact mechanism of action of Decitabine is not known and the long-term consequences are also unknown, it is likely to reduce the hypermethylated state of CpG islands in the promoters of tumour supressing genes, which is often seen in many types of cancer.</p>
<p>Different types of tumours have different dependency on the hypermethylation state of CpG islands, but if the correct type is identified, then Decitabine will allow those tumour suppressing genes to be expressed, thus letting the cell machinery reduce the chances of tumours to form.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations by mitosis (mitotically inheritable).</p>
<p>There are sensitive periods in development when the epigenetic status of the genome is reprogrammed. Clearing of epigenetic marks - including methylation - occurs during gametogenesis, that is germ cell development, and in early embryonic development (pre-implantation period).</p>
<p>Treating patients with anti-methylating drugs during these sensitive periods would alter the re-setting of epigenetic marks throughout the genome and potentially have long-term side effects. In the case of germ cell development it could even have intergenerational consequences, although the meotic inheritability of epigenetic marks is still unclear.</p></div>
