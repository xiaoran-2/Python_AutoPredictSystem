    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two kinds of alternations of DNA methylation in cancers.</p>
<p><br />The first kind is locus specific. It appears at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour <br />suppressor genes, or the ICRs. In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated, while the <br />repetitive element, intergenic region and introns of genes are hypermethylated. In contrast, <br />CpG islands in cancer cells are hypermethylated, leading to the silence of tumor suppressor <br />genes.  Hypermethylation of the neighbouring regions of CpG islands(CpG island shores) can <br />also lead to the silence of tumor suppressor genes. The inactivation of these genes are <br />responsible for the cancer.</p>
<p><br />Another kind of alternations are genome-wide. It usually appears on repeats or intergenic regions. These areas are responsible for the instability of genome, like deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations in genes. Nomally, they are hypermethylated so they are not expressed and their adverse effect is inhibited. However, they are hypomethylated in cancer cells. The overexpression of these genes leads to the mutation of the genome and thus result in the misfunction of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The abnormal methylations in ICRs can result in cancers by the loss of imprinting. Let's take the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster for example. </span></p>
<p>In normal cells, the ICRs of maternal allele is hypomethylated, so insular protein CTCF can bind to it and acts as an insulator which can silence the expression of Igf2 by blocking the effect of enhance; in <br />the paternal allele, ICRs are hypermethylated so Igf2 is activated for lack of the blocking effect. But in Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal allele are hypermethylated so the imprinting is lost and both Igf2 is expressed. Since Igf2 promotes growth and acts as an oncogene, the overexpression of it leads to the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine works as methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>It is a kind of nuceloside analogues so it can be incorporated into DNA during the replication. Once the DNA methyltransferase(DNMT) binds to it, it can no longer be reversed, which result in a decrease of DNA methylation. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells replicate far more repaidly, so there are more chances for decitabine to bind DNMT during replication. Thus decitabine can have more effect on cancer cells than normal cells and works as a treatment for cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically herited by DNMT and is irreversible unless it is reprogrammed, so it can have enduring effect on the epigenome even long after the drug treatment. But people should be aware of the epigenetic treatment during the sensitive periods.<br />Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic reprogramming is happening, including early embryonic development and germ cell development. During these periods, the epigenetic state is unstable and is very sensitive to the environment. So the epigenetic drugs may cause unexpected effect on the body.</p></div>
