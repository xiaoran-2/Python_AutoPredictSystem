    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation at CpG islands is a way to regulate the genes.  Not only the tumour suppressorgenes, also the growth genes are regulated. Also at repetitive elements regulation is done by dna methylation. In a normal stuation there is a balance. When there is a cancer cell there is hypermethylation at CpG islands. this results in silencing of tumour suppressor genes and activating growth genes, thereby  enabling the cancer cell to grow and divide in a much faster rate. At repetitive elements it is due to hypomethylation. The repeats will more freely transpose and recombine and generate genomic instability. Also neighbouring cells can be affected.  In this case, other mutations or epigenetic mutation can more frequently occur, contributing to the cancercell's growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the paternal allele has methylation of the H19 dna, does not express a inhibitor protein and freely expresses igf2. At the maternal allele there is unmethylated H19, that is activated and is expressed. Now an inhibitor protein can bind and igf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumour the ICR is hypermethylated. Also on the maternal allele is H19 now methylated, the inhibitor protein will not be there and Igf2 is also expressed on the maternal allele. Ths means there is twice as much expression of Igf2. This makes that the growth is promoted and and suppression of growth is diminished. For the cancercell it makes that it can grow and divide.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a approved drug (azacitidine) that inhibits dnmt. It is used to demethylate the dna, When it demethylates the dna, it reactivates the normal working situation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation can be transferred/ copied when a cell divides. The methylation pattern is so inherited by all daughtercells.  Sensitive periods are in early development or when germcells are developing (in pre-puberty). There is reprogramming of part of the methylation (for example in the paternal and maternal set). In that case the methylation patterns are set. Any demethylation, forced by drugs, can change that pattern and disturb the correct inheritance.</p>
