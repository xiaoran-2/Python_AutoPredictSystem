    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (which are mostly found at promoters of genes) tend to be unmethylated in genome, however, there are some cases/stages of development when they are methylated. Generally, the normal function of DNA methylation on CpG islands is silencing (or maintenance of the silent state) of expression of particular genes in cells. This is mostly established during early stages of development and it is mitotically heritable. In cancer cells, DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted by CpG island hypermethylation (locus specific DNA hypermethylation). In other words, CpG islands that are normally unmethylated become hypermethylated. This process can have major consequences on cells and organism. CpG islands are mostly found in the promoters of tumour supressor genes. Normally these genes are transcriptionally active, and their products are responsible for a supression of abnormal cell growth/proliferation. When CpG islands in the promoters of tumour supressor genes are hypermethylated these genes become inactive and, in combination with other factors/processes, these cells have abnormal/uncontroled proliferation, which eventually leads to development of disease. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in genome are usually methylated in normal circumstances. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity/stability. However, in cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated, thus the normal state of DNA methylation in these regions is disrupted. In general, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to a genomic instability (recombinations, insertions, deletions, transpositions, disruption of transcription in some genes...), which greatly contributes to development of disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted.Paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster has methylated imprinted control region (ICR) (and DNA methylation also spreads into the vicinal H19 promoter). Because of that, CTCF (insulator protein) can't bind to this ICR, and downstream enchancers in this cluster act on Igf2 (instead on H19), and thus promote Igf2 expression from paternal allele. On the other hand, maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster has unmethylated ICR (and H19). Because of that, CTCF binds to this ICR and insulates Igf2 from downstream enchancers in this cluster. The result is expression of H19, but no expression of Igf2 from maternal allele. It is well known that disrupted imprinting state can lead to develompent of diseases.In Wilm's tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted by hypermethylation of ICR on maternal allele. As a result, Igf2 is expressed from both paternal and maternal allele. By disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster with hypermethylation of maternal allele a cell has a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting protein, so when it is present at abnormal levels in a cell, it leads to development of tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits methylation by incorporating itself into DNA after DNA replication. Because of that, DNA methyltransferase I bounds irreversibly to Decitabine, and can no longer lay down methyl group on daughter strand of DNA. This drug has great potentional in treating diseases that are consequence of disrupted DNA methylation processes, like tumours. Development of tumours is often in correlation with increased DNA methylation in segments of genome that are normally unmethylated (for example CpG islands in promoters of tumour supressor genes). Inhibition of increased DNA methylation (in these regions of genome) by using small amounts of Decitabine can have anti-tumour effect. Decitabine is replication dependent, and due to increased rate of cell division in tumour cells, they will be more affected (in comparasion with normal cells).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although epigenetic marks are normally stable during most of organism's life, there are some periods in the development when epigenome goes through active remodelling (clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks). They are called sensitive periods and two major are: period of primordial cell development through the production of mature gametes, and period(s) of pre-implantation and early postimplantation. Epigenetic processes are most sensitive to the changes in the environment (including all drugs that have effect on epigenetic processes) during these two periods. It is not advisable to treat patients with such drugs during these periods because we can't be sure which long-lasting individual or even transgenerational consequences they could have. However, most of the treatments are performed during period of somatic maintainance. In such cases, the main concern are side-effects of such treatments/drugs. For example, altering DNA methylation processes in some genes could also have effect on epigenetic processes and expression of other genes, directly or indirectly. Because we still don't fully understand physiological pathways and gene regulation networks, consequences of such molecular alternations could be considerable.</p></div>
