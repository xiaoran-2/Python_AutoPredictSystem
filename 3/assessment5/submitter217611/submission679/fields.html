    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer simply can be caused by the activation of oncogenes, the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or instability of genomes.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are basically found hypomethylated while in intergenic regions and repetitive elements the genome in general is methylated. On the contrary, the cancer cells usually tend to have hypermethylated CpG islands and unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which is almost the exact opposite of normal cells considering the DNA methylation.</p>
<p><span>CpG islands are generally in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So leaving CpG islands unmethylated keeps the tumor suppressor genes active in the normal cells. Hypermethylated CpG islands in a cancer cell inactivate tumor suppressor genes in the epigenetically silencing way.</span></p>
<p>Given <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements,</span> DNA methylation helps maintain genomic stability and prevents cells from losing, gaining, or wrongfully recombining chromesomes. In the normal cells, the repeats and intergenic regions are heavily methylated and heterchromatonized. Despite of genetic identity of the repeats, recombination hardly happens due to the alignment of repeats. Yet when the repeats become unmethylated with an open chromtin, illegitimate alignments can occur and result in wrongful recombination. Unmethylated repeats can also activate their neighboring promoters and then lead to transcriptional aberration and genomic instability. Genomic instability tends to cause diseases and cancers. Thus, DNA methylation in <strong></strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important to keep stable genomes and avoid alterations in genomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>According to the article, Decitabine is in the form of DNA-demethylating agents. It is one of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors targeting the enzymatic epigenetic regulators. It is nuceloside analogues and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase. When cells are in replication, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors binds DNA methyltransferase, leaving smaller chances to lay down methyl groups.  Given the epigenetic characteristics of cancer cells, the drug is supposed to tackle hypermethylated CpG islands. As CpG islands are likely to be the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, to demethylate means activating tumor suppressor genes. Meanwhile, the repetitive elements might also get demethylated. Possibly, illegitimate recombinations of chromesomes are potential risks in the long run. However, </span>cancer cells usually divides much more rapidly than normal cells, therefore they are much more impacted by Decitabine via activating tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation <span>have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment simply because the changes of epigenetic markers can be mitotically inheritable. That is, the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. So even though the <span>period of drug treatment is over, the changes are persisted in the cells. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. They include mainly two periods, one of the newly formed embryo and the other of development of germ cells. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Treating patients with epigenetic drugs should avoid the sensitive period of</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> the development of germ cells, which means young patients are inadvisable. Epigenetic drugs are usually not selective and they affect possibly all the cells, including germ cells. P</span><span style="font-size:14px;">otentially transgenerational epigenetic inheritance </span><span style="font-size:14px;">through the gametes </span><span style="font-size:14px;">may have impacts over generations. Consider the similar context of food, drug and other chemical agents affecting on the sensitive period of germ cells, the grandmaternal effects and the grandpaternal effects show far-reaching impacts of granddaughers and grandsons. The epigenetic drugs can affect epigentic reprogramming of germ cells. Thus, it's advisable for young patients to avoid those drugs. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting means parent-of-origin specific gene expression. In the normal cell, imprinting expresses specifically paternal or maternal genes, which are often involved in growth. Hypermethylation of imprint control regions can cause loss of imprinting and result in cancer. </p>
<p>Consider H19/Igf2 cluster, it is usually methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's CTCF binds the insulator element, the enhancers activates H19. Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele. H19 on the paternal allele is methylated and the enhancers activates Igf2. For CTCF is not able to bind and intulate the methylated, Igf2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p>When hypermethylation of imprint control regions happens, H19 are methylated on both alleles. CTCF can't bind either insulator and the enhancers activates lgf2 on both alleles. As it is expressed from both alleles, double dose of Igf2 rather than the normal dose promotes growth and cause <span>Wilm’s tumour.</span></p></div>
