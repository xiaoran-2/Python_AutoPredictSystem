    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. The CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. The CpG islands tend to be protected from methylatio because methylation would cause silencing of gene expression due to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and prohibition of transcription factor binding, causing alteration of gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. As a result of hypermethylation, there is a loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. This allows cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis. CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. Methylation at the repetitive elements causes silencing of repeats and this prevents transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. It also may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells, there will be hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements and this leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. It can cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. These new alterations contribute to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor-2) is imprinted, with expression resulting favourably from the paternally inherited allele. The protein CTCF is involved in repressing expression of the gene, by binding to the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) and limiting downstream enhancer access to the Igf2 region. In mammals (mice, humans, pigs), only the allele for Igf2 inherited from one's father is active; that inherited from the mother is not. This is because the maternal allele has an insulator between the Igf2 promoter and enhancer and it is not methylated. For the paternal allele, the insulator has been methylated and hence CTCF can no longer bind to the insulator, and so the enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promoter, leading to Igf2 expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation at the H19 ICR of the maternal allele and this blocks the binding of CTCF and hence, the downstream enhancers can now access Igf2 to activate from the maternal allele. Together with the expression of Igf2 from paternal allele, it now has an overexpression of Igf2 (upregulation) which is growth-promoting and this leads to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. After phosphorylation, it is directly incorporated into DNA and leads to inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation and hence, it can have an anti-tumour effect. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes such as altering DNA methylation are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. As such, epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. This leads to an enduring effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where epigenetic marks are being established and there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. This happens during our early life such as the first week of life after birth where there are epigenetic modifications in response to maternal care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By treating patients during sensitive periods, we will alter the epigenetic modifications irreversibly and may affect their normal development and the key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements. These epigenetic changes will also be passed on during cell division so they may not have normal development if there are treated with these epigenetic drugs during this sensitive period.</p>
