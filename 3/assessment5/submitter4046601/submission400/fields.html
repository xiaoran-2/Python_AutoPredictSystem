    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression. DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation can cause cancer, they can active of oncongenes or incative of tumour suppressors. Hypermethylation at ICRs can result in overpression of growth promoting genes and hypomethylation can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes. Hypermelthylation can result in ICRs loss of imprinting. CpG island hypermethylation is a single biomarkers of cancer, it can distinguish cancer from normal cells. And hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, such as mutations in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is help to maintain genomic stability. In intergenic regions, DNA methylation leads to slience cryptic transposition start sites or cryptic splice sites. And in repetitive elements, it can sliencing of repeats to prevent transposition or mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition and so on. In cancer, because of hypomethylation or hypermethylation can cause genomic instability. DNA hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic make genomic instabiltiy,  It illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activationof cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. And hypermethylation can active tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. So Igf2 expressed on paternal allele and not expressed on maternal alleld. The Igf2 unmethylated on the maternal allele, When it's unmethylated CTCF, bind is insulator element, and it means that theenhancers in this case will act on H19. And on paternal allele because of methylated CTCF, unmethylated H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, with loss of impriting, Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allel and maternal allele. Because it express of Igf2 on the maternal allele, there are double dose of Igf2 in comparison in normal cell. So Igf2 both growth promoting and methylate H19 on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour caused by loss of imprinting, the maternal allele methylated of Igf2 make the cell have double dose of Igf2, that make CTCF can not bind with insulator element, hence methylate H19 on paternal and maternal allele, which caused H19 slience.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Becitabine belongs to azacitidine. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylaton is that it can combination of a histone-deacetylase and slowed tumour growth.This is the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour. And the participants in Dr. Stephen Baylin not show responese trail and went on to show <span>an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs. Decitabine can combination of histone-deacetylase and slowed tumour growth, it can prevent invasion and have more time to do routine therapy. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Sensitive period is that use drug in this period is more useful than other period. In the development period, mitosis is a sensitive period because they can pass the genome to daughter. But treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisabel, because once using drug the actively will be erased. Once erased, they do not return, and it will passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter. The therapy can stop the cancer growth but it also have possible to effect other normal cells.</span></p></div>
