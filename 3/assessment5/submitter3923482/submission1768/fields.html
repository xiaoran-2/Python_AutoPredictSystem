    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG island methylation results in the silencing of gene expression by altering the chromatin structure and therefore prohibiting transcription factors from binding. In cancer, there is hypermethylation at locus specific CpG islands, and hypomethylation of CpG islands genome-wide. This can result in overexpression of growth-restricting genes, and underexpression of tumour suppression genes. For example in Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region (ICR) of Igf2 is hypermethylated, meaning the gene is overexpressed which promotes growth of the cells.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, DNA methylation maintains genomic instability by silencing cryptic splice and transcription start sites. If these were not silenced, two promoters close to each other may clash, creating trancriptional interference when the RNA Polymerases obstruct each other. If this occurs in the middle of a gene being transcribed, deletions, insertions or translocations may occur, resulting in genomic instability. DNA methylation at repetitive elemens also maintains genomic instability by prevent transpositions due to being silenced. If the repeats are not silenced, the repetitive elements may 'jump' to another area of the DNA, which could disrupt gene promotors or the gene itself and overexpress tissue growth or underexpress tumour suprressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, DNA methylation spreads from the ICR to the <em>H19 </em>promoter, also silencing it. This means the enchancers increase the expression of <em>Igf2</em>. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so the insulator protein CTCF is able to bind, preventing the silencing of the <em>H19 </em>promoter. The expression of <em>H19</em> is promoted by the enhancers. </p>
<p>In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the maternal allele has a mutation or deletion which causes it to act like the paternal allele, therefore resulting in uniparental disomy as <em>Igf2</em> is expressed in both alleles. There is also a loss of expression of the cell cycle regulator, <em>Cdkn1c. </em>These mutations are a predisposition to Wilm's tumour. The tumour is caused by the overexpression of <em>Igf2.</em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, and inhibits DNA methyltransferase. This prevents the removal of methyl groups from DNA, therefore keeping the DNA silenced. This can prevent the gene for a histone methylater from being transcribed, and therefore the protein from being synthesised, restricting its overproduction, and allowing it's target genes to resume a more normal level of expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and so if it is altered then the change can be carried through the cell generations. A sensitive period of development is when the environment has the largest effect on the epigenetics, such as when it is being remodelled in the pre-implantation period (paternal X is inactivated) and the primordial germ cell development (somatic epigenetic marks are removed). Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods could result in a huge array of issues, as for example, uniparental disomy could occur due to the paternal X being permenantely imprinted. </p></div>
