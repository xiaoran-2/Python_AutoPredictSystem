    <h1>Submission 1862 from Anon (session_user_id: 42a2fea7a576f4ccef6f593c305b918c2f8d8811)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (EZH2) inhibitor, as EZH2 catalyses DNA methylation its inhibtiion results in an overal decrease in DNA methylation</p>
<p>In some cancerous cells, in particular cancerous lymphocytes, there is pathological upregulation of EZH2 resulting in aberant methylation and thus excessive gene silencing. This results in decreased expression of tumour suppressor genes and results in a shift towards proliferation and a cancerous phenotype. Inhibition of EZH2 by decitabine results in a decrease in aberant histone methylation and thus an increase in expression of tumour supressor genes and the associated reduction in cell proliferation and increased survival.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation pattern is mitotically heritable (is maintanied after cell division) and can therefore have persistent effects on the epigenome. In addition genes encoding proteins involved in epigenetic regulation are also subjected to control by DNA methylation, thus changes in DNA methylation can have further reaching effects than may be immediately apparrent. Like DNA methylation, the resultant epigenetic changes are also mitotically inheritable and have sustained effects upon the epigenome. Epigenetically sensitive periods (ESPs) are where there are substantial changes/reprogramming of epigenetic marks. Perturbation of epigenetic control during ESPs may result in persistant adverse changes in the cellular phenotype that may present as a disease. The most ESPs are during early embryonic development, due to the clearing of the parental epigenetic marks; and during gameate development. Treating patients with pharmacological epigenetic modifiers during ESPs may results in changes of epigenetic regulation and aberant gene expression which could result in an adverse phenotype, potentially including (and not limited to) causing other cancers, aberant metabolic control, and infertitlity.</p>
<p>The adverse effects of pharamological epigenetic modifiers during sensitive periods have not been fully evaluated (due to the obvious ethical issues) and so the risk of using the treatment and suffering the adverse effects of treatment compared to the outcome of not using it (which may be death).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Under physiological conditions DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with the silencing of gene expresison. DNA methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements (IR&amp;RE) contributes to genomic stability. In cancer there is a global decrease in methylation, however, CpG islands are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Non physiological CpG island methylation, and thus aberrant gene silencing, may result in the reduced expression of tumour suppressors, resulting in a proliferative phenotype. Alternatively there may be increased expression of oncogenes via an indirect mechanism.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of IR&amp;RE results in increased accessibility of IR&amp;RE DNA due to nucleosome relaxation. Increasing the probability of recombination events occuring, which inturn would result in abberant expression and could result in cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Underphysiological conditions the paternal allele is methylated (and thus silenced) in the imprint control region and in the promoter of the H19 gene. CTCF does not bind to the methylated imprint control region and thus expression of the enhancers occurs and promotes Igf2 expression<br />The imprint control region of the maternal allele is unmethylated under physiological conditions. CTCF binds the unmethylated imprint controlr region, resulting in the expression og the H19 gene, and the enhancers act upon the H19 gene.<br />In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation and thus both the maternal and paternal imprint control regions are methylated which results in the over expression of, the growth promoting, Igf2 gene.<br />The "double dose" of Igf2 increases cell division (as it is a growth factor) and can thus cause cancer.</p></div>
