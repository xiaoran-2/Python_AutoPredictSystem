    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG islands usually means silencing of genes. The CpG islands for expressed genes are normally unmethylated. Disruption of methylation at CpG islands will change the expression of genes and may cause or promote cancer. Silencing growth regulation genes and over expressing growth promoting genes will lead to uncontrolled cell division; cancer. Disabling of genes by mutation is known to cause diseases. DNA methylation can have the same negative effect by silencing genes. In contrast, methylation of both the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements stablizes the genom. Hypomethylation of these regions might cause illegal recombinations. The repetitive elements is found throughout the whole genome. Unmethylation of these elements might cause line up of the same elements between different chromosomes. That can lead to illegal recombinations, which might promote cancer or other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Abnormal methylation of imprinting control regions can contribute to cancer. The H19/Igf2 cluster is such a region. Normally, the maternal allele is unmethylated, and the nearby enhancers promote expression of H19 due to CTCF binding to the unmethylated imprinting control region. At the same time, the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents CTCF to be bound. This causes the enhancers instead to act on the Igs2 gene. Abnormal methylation in this cluster causes diseases. When both alleles are methylated, the patient will get twice the amount of the Igf2 gene, which results in Wilm's tumour. In contrast, if both alleles are hypomethylated, and therefor over expression of H19, may cause other forms of cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine can be used to treat some types of cancer. It is a DNA-hypomethylation agent and suppresses DNA methyltransfrase. Some types of cancer rely on methylation and silencing of cancer suppressor genes that regulates cell growth. Decitabine distrubts this methylation and reenables the suppressor gene that allows the cell to regain control. It also kills fast dividing cells by making the cells produce toxic elements. That is acheived by incorprating antimetobolity substances into the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is transfered to the daughter cell during mitotic division. The copying of methylation is a stable process and has a lasting effect. An individual will reach several sensitive periods during development. These are time spans when the environment, it may be exposure to chemicals, style of nurture, or other means, has heavy and long lasting consequences for the development of the individual. The time during development of germ cells, early embryonic and fetal development, and early childhood is all examples of sensitive periods. Disruption of the methylation process will be lasting, and any ill effects will thus last for the whole life span of the patient. Also, the epigenetic programming is still in progress for patients that still have not passed the sensitive periods. Epigenetic disruption during these times might interfere, sabotage and even change the ongoing epigenetic programming. It is therefor not adviced to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods.</p></div>
