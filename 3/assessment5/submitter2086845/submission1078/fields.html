    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGIslandsare sections of DNA consisting of higher than average frequencies of CpG sites (cytosine and quinine bonded together by a phosphodiester bond). Uusally when the genes are expressed, the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated. CpG islands are normally located at or near the transcription start site. Since CpG islands are normally not methylated, these CpG islands protect the transcription start sites from becoming inhibited due to methylation. CpG island methylation leads to silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>X-chromosome inactivation is caused by DNA methylation, which is mitotically heritable. X inactivation occurs when there are only a few hundred cells in the embryo. It is a random choice (mother of father X inactivated) for each of those few hundred cells. The daughter cells then inherit the X inactivation of the parent cell. This is easily observed in the coat color of calico cats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A normal cell has hypomethylated CpG islands and hypermethylated intergenic region and repetitive elements. A cancer cell often has hypermethylated CpG islands and hypomethylated intergenic and repetitive elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The hypermethylation often leads to silencing of tumor suppressing genes, leading to cancer tumors. Tumor suppressing epigenetics causes more tumors than genetic mutations. DNA methylation at CpG island shores (2kb on each side of CpG island) can even more accurately predict cancer. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, epimutations are rapidly selected because they reproduce more rapidly and die less often.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of methylation of the intergenic and repetitive regions results in genomic instability. This is often due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition DNA segments, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/IGF2 cluster Imprint Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. Therefore, the ICR is paternally imprinted.  H19 is produced only from the maternal allele, due to epigenetic imprinting on the paternal allele. IGF2 is only expressed from the paternal allele, due to epigenetic imprinting on the maternal allele.  CTCF is a protein that binds to the maternal ICR and insulates IGF2 from downstream enhancers.  These enhancers are then free to enhance H19 on the maternal allele. This happens due to chromatin looping. The preferred loop is between the enhancers and IGF2, but the CTCF blocks that loop and forces the chromatin loop to exist between the enhancers and H19.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, methylation prohibits CTCF binding, so the  chromatin loop lets the enhancers access IGF2, leading to  IGF2 expression. H19 is no longer active on the paternal allele due to heterochromatin spreading (or DNA methylation spreading). The DNA methylation at the ICR spreads downstream to the H19 promoter, which becomes silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, methylation on the maternal allele leads to it function like the paternal allele, producing IGF2 and not expressing H19. This leads to abnormal cell growth.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is a hypermethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>In mice, low doses of Decitabine induce CD80 (cluster of differentiation 80 protein necessary for t-cell activation and survival) molecule expression in cancer cells and stimulate tumor specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) anti-tumor responses. Decitabin induced regression of established tumors appear to be elicited by the induction of CD80 expression on tumor cells. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It has also been shown in mice that GADD45 genes regained expression after treatment with Decitabine, resulting in the return of apoptosis control. This has potential for treatment of osteosarcoma oncogenesis.</span></p>
<p>In humans, the FDA approved Decitabine in 2006 for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabin has recently been shown to reduce genome wide methylation, especially in CpG islands, resulting in effective treatment of AML (<span>acute myeloid leukemia).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that impact the epigenome can have enduring effects if the epigenetical effects are mitotically heritable. Once an epigenetic change occurs, it will last for life and not just for the period of drug treatment. Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer from growing without having to destroy all the cancer cells.</p>
<p>This is especially likely to happen during “sensitive periods”, or when altered environments have a tremendous effect on epigenetic control. This includes the period when the primordial germ cell becomes a germ cell and the period from fertilized egg to epiblast (pre-implantation to early post-implantation).</p>
<p>Treating a patient during a sensitive period is not advisable because any epigenetic side effects are more likely to occur and would likely persist throughout the individual’s life (or the primordial germ cell’s future life). </p></div>
