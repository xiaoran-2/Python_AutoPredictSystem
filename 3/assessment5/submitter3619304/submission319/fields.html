    <h1>Submission 319 from Anon (session_user_id: 6db15b52257f54f4ad07a4176553a67b97193616)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is involved in imprinting and X-inactivation. In a normal cell, DNA Methylation of a promoter region is related to gene suppression. In CpG islands of a normal cell, there is no DNA Methylation, hence, they are expressed. In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated; which causes silencing of the tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine<span> is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat<span> myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span> Combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and decitabine slows tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This is the first instance where epigenetic drugs have been successfully used against a solid tumor. People who do not show much response in this trial, show good response to <span>the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.This may be because<span> epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. This may happen because <span> epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated and lgf2 is expressed. The maternal allele is unmethylated and there is no expression of lgf2. However, in the maternal allele, H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>This is seen in Wilm's tumor. There is hypermethylation of ICR and Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour. This leads to cancer, as it promotes tumor growth.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is that period of development which is vulnerable to environmental and outside changes. The sensitive periods of development are primodial germ cell development and embryonic stem cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because changes bought about during this period can be lasting since the cells are activelt dividing and this can bring about mutations.</p>
