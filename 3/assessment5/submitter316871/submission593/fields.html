<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span><strong>Healthy cells  </strong></span>                            </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">Ordinarily, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">On the H19/Igf clubster, we have, in this order, a gene (called Igf2), an ICR, a lncRNA (called H19) and some enhancers. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">The enhancers' preferred job is to enhance Igf2. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">Maternal allele</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">When the ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF. This insulation prevents the downstream enhancers from fulfilling their prefered role of enhancing Igf2. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">Instead, they enhance H19. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">Paternal allele</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">When the ICR is methylated, the insulator protein CTCF is unable to bind to it. Therefore, the enhancers can go back and enhance Igf2. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">So Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">Some of the methylation from the ICR on the paternal allele, spreads to H19 and silences it. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><strong>Wilm's</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">If the maternal allele loses its imprinting, it becomes methylated as well, and thus also expresses Igf2. There is therefore a double dose of the growth-promoting Igf2 expressed.  This is associated with Wilm's tumour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';">                               </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><strong>Disease</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and therefore encourages cell growth. H19 is also considered an oncogene. Hypermethylation of the ICR leads to increased Igf2, as discussed. Hypomethylation would lead to increased expression of H19 which is associated with many cancers.</span></span><br /><br /></p></div>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><strong><strong><span style="font-size:medium;"><span>DNA methylation</span></span></strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">In a healthy cell, CpG islands (</span></span><strong><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">CGIs</span></span></strong><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">) are normally unmethylated. The CGIs are found at the promoters of genes, and this unmethylated state leads to the normal expression of the gene. Tumour suppressor genes with unmethylated CGIs are therefore able to inhibit cell growth.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Cancer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">In cancer cells, however, the CGIs on tumour suppressor genes become hypermethylated. As methylation is mitotically heritable, this methylation is inherited by daughter cells. In addition, the surrounding 2kb up and downstream (CPI shores) also become methylated.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Disease</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">Hypermethylation disrupts the proper expression of the gene, making it less able to restrict the growth of the tumour. Hypermethylation increases with time and is therefore corrollated with the progression of the tumour.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">Hypermethylation in itself may not be enough to lead to cancer, but can be a hit to the cell which, combined with other hits, can make it turn cancerous (as per the Knudson hypothesis).</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Intergenic regions / repetitive elements</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">In healthy cells, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually heavily methylated.This prevents the repeats from inserting themselves around the genome and causing disruption.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Cancer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">In cancer cells, these regions lose their methylation and become hypomethylated. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Disease</strong></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">This loss of methylation tends to lead to significant genomic instability, including illegetimate recombinations between repeats. This occurs when two regions which have genetic identity swap genetic material. In a normal cell, this would not be possible, since:</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">a) the repeats would be heavily methylated, and</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">b) they would be heterochromatinised. </span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">However, in cancer cells the hypomethylation allows for euchromatin and for the repeats to align and recombine. </span></span></p>
<p align="left"><br /><br /></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">Hypomethylation can also lead to the activation of cryptic promoters, thus activating further oncogenes.</span></span></p>
<p align="left"><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'WenQuanYi Zen Hei';"><span style="font-size:medium;">Experiments on mice show that if DNMT1 is removed from a particular area (eg thymus) then the resulting hypomethylation leads to genomic instability and cancer.</span></span><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It leads to hypomethylation on DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ordinarily, DNA methyltransferase is used during cell division to copy the methylation patterns on the parent cell to the daughter cell. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is a strain of DNA methyltransferase which specifically recognises hemimethylated DNA. DNMT1 binds to this hemimethylated DNA, and lays down the methylation of the parent cell on the daughter cell, thus restoring the original methylation patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the DNA methylation of the cell has become aberrant as in cancer, this DNMT1 process preserves the aberrant methylation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNMT1. This will means that when the cell divides, the methylation patterns will not be copied over onto the daughter cell. Tumour suppressor genes or DNA repair genes which had been hypermethylated (and silenced) at the CGIs on the promoters can then be reactivated. They can thus regain their original function of inhibting cell growth / repairing DNA. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained during cell division through the action of DNMT1, as described above. This means that the methylation of daughter cells is dependent upon the methylation of the parent cell. If the parent cell has an altered methylation pattern, this will pass to the daughter and granddaughter cells. Thus, any alteration in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome.</p>
<p>However, there are periods in development where DNA methylation patterns are established de novo. During these periods, the epigenome is very sensitive to environmental influences. These occur:</p>
<p>a) during the blastocyst stage (following the stripping of all previous methylation marks immediately post-fertilisation); and</p>
<p>b) during the formation of primordial germ cells (which develop from somatic cells and first have their initial somatic methylation markings removed). This completes more quickly in males than in females, where germ cells are not fully mature until puberty.</p>
<p>It would therefore be inadvisable to treat with such drugs:</p>
<p>- women who are pregnant or shortly intending to become pregnant, since the drug may disrupt the establishment of proper methylation at the blastocyst stage;</p>
<p>- men who are about to father a child, for the same reasons;</p>
<p>- girls whose germ cells are not fully mature, in case disruption of methylation of her germ cells affects the next generation. </p>
