    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code">DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the <span>covalent addition of a methyl group at the 5' carbon of the cytosine ring, <span>primarily at cytosine–guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs).</span></span></p>
<p>In cancer the  mechanisms that interfere with   the normal DNA methylation marks are  genomic hypomethylation or  hypermethylation of  CpG islands that is  associated with silencing the expression of  genes, sometimes growth supressor genes  .</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">DNA methylation is  involved in silencing of repetitive element ,  transposition, and   maintaining the genome integrity  - methylation of the  intergenic regions.</p>
<p>Cancer alters the normal layout of epigentic marks  :  the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethilated causing instability  of <br />the genome  by  promoting  illegitimal deletions, translocations and insertions .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br />Gene H19 encodes a type of RNA, called  long non-coding RNA . This kind of molecule is  being produced just from the maternal allele .</p>
<p>Its  expresion is linked to CTCF , an insulator protein.</p>
<p>Patternal allele has this imprinted  region methylated   , hence CTCF can no longer bind and  promote Igf2's expression , therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>H19 is active only on the materna allele as on the paternal allele the   DNA methylation is spreading downstream into the H19 promoter , sillencing it.</p>
<p>The  loss of imprinting in this case reflects that  there is an appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of the maternal like allele,producing too much Igf2.</p>
<p>Individuals having this mutation are predisposed to childhood tumours such as Wilms tumor which is found in the kidney  by overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of the  suppressor  genes .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a  a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor .</p>
<p>This drug incorporates into the DNA upon replication and the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to the nucleotide .</p>
<p>The drug's effect depends on the rate of the replication , there for affecting the rapid divinding cells such as the malignant cells .</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The sensitive periods such as the early development or the development of primordial germ cells  are the most important stages in epigenetic layout.</p>
<p>This periods signify the time in with the DNA gets partly demethylatated and methylated again . Interfering with the transcriptions in this periods can cause ireversible damage to the epigenetic matks therefor causing genome instability. </p></div>
