    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) tend to occur in the promoters of genes. CGIs are normally hypomethylated. CGI hypomethylation normally allows expression of (tumor-suppressor) genes.</p>
<p><br /> The cells of most cancer tumors show hypermethylated CGIs. CGI hypermethylation silences tumor suppression genes.</p>
<p><br /> Cells with hypermethylated CGIs tend to proliferate faster than normal cells. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Thus, as the cells proliferate the ratio of hypermethylated (diseased) cells to normal cells increases in a “compound interest” fashion resulting in the rapid, uncontrolled cell growth of cancer.</p>
<p><br /> The methylation situation is the opposite in introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. These are normally hypermethylated. This stops overexpression of oncogenes (growth genes).</p>
<p><br /> In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated.</p>
<p><br /> This allows gene overexpression. Over expression of oncogenes, e.g., is closely associated with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. This allows the downstream enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene so that it is expressed. (The H19 promoter becomes methylated via heterochromatin spreading so H19 is silenced.)</p>
<p><br /> In the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind to it. The lgf2 region is insulated by the CTCF protein from the enhancers so that Igf2 is not produced. (The enhancers now contribute to the expression of H19.)</p>
<p><br /> Igf2 is normally expressed by the paternal allele. When the maternal imprinting is lost the ICR is methylated (abnormal). Then there is no CTCF insulation and the maternal allele also produces Igf2. The double dose of the growth-promoting Igf2 is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p><br /> Wilm’s tumor is discussed above. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is associated with imprinting abnormalities on chromosome 11 at the Kcnq1 and the Igf2/H19 clusters. If the maternal allele behaves like a paternal allele the inhibitor Cdkn1c is silenced while the oncogene Igf2 is doubly expressed. Mutation, deletion, paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), or rarely, epigenetic loss of imprinting can cause this.<br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine [sold as Dacogen] is a DNA-demethylating agent. It limits or removes epigenetic modifications.</p>
<p>Decitabine reduces histone overmethylation. It appears to have little or no effect on normal cells.</p>
<p>Once the epigenetic markers have been modified the now-normal daughter cells continue mitotic division and remain healthy. The diseased cells respond to conventional chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genome is the DNA sequence. The epigenome can be thought of as everything else. Methlyation, the addition of a CH3 group, is a very common addition to a CpG dinucleotide or to the histones composing the chromatin, a critical component of the nucleosomes. These epigenetic markers are mitotically heritable. By definition then, the epigenome of the cell line remains unchanged; any epigenetic effects are passed from cell to daughter cells having the same (enduring) effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic markers are being established. At this point the markers are not being strictly mitotically inherited and can be modified.</p>
<p>There are two generally recognized sensitive periods of development. Case 1: the blastocyst stage. Case 2: primordal germ cell development - oocytes (female) or sperm (male).</p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenetically-modifying drugs is a promising cancer treatment. However during sensitive periods such treatment might be expected to distort, probably lethally, the expression or silencing of genes in case 1. In case 2 the reproductive function might be permanently disturbed or destroyed (female) or temporarily disturbed (male) but clearly these are secondary to patient survival.</p></div>
