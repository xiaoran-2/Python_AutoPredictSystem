    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions with a high amount and density of Guanin and Cytosine linked together by phosphodiester bonds. They can be found in coding and non coding regions of the genetic material. Especially human promoter regions are very GcP island rich. DNA methylation at GcP islands is typically associated with the expression state of the specific gene under control. The more methylated the CpG island in the promoter region is, the less likely the underlying regulated gene is expressed. Thus, (hyper)methylation of CpC islands in tumor cells can be synonymized with gene silencing. In normal cells, these islands are usually kept free from methylation. In cancer cells,however, the methylation pattern is modified such that methylation is more likely to occur than in normal cells at specific sites, depending on the kind of cancer and subtype of tumor. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions has been found as a common feature in all examined kinds of tumor cells to date and is <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">very</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">closely linked</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">to tumor</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">etiology</span> <span class="hps">and metastasis</span></span>. Subject to inactivation via this mechanism are especially tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation patterns in intergenic regions and repeats operates as a way to prevent illigitimate recombination events between nonhomologous parts of chromosoms as a result of misallignments. Furthermore, methylation enhances genomic stability and affects the package density of the DNA, namely whether it is euchromatin or heterochromatin. <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">In this context,</span> <span class="hps atn">hypo-</span><span>methylation</span> <span class="hps">is counterproductive.</span></span> So, in pathogenic backgrounds, illegimate recombination occurs with disruptive consequences. Moreover, in hypomethylated state, the potential of repeats to duplicate, replicate and transpose themselves within the genome can be awaked. They can thus disrupt promoter activity, but also lead to aberrant transcriptional patterns in surrounding regions or neighbouring genes, which leads to uncontrolled growth or to apoptosis-suppression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation patterns are different: <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">The paternal</span> <span class="hps">allele</span> <span class="hps">is</span> <span class="hps">methylated,</span> <span class="hps">whereas this does not</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">apply to</span> <span class="hps">the maternal allele</span><span>.</span></span> Exclusively the paternal allele contributes to the Igf 2 expression in normal cells, so we have got a single dose promoting and mediating normal growth processes.  In unmethylated state (maternal allele), CTCF 4 binds the insulator element, so enhancers can act only on H19, but not on Igf2. On the paternal allele, we have a different situation. Methylation prevents somehow CTCF proteins from interacting with that specific insulator region(s), so Igf2 is fully expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm' s tumor, this natural order is impaired. A mechanism to get the double dose would be to overcome the silencing of the maternally inherited allele, so that it is operating like its paternal equivalent. Since the repression is based on a trivial change, the idea of selected  methylation of the control region of the maternal copy suggests itself. Such a disruption in imprinting can occur through environmental factors in sensitive periods.</p>
<p>In this case, double dose of Igf2 means double trouble, when the maternal gene is also active and the imprinting is lost. The growth-promoting force of Igf2 contributes to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents. This cytindine/cytosine nucleotide analog could inhibit DNA methyltransferase directly,  causing hypomethylation, which influences critically epigenetic stability, continuity, contingence and compliance of the daughter cells in fast dividing cells like e.g. cancer cells. Another important part of the mode of action could consist in the incorporation of covalent adducts between the drug and DNA methyltransferase, thus braking the proliferation. Applying the drug, it should decrease DNA-methylation and lead to epigenomic modifications. Decitabine has proven to stimulate durable responses in patients, to delay<span lang="en" xml:lang="en"> <span class="hps">the</span> <span class="hps">transformation </span><span class="hps">to a</span> <span class="hps">more severe</span> <span class="hps">form of cancer running with a much poorer prognosis and to improve survival time. </span></span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">The drug seems</span> <span class="hps">in certain limits able</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">to restore </span><span class="hps">DNA methylation</span> <span class="hps alt-edited">patterns that resembles</span> <span class="hps">those of healthy cell</span><span>s.</span></span> The anti-tumor effect may be based on this <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">effects on the</span> <span class="hps">methylation pattern of</span> <span class="hps">expression</span> <span class="hps">regulatory regions</span></span> (tumor suppression genes!).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
