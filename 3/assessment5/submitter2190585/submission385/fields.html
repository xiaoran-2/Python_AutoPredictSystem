    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.DNA methylation at  CpG islands occurs in the promoters of tumor supressor genes. So in the case of Normal cells methylation at CpG islands does not takes place.</p>
<p>2.In the cancer cells, CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor supressor genes are heavily methylated leading to inactivation of tumor supressor genes thus leading to cancer.</p>
<p>3. DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements is established so as to pretect these regions from expression. Expression of these regions  and also the expressio of tumor supressor genes leads to cancer.</p>
<p>4. In Normal cells DNA methylation is established in intergenic regions  and repetitive elements leading to supression of these genes.</p>
<p>5.In case of cancer cells DNA methylation is these regions is removed so that these genes are free to express thus leading to cancer.</p>
<p>6.Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements leads to Reciprocal translocations, deletions and additions leading to progression of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. In Paternal allele, DNA methylation is established in H19 gene, so CTCF cannot bind H19 allele. Therefore Igf2 gene is expressed.</p>
<p>2. In Maternal allele, DNA methylayion is not present in H19 gene, hence CTCF can bind and enhance the Enhancers to bind to H19 gene and hence H19 gene is expressed. Igf2 gene is not expressed in maternal allele.</p>
<p>3. In Wilm's tumor. the maternal allele reverses to paternal  allele, with Igf2 expression turned on and methylation pattern in H19 gene locus leading to repression of H19.</p>
<p>4. Disruption of  Imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster leads to increased cell growth causing tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Decitabine belongs to class of DNA methyl transferases(DNMT's) inhibitors.</p>
<p>2. Its DNA hypomethylating agent. It inhibits from DNA methylation by DNA methyl transferases. It bind to DNA by intercalating so there by no allowing DNMt's to bind DNA.</p>
<p>3. Decitabine allows the expression of genes that are silenced by DNMT's in cancer cells thereby bringing anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Altering DNA methylation  pattern will alter the gene expression pattern thereby results in     repression of the genes. So indeed it plays a crucial role in development apart from involving the genome.</li>
<li>Sensitive period is the one where genome is more susceptible to epigenetic changes under the     influence of environment.  During     this period active reprograming of genome takes place during this period. Hence genome is most sensitive to changes in environment.</li>
<li>Period between development of Primordial germ cells to gametes and from Pre-implantation and early post-implantation period are sensitive periods of development.</li>
<li>As the active reprograming of genome takes place during this sensitive period any changes in the     genome through epigenome modifications would alter the gene expression     pattern of the genes hence showing deleterious effects. Hence it is not     advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</li>
