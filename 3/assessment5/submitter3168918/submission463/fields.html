    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal conditions, DNA methylation at CpG islands has three important functions: the formation of heterochromatin that operates to silence genes and maintain the structural integrity of the genome; the inactivation of the X chromosome (H3K27me of almost all 1000 genes); and genomic imprinting via the DMRs (Differently Methylated Regions).</p>
<p>                In cancer, a disruption of the methylation of the CpG islands occurs as hypermethylation. The profile of that hypermethylation (high or less high) varies according to the cancer type (tissue or organ affected) and time (age).  </p>
<p>                Some genes are called tumor suppressors because they normally prevent tumor (cancer) generation by controlling cell cycle, apoptosis (programmed cell death type I), and DNA repairs. Like in most genes, the promoters of these tumor suppressor genes are rich in CpG islands. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands leads to the silencing of these genes which can no longer prevent cancer. Hence the disease can occur. </p>
<p>Apart from the CpG islands, the methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements also plays a role in cancer.</p>
<p>                In healthy cells, the methylation of these parts of DNA functions to maintain genomic integrity or stability in several ways: silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination, and transcriptional interference from strong promoters; for intergenic regions, probably the silencing of cryptic transcription sites or cryptic splice sites thereby preventing insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>                A hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs to some degree in all cancers.</p>
<p>                This hypomethylation causes genomic instability in the form of illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition, and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. This genomic instability is another major driving force that contributes to tumorigenesis or cancer in addition of the hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> One important cluster where genes are imprinted is the H19/Igf2 cluster located on chromosome 11. Downstream of the Igf2 gene, there is an Imprinted Control region (ICR) followed by gene H19 and some genes enhancers which have a preferred loop for Igf2 instead of H19.</p>
<p>                The imprinting of the paternal allele occurs when this preferred relationship takes place through the methylation of the ICR, allowing the expression of Igf2 and the inactivation of H19 because heterochromatin or methylated DNA spreads to the latter.</p>
<p>                Maternal imprinting happens when in absence of methylation of the ICR, the insulator protein CTCF prevents the preferred relationship between Igf2 and the enhancers by binding to the ICR.  This directs the action of the enhancers toward H19 activating its expression while IGf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>                In the particular case of the Wilm’s tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted through hypermethylation of the ICR (methylation of ICR on both parental alleles) leading to the overexpression of Igf2 which is growth promoting; hence the Wilm’s cancer.</p>
<p>                However, the loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can also occur through hypomethylation within Igf2 itself leading to its overexpression and therefore to cancer (1)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-Demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine is thought to undergo phosphorylation and incorporation into DNA and then inhibit methyltransferase leading to DNA hypomethylation (2).</p>
<p>The prescribing information of decitabine also adds that when in tumors, decitabine causes this DNA hypomethylation, the normal function of genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation may be restored. Hence, decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by restoring normal cell proliferation since all cancers are caused by gene dysfunction, often tumor suppressors and oncogene dysfunction with hypermethylation of DNA in many cases. Decitabine is known to exert the maximum of its anti-tumor effect in cancers that affect certain blood cells. It helps treat the myelodysplasic syndrome by killing abnormal cells in the bone marrow and favoring the production of normal blood cells (3).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks including DNA methylation have a mitotic heritability and undergo periods of clearing and resetting. This means that changes can be brought in original cells by the alteration of DNA methylation and that epigenetic changes can persist in daughter cells when the original cells multiply.</p>
<p>                The periods of epigenetic clearing and resetting or reprogramming are sensitive periods susceptible to environmental signals. The two main sensitive periods are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development in which the epigenetic marks are respectively cleared and reset. In addition, oocytes remain vulnerable during childhood in females since epigenetic marks are not established in them until puberty.</p>
<p>                The environmental signals that can impact DNA methylation include the diet and various chemical exposures such as drug administration to treat cancer.</p>
<p>                Cancer treatments are strong methylation modifiers. Hence, it is advisable not to treat pregnant women with cancer until after mid-gestation for safe demethylation and remethylation and avoid grave diseases in the fetus or its future descendents when it is viable and fertile.</p>
<p>                This advice is also valid for girls before puberty. However, in all cases, the benefit of treatment should always be carefully weighed against damaging alterations of DNA methylation.</p>
