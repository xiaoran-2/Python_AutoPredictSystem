    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, DNA methylation is an alteration of Cytosine which almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals and is layed down by proteins (DNMT's). CpG islands (clusters of CpGs; often localized at promotors) are mostly protected from DNA methylation in normal cells (some islands are methylated, depending on the cell type). That results in the genes controlled by these promotors being active. The older you get, the more CpG islands get hypermethylated. Depending on which genes are effected this can result in cancer (inactivation of tumour suppressors!). DNA methylation at CpG islands is found very frequently in tumours (due to mitotic heribility) and is usually characteristic for the tumour type and therefore used as biomarker (e.g. the CGI of BRCA1 in breast cancer). Methylation can also spread to up- and downstream regions (shores) and effect even more gene regions (as ICR's). In some types of cancer not just single genes but gene regions are hypermethylated. This 'CIMP-cancer' is distinct from other types (older patient age, mostly women, defective MLH1, ..) and the disfunction of single genes would not have a dramatic effect. The prognosis for this type is usually good. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (eg. transposons) are usually methylated in order to keep the genomic integrity. Without methylation it would come to mutations as deletions, translocations, insertions and duplications. Furthermore, cryptic transcription start- or splice sites get silenced to prevent overexpression of surrounding genes (especially oncogenes after translocation of transposons) and transcriptional interference. In cancer these regions tend to be hypomethylated (progresses with time) what results in illegitimate recombinations between repeats, transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promotors, disruption to neighbouring genes and deregulation of piRNAs (not clear). Demethylation can occur passive by a lack of DNMT1 or active by TET- &amp; AID-proteins.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is localized on human chromosome 11 and is an example for how (de)methylation can influence gene expression by enhancer blocking. As most imprinted genes in this cluster a growth promoting protein/potential oncogene (Igf2) is expressed. </p>
<p>The paternal allele is usually methylated at its ICR. The methylation spreads and inactivates the expression of the lnc RNA H19, which would have been promoted by downstream enhancers. Instead, the enhancers function on the gene Igf2 which is localized upstream (also because of 'chromation looping'; the enhancers prioritize Igf2 expression over H19 expression when they can).</p>
<p>The maternal allele is usually demethylated at its ICR. This enables the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR and insulate Igf2 from the enhancers which instead promote H19 expression. </p>
<p>In cancer there can be hyper- or hypomethylations at ICR's what resluts in a loss of imprinting. In the case of Wilm's tumour both alleles (maternal and paternal) are methylated, so there is a overexpression of the oncogene Igf2. The maternal allele behaves like the paternal, so the disease is maternally transmitted. Wilm's tumour is a kidney cancer and usually affects children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Decitabine</em> is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and belongs to the DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). As <em>Vidaza </em>it is FDA approved. DNMTi's are small molecules which bind irreversibly to the active site of enzymes and therefore inhibit their function. They belong to the 'nucleoside analogues' because they need to be incorporated into the DNA before they can act thus they are replication dependent. Due to their rapid division cycles, cancer cells are more effected by DNMTi's than normal cells. DNMTi work globally, so there can be sideeffects, however the survival of the patient is the primary aim. At high concentrations DNMTi's are even less specific and therefore toxic. </p>
<p>In general it is not completly clear how DNMTi's work but they seem to prevent hypermethylation of CpG islands which are often a poor prognostic indicator. DNMTi are tested in combination with other standart chemotherapeutics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitoticly hereditable. During replication DNMT1 transferes methylations from the original string to the replicated string. Thereby, tissue homogenity is ensured and that daughter cells express the same set of genes.</p>
<p>After tumour cells have been treated with DNMTi there were less methylations in the daughter cells (passive demethylation &amp; no <em>de novo</em> methylations). These epigenetic patterns were also transfered to the daughter cells after the treatment. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods due to epigenetics are <strong>reprogramming periods</strong>. They occur during pre-implantation, germ cell development and also other tissue specific, shorter periods. During these periods most of the genome becomes demethylated (apart from repeats) in order to lay down new epigenetic marks. Moreover, the environment (chemical exposure, maternal care or diet) can influence epigenetics. These alterations will be transfered to daughter cells due to mitotic heritability. An example is the 'Dutch Famine': Babies exposured to famine periods during early gastrulation had lifelong disorders. </p>
<p>Treating patients during a sensitive period always has consequences in future. For example, treatment during germ cell development with epigenetic alterating drugs would have massive effects on the germ cells (eg puberty smoking of fathers being correlated with an increased BMI in sons) and thus on the offsprings. </p></div>
