    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">A prominent site for methylation is the cytosine base within cytosine–guanine dinucleotides (CpG sites where stands for the phosphate bond between the two bases). CpGs are frequently clustered in high density at CpG islands (CpGIs). CpG islands are 1) frequently associated with promoters; 2) often protected from methylation. When CPIs do become methylated this is generally associated with repressive chromatin structure, prohibition of transcription factor binding and gene silencing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"> CpGIs are <strong>hypermethylated</strong> in cancer.   Hypermethylation in cancer of CpGIs associated with promoters causes silencing of the genes associated with them.  These genes are often tumor suppressors. When a tumor suppressor gene is silenced cell division will accelerate and the cells may also be more resistant to cell death.  Thus, these cells have a competitive advantage over the surrounding cells and can overcome the surrounding normal cells. Random mutations in epigenetic enzymes, such as EZH2 and other polycombs, are candidates for the cause of hypermethylation and for hypomethylation described below.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  Methylation of these areas may: 1) maintain genomic stability; 2) prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination; 3) avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. DNA <strong>hypomethylation</strong> of intergenic regions repetitive elements is characteristic of all cancers.  Loss of methylation of the repeats reduces the heterochromatized state facilitating illegitimate recombination between repeats..  Additionally, activation of repeats allows transposition of a gene to a new and inappropriate position in the genome resulting in a mutation.  Additionally a normally inactive promoter, made so by methylation, may become active. Activation of these “cryptic promoters” can disrupt the normal expression of neighboring genes. These changes are clear examples of genomic instability.  As they are due to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements support the hypothesis that DNA methylation of these areas normal contributes to genomic stability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">Expression of Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is an example of parent-of-origin genomic imprinting.  Only one allele, inerited from the father, is expressed.  </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Following the convention of viewing the genome from left to right, in normal cells the Igf2 gene will be found first.  An imprint control region (ICR) and the H19 gene follow Igf2 and are <strong>methylated in the parental allele</strong>.  Methylation of the ICR prevents the insulator element CTCF from binding to it.  This, and the methylated state of H19, prevents enhancers that follow H19 in spatial distribution from acting on H19.  Instead the enhancers act on Igf2 causing it to be expressed.  </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The ICR and H19 <strong>are not methylated in the maternal allele</strong>.  CTCF is free to bind to the ICR.  The presence of CTCF on the ICR and the lack of methylation of H19 cause the enhancers to act on H19 rather than Igf2 so Igf2 is not expressed in the maternal allele. </p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In Wilm’s tumor methylation is present at the ICR and H19 on the maternal allele, i.e. it looks like the paternal allele.  The result is extraordinary high levels of the Igf2 peptide which is a growth-promoting substance.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  This stops DNMT from laying down methyl marks.  Decitabine’s effectiveness is shown only in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  MDS result from mutation of bone marrow cells responsible for production of multipotent cells that normally differentiate into red and white blood cells.  Mutation impairs appropriate differentiation.  The result is low blood cell count (both red and white) which becomes progressively worse as the mutated cells divide. Evidence exists that at least one mutation in these cells in MDS is to the <em>de nova</em> methyltransferase DMNT<sub>3a</sub>.  The clinical effectiveness of decitabine in combating MDS is compatible with a mutation to DMNT<sub>3a</sub>. Decitabine produces its anti-cancer effect through incorporation into the DNA of multipotent cells.  Inhibition of <em>de nova</em> methyltransferase occurs in the treated cells and as they divide hypomethylation occurs in the daughter and granddaughter cells.  Control over normal cell growth is thus restored.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This course's definition of epigenetics states only “mitotically heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in gene sequence” are epigenetic.  This suggests how drug-induced alteration in DNA methylation might produce long-lasting effects.  The drug might alter features of the epigenomic DNA, or perhaps be incorporated into the DNA as a marker, without altering sequence.  Mitosis would pass such changes to daughter cells, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A sensitive period is a stage when challenges to the developing organism have the greatest potential to produce lasting, usually harmful, change.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The primary epigenetic sensitive periods are during active reprogramming/remodeling of epigenetic marks, i.e. the period of primordial germ cell (PGC) development and the early pre-implantation stage through blastocyst formation.  Drug-induced changes during PGC development might cause changes such as loss of parent-of-origin imprints in offspring of the person who developed from the exposed embryo if, for example, PGC ICR methylation which establishes these marks is lost. Drug targeting during the pre-implantation to blastocyst formation stage may produce everything from embryo-lethality to long-lasting genomic instability as the altered epigenome is passed through mitosis for the life of the individual.</p></div>
