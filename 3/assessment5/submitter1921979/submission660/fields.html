    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands (CGIs)</strong></p>
<p>CGIs <strong>preceding promoters of genes</strong> are <strong>hypomethylated in normal cells,</strong> so they are loosely packed and are accessible to the transcription machinery activating these genes. This applies to tumor suppressor genes also.</p>
<p>In <strong>cancer cells, these regions especially in <strong>tumor suppressor genes </strong>are hypermethylated</strong> causing <strong>silencing of tumor suppressor and other genes like DNA repair genes or cell cycle regulators</strong>. This can occur in a single gene or in sets of CGIs or also in CGI shores. In case of hypermethylation of sets of CGIs, the group of CGIs hypermethylated differs by tumor type.  As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the silencing is passed on to the progeny cells. It can be used in diagnosis, prognosis and informing the treatment of cancer.</p>
<p> <strong>Intergenic Regions (IRs) and Repetitive Elements (REs)</strong></p>
<p>In<strong> normal cells the CpGs in IRs and REs are methylated</strong>. The methylated IRs maintain <strong>genomic stability</strong> and  silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The methylated REs also maintain genomic integrity by preventing transpositions, mutations in repeats, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In <strong>cancer cells</strong>, <strong>genome wide hypomethylation</strong> is observed. IRs and REs are hypomethylated. This leads into expression of these regions resulting into <strong>genomic instability</strong>, and  illegitimate recombination between repeats. The recombination occurs between genetically identical regions. In cancer cells, the hypomethylated large identical tracks of repeats are recognized as identical regions and recombination occurs between them. REs make copies of themselves and transpose. They disrupt the active genes or activate the silenced genes.</p>
<p><strong>Imprint Control Regions (ICRs)</strong></p>
<p><strong>In pre-neoplastic tissues hypermethylation or hypomethylation</strong> in ICR can cause <strong>loss of growth restricting genes </strong>and<strong> overexpression of growth promoting genes </strong>depending upon the context. Eg. Hypermethylation in ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster leads to overexpression of Igf2 causing Wilm’s childhood kidney tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells</p>
<ol><li>The Imprint Control Region (ICR) in <strong>paternal allele is methylated</strong>. This methylation is also carried to H19 gene promoter. This causes <strong>silencing of H19 gene</strong>. The enhancers can access the Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) gene as CTCF cannot bind to methylated ICR and thus results into <strong>transcription and translation of Igf2</strong>.</li>
<li>The ICR in <strong>maternal allele is unmethylated</strong>. This allows binding of CTCF insulator to this region blocking the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers silencing the Igf2. The enhancers bind to the H19 promoters causing its active transcription and translation.</li>
</ol><p>Due to this differential methylation pattern in maternal and paternal allele, the Igf2 and H19 production is regulated.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor which is a type of childhood kidney tumor, the paternal allele shows the same pattern of methylation as the one in normal cells whereas the<strong> ICR in maternal allele is methylated</strong>. Both alleles behave like the paternal allele. This causes <strong>upregulation</strong> i.e. overexpression <strong>of Igf2 which is a growth promoter which in turn upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation.</strong>This along with other insults such as somatic ablation of wt1 that blocks mesenchyme differentiation result into tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, an epigenetic drug belongs to the class of <strong>DNA methyl transferase (</strong><strong>DNMT</strong><strong>) inhibitors. </strong>They are used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome-precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is <strong>cytidine aza-nucleoside analogue</strong>. Decitabine is incorporated into DNA strands upon replication. <strong>DNMT binds to it to copy methylation on daughter strands at the time of cell division. This binding is irreversible. Thus DNMT cannot be released causing depletion of DNMT and resultant DNA hypomethylation that activates the illegitimately silenced genes in cancer cells</strong>.</p>
<p>It is effective in<strong> treatment of hypermethylation that occurs in tumor suppressor genes</strong> in hematological malignancies. It also has potential use in treatment of solid tumors.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Decitabine acts upon <strong>actively dividing cells</strong>. The cancer cells divide more frequently than normal cells and therefore the drug acts more on these cells.But it acts upon all the dividing cells and may show side effects in long term. <strong></strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The objective of use of DNA methylation alterations in cancer therapy is to modify the epigenetic markers and to activate tumor suppressor genes that are silenced in cancer cells without damaging DNA. These alterations are <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>.Once the DNA methylation pattern is modified, it is <strong>passed on to the daughter cells</strong> till the time it is reprogrammed. So their effect can be seen in the progeny cells even after discontinuing the treatment unless they go through sensitive period. It is experimentally observed that after this treatment tumor cells are altered in such a way that they become more susceptible to standard chemotherapeutics. </p>
<p>These are <strong>sensitive periods i.e. periods of epigenetic reprogramming</strong> when all the earlier genetic marks are erased and new marks are laid down. This occurs in <strong>preimplantation period of early development and primordial germ cell development </strong>to<strong> </strong>gain pluripotency.  Therefore while treating younger patients, the effect of these drugs altering DNA methylation on the germ cells should be considered. Because during the sensitive period of gametogenesis exposing cells to epigenetic drugs would be a major environmental insult and it may result into aberrant epigenetic reprogramming. </p></div>
