    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNMT (DNA methylotransferase). Occurance of hypermethylation was described in various types of cancer. In a normal cell there is no methylation in general  at CGI (CpG island). At a cancer cell CGI are more likely to be methylated.  CGI are often found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethyaltion leads to inactiavation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine are division dependent they act the most in cells with high frequency of replication. This means that cancer cells which are dividing the most rapidly are the most affected one. Decitabine by irreversible binding to DNMT  suppress the process of passing on methylation mark after cell division. By disruption of normal function of DNMT new cells after divisions are lack of methylation marks. In consequence Decitabine leads to CGI  hypomethyaltion and activation of tumor suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
