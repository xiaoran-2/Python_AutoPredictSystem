    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer is altered in two fundamentally different ways.  First, cancers exhibit hypomethylation throughout the genome in intergenic and repetitive elements, which are typically silenced by DNA methylation in normal cells.  In cancer, hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (as well as other types of activation via chromatin remodelining, long noncoding RNAs, and histone modification) can alter chromosome stability and nuclear organization, contributing to tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>The second way DNA methylation can be altered in cancer is via hypermethylation of CpG islands.  Normally, CpG islands, which typically reside within gene promoters (e.g., of tumor suppressor genes), are unmethylated.  When a normal cell's unmethylated CpG island becomes hypermethylated, it can result in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, giving the cell a growth advantage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine is a member of a class of epigenetic drugs called "DNA demethylating agents", which, as their name suggests, reduce the number of C5 methyl groups on DNA.  Decitibine does this by preventing DNMT1 from transferring methyl groups to nascent strand during replication.  This can work to counteract the hypermethylation exhibited by many cancers at CpG islands, specifically at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  In this way, Decitibine has an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Different tissues in the human body exhibit different patterns of DNA methylation throughout the genome, and these patterns are maintained by enzymes called DNA methyltransferases when a cell divides.  This is how the tissue maintains its identity.  But when epigenetic drugs are used to alter a cell's DNA methylation pattern, that new altered pattern will also be maintained in the descendants of the treated cells.  This is how epigenetic drugs which alter methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome. This can have positive effects on cancer treatment by sensitizing cells to treatment.</p>
<p>But there are sensitive periods during human development, when cells are "reprogrammed" with respect to DNA methylation.  These periods include the early development of the embryo (up to the stage of epiblast) and the period in which primordial germ cells are created and evolve into gametes.  If patients are treated with epigenetic drugs during these periods of reprogramming, there is the potential to interrupt necessary establishment of particular patterns of DNA methylation, and to establish new, incorrect patterns which will persist and have negative effects.  This is why it is inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele.  The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele allows the binding of CTCF, which acts as an insulator by blocking distal enhancers from the Igf2 gene. So in normal cells, the Igf2 maternal allele is not generally expressed.  On the paternal allele, however, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF does not bind, and distal enhancers are able to act on Igf2.  In this way, the paternal Igf2 allele is more highly expressed than the maternal allele in normal cells.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor, however, hypermethylation of the Igf2 ICR, even on the maternal allele, leads to overexpression of Igf2, which gives a growth advantage to the cells, since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</p></div>
