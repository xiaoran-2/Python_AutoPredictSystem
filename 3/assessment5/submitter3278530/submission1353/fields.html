    <div class="field-value"><p><span> DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin</span><span>. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression</span><span>. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters</span><span>. DNA methylation can occure because of mitotivally heritance or by epimutations. CpG islands which are somehow the promoters, are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state</span><span>. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</span><span>. These silencing can lead to lots of disease or cancers. take for example this occure in a tumour suppressor gene because CpG islands are found mostly in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Then we will observe a rapid prolefiration in the cells which will result in the cancer </span> In a normal cell, there is a hypomethylated CpG island but in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and the introns there is hypermethylation which means they are methylated. Conversely, in cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated but the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements, intergenic elements and the introns are hypomethylated which means they are not methylated. These means that the <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be activated and  start to experssion which can casue DNA instability by causing illegitimate recombination between repeats like reciprocal translocations, or activation of repeats and transpositions or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One common features of cancer cells is loss of imprinting. In this case, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression but instead they become either expressed from maternal and paternal alleles, or silent from both parental alleles. In H19/lgf2 cluster the imprint control region in paternal allele is methylated and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated, CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and enhancers in the genome will act on H19 but Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele. On the paternal allelesince the imprint control region is methylated, enhancers will act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to the imprint control region, and IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. With loss of imprinting by high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele we observe expression of Igf2 too, which were silence before this epigenetic mutation. So we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. Since Igf2 is both growth promoting, it cause Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a FDA approved drug, which is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company and are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. When Decitabine incorporated into the cell, during the DNA replication when DNA methyltransferase comes along to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. This means that the replication of cancer cells will be suppressed because the DNA replication in the cancer cells are far more than normal cells. In this case it can play as a anti-tumour drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetics works normally in multiple layers not by only one factor, so putting multiple targets together can be more effective in epigenetic drug therapy. If these epigenetic drugs be used throughout the system, they can affect every cell in the body. So treating younger patients, particularly those that have developing germ cells for example in sensitive periods, is not advised because these drugs may inhibits the epigenetic machinery.  </p></div>
