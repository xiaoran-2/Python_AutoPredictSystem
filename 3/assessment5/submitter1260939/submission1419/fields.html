    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is usually unmethylated at the CpG islands which tends to be protected from it. Methylation at CpG islands results in the silencing of Gene Expression.</li>
<li>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark. In cancer, the  epigenetic aberration found at CpG islands is hypermethylation, DNA methylation at CpG islands is mitotically inheritable and leads to silencing of Tumor Suppressive Genes which is an alternative to the clustering of genetic mutations.</li>
<li>In many disease process,<span>gene promoter CpG </span><span>acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing</span><span> that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene,<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;"> </span>and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl CpG binding proteins proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histones deacetylases and other chromatin remodelling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming heterochromatin.</span></li>
<li><span>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic region is to maintain the genomic integrity and silence the cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic region are maintain genomic inegrity, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats, so avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters. and methylation of repeats so as to prevent illegitimate recombination.</span></li>
<li>A major contributor toward the overall DNA hypomethylation is hypomethylation of  intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which is observed in most examined cancers. Also, Both losses and gains of DNA methylation are observed, thought to contribute pathophysiologically by inactivating tumor suppressor genes, inducing chromosomal instability and ectopically activating gene expression.</li>
<li>In diseased condition, DNA hypermethylation is an important marker.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The methylation pattern for paternal allele is methylated. So, the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome. On the paternal allele when CTCF which is an insulator protein is blocked by DNA methylation at ICR, which inhibit its spread to the H19 promoter and allows the enhancers to access the Igf2 to activate and express.</li>
<li>The methylation pattern for maternal allele is unmethylated. So, when CTCF which is an insulator protein is not blocked by DNA methylation at ICR, which allow its spread to the H19 promoter and blocked the enhancers to access the Igf2 to activate and express.</li>
<li><span>In Wilms tumour, biallelic expression of </span><em>IGF2</em><span> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a Differentially methylated region in </span><em>IGF2.</em><span> This Differentially methylated region has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele with a role in repression.</span></li>
<li><span><span>Disruption of imprinted gene expression at <span>H19/Igf2 cluster</span> can result from genetic or epigenetic alterations. Genetic alterations such as duplication, deletion, translocation, inversion, and mutation in imprinted regions have been shown to cause disease. Epimutations that are extrinsic to the primary DNA sequence have also been shown to cause disease.</span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA de-methylating agents.</li>
<li><span>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. <span>By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Decitabine is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. <span>Decitabine exhibits antitumoral properties at clinically achievable doses and may be an effective adjuvant therapy in patients Cancer. Decitabine recovers expression of silenced genes which suggests a possible role of epigenetic gene silencing in carcinogenesis.</span></span></span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation at the time of epigenetic programming is very important because the different set of genes need to be expressed during different phases of development. It is necessary to prevent the genomic instability which leads to the increased chances of advanced disease such as cancer.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods denotes the period of epigenetic reprogramming.</li>
<li>Epigenetic signatutes are mitotically inheritable, So, the period of development between generations are the sensitive periods.</li>
<li>Patients are not advisable for treatment during sensitive periods because it will disrupt the epigenetic programming and cause different kinds of pathologies to the patient. </li>
