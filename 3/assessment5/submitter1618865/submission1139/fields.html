    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression. DNA methylation may physically impede binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene and methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins. These proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromating remodeling proteins that can modify histones to form compact and inactive chromatin called heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands remain unmethylated allowing gene transcription. However, in cancer cells, although both CpG islands and CpG island shores may be strongly methylated, gene bodies lack this modification. Therefore, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and aberrant transcription may occur from incorrect transcription start sites. In cancer cells, global hypomethylation triggers genomic instability and aberrant transcription initiations.</p>
<p>In many disease processes, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. The alteration of DNA methylation has been recognized as an important component of disease development.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity. They silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements also maintains genomic integrity. It silences the repeats to prevent transposition. Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation is mutagenic that may prevent transposition. The silencing of repeats also avoids transcriptional interference from stron promoters.</p>
<p>In cancer, aberrant methylation is found. There is a genome wide lack of methylation leading to hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats, and genomic instability.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to global hypomethylation due to disruption of DNA methyltransferases may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis, thus resulting in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, less than 1% of genes are imprinted meaning that gene expression occurs from onlly one allele. The expressed allele is dependent upon its parental origin. <br />In germline cells, the imprint is erased and then re-established according to the sex of the individual i.e. in the developing sperm during spermatogenesis, a paternal imprint is established.<br />Gene encoding Igf2 is only expressed from the allele inherited from the father. <br />Methyl tags normally silence the maternal Igf2 gene. Activation of the maternal Igf2 gene during egg formation or very early in development causes Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.<br />In Wilms' tumors, there is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19, IGF2 and KIP2. Allele loss is specific for the maternally inherited allele. IGF2 is maternally imprinted and so maternal allele loss leads to either no change in effective gene dosage or to increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication. H19 is paternally imprinted.<br />Mutation or deletion of the maternally inherited copy of these genes therefore results in loss of all active gene function circumventing the requirement for mutation of the retained paternally inherited copy resulting in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to hypomethylating agents and is a cytosine analogue.<br />Decitabine causes global hypomethylation. It decreases DNA methylation and augments CTR1 expression through methylation-independent mechansims.<br />Decitabine produces its anticancer effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis and results in cellular death. Thus it stops cancer from growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Therefore when we alter DNA methylation using some kind of drugs, it might have enduring effects on the epigenome and lead to the impact of drug lasting beyond the period of drug treatment.<br />Sensitive period is the time in early life when there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. <br />The sensitive periods are as follows: 1. Period from promordial germ cells to production of mature eggs and sperm 2. pre implantation and early post implantaion period <br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is indavisable because lots of enviromental factors like diet, temperature can affect the cells during this period.</p></div>
