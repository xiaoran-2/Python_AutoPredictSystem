    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can result from the activation of oncogenes and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. According to Knudson's hypothesis it takes more than one aberration for a cell to become cancerous. In this weeks lectures Dr Blewitt provided strong evidence that methylation patterns vary significantly between normal cells and cancerous cells thus distinguishing between healthy and diseased.  Scientists have determined that genome wide methylation is more prominent in healthy cells while cancer cells have decreased methylation. Methylation in normal cells helps to keep oncogenes in check thus the decreased methylation in cancer cells may result in the activation of oncogenes and contribute to cancer. Though cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation when examining the genome they have hypermethylation of CpG islands while normal cells have a low level of CpG island (CGI) methylation.  CGIs are found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes therefore when these regions are methylated it is more likely to silence the gene resulting in increased growth and cellular activity. The hypermethylation of CGIs has been found in all tumor types though they differ in their epigenetic profile as exhibited in gliomas and colorectal cancer. The lack of methylation in normal cells results in suppressor proteins being expressed helping to regulate growth. While cancer cells have hypermethylated CpG islands they exhibit little methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements which is the exact opposite for normal cells. This lack of methylation can result in the activation of oncogenes or other growth factors. It is clear that a change in methylation pattern exhibited through epigenetics contributes to cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are many different epigenetic alterations that contribute to cancer including disruption of imprint patterns. A clear example of how imprint disruption contributes to cancer can be seen in the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell the maternal cluster has an unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) that interacts with CTCF and enhancers resulting in the expression of H19. There is no expression of Igf2 maternally because the ICR/CTCF region blocks enhancers needed for expression. On the other hand the paternal cluster has ICR and H19 regions that are methylated thus allowing enhancers produced upstream to express Igf2. In patients with Wilm's tumors there is hypermethylation where both the maternal and paternal alleles exhibit ICR and H19 methylation thus there is no expression of the H19 allele because the insulator (CTCF) does not bind the ICR and there is over expression of Igf2 due to enhancer interaction. The excessive production of growth factor due to the loss of monoallelic imprinting in cases of Wilm's tumors results in overexpression of alleles associated with growth. Disruption of imprinting will result in expression or silencing of both alleles and when genes are associated with growth it may result in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug that belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methylation transferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. According to Dr Blewitt when a patient takes Decitabine the nucleoside analogs are incorporated into newly synthesized DNA. When DNMT binds to these analogs to enzymatically transfer the methylation pattern they are irreversibly bound to the DNA (thus the categorization DNMTi). It is thought the decrease in methylation may be effective in lowering the methylation seen at CGIs and their shores allowing tumor suppressor genes to continue doing their job. In low doses the Decitabine has shown to be highly effective in killing tumor cells and though the drug mechanisms may not be fully known there has been an increase in the prognosis of patients with AML.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin's speculation brings to mind that when treating people with epigenetic drugs it is important to remember DNA methylation may be mitotically or meiotically heritable. For example, when cells divide the methylation patterns of the original DNA are transferred to the newly synthesized strands by DNA methyltransferase. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs cannot be done at any given time due to developmental sensitive periods. Dr Blewitt's made clear that there are times of active remodeling of the epigenome and during these times cells are most sensitive to their environment. These sensitive periods include primordial germ cell to gamete formation and preimplantation to early post implantation of an embryo and when tissues are differentiating there are brief windows of epigenetic change. Children would be more susceptible to long lasting effects and the use of these drugs should be carefully weighed against the consequences. Most of our adult lives are spent in a period of somatic maintenance which may provide an optimal window for epigenetic treatment. The use of epigenetic drugs for cancer treatment seems promising but there is still much to learn in regards to how the drugs work and the long term effects they might have.</p></div>
