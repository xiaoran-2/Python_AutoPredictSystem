    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell there is hypomethylatin at CpG islands, however there is methylation occuring in repetivive element, intergenic region and in the introns of gene. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, however the other regions like the repetitive element, intergenic region and introns are hypomethylated. Since most of the CpG islands are often at promoters of genes, methylation at CpG island leads to silencing of gene expression. Since CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells, genes are silenced.The genes are the tumour supressor genes. Since tumors supresser genes are silenced, the cell can now become tumerous and divide rapidyly. As a result inactivation of tumour supressor genes leads to cancer, since the cells can divide rapidly and uncontrollably. CpG island hypermetyhlaion can be used as a biomarker for Diagnosis, Prognosis and Monitor tumour declne or recurrence. As said before, in normal cell the intergenic region and repetitive elements are hypermethylated to prevent transcription of those genes. However in cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetive elements are hypomethylated. The hypomethylation of repeats/intergernic intervals leads to genomic instblily like illegitamate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic promotoers and distruption to neigbourinng genes. These kind of genomic instabilities are one of the "hits" that lead to development of cancerous cells.</p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation is context dependent. Hypermethylation of CpG island leads to tumour suppressr hypermethymethylation, therefore depeletion f DNA methylation appears to suppress tumoriogenesis. However, in case of chrmosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhace tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells show loss of imprinting. Meaning the genes are either expressed from both parental alleles or silenced from both parental alleles. Loss of imprinting is found in cancer cells because the genes are usually involved  in growth over expression or growth supression.</p>
<p>In normal cells,  Igf2 is methylated on paternal allele and unmethylated on maternal allele. When unmethylated the CTCF will bind to the insulator element and as a result the enhancers will act on H19 and the Igf2 will be silent from maternal allele. On the paternal allele because the insulator and H19 gene is methylated, they are silenced. Therefore, the enhancers bind to Igf2 and igf2 is expressed. </p>
<p>In cancer cells you have hypermethylation of imprint control gene on the maternal allele. As a result you have incresed transcription of Igf2. Igf2 is growth prmoting and results in Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibotrs. Decitabine are approved for use in myelodyspastic syndrome to AML. Decitabine is a nucleoside anologue that irreversibly binds to to DNA methyltransferase after they are incorpared into DNA. Therefore, they are replication dependent since they are incorporated into DNA. At very high doses Decitabine is toxic however at much lower doses, Decitabine has very good effects. Decitabine has haematological malignancies since they are dependent on tumour supressor gene hypermethylation. It is beleived that Decitabine has effects on other tumours but it has not been scientifically proven. Therefore there are trials ogioing with Decitabinein many other tumours, including solid tuours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond te period of drug treatment because those drugs bind irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase. As a result the function of DNMT is inhibited. The DNA methylation can have enduring effects on epigenome because the hypermethylation of CpG island and hypomethylaton of intronic and repitive elements can result in normal cells becoming tumour cells. As a result the effects of DNA methylation can have enduring effects.</p>
<p> A sensitive period in terms of epigenetics is a<span> period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture. Sensitive periods of developments are Early development and germ cell development. Treating patients during sensivite periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic reprogramming occurs during those peridos. Therefore during this period many of the epigenetic marks are erased and then re written. Since they are erased during this period it is not effective to treat during sensitive periods. </span></p></div>
