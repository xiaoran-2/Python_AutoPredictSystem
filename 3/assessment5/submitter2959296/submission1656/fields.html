    <h1>Submission 1656 from Anon (session_user_id: 9bfbb4b5dceb372bffce80545adf781b6bdf5be0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylating agent (refered in the article as a DNA-demethylating agent). It acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase inhibition causes the reduction of methyl groups that will be added to DNA. Since overmethylation tends to silence genes, the reduction of DNA methylation reactivates genes that have been wrongly inactivated in malignant cells. In neoplastic cells, decitabine-induced hypomethylation is thought to restore the normal function of genes that are essential for the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Consequently, neoplastic cells stop their uncontrolled proliferation after getting back the regulators they lost. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation can last beyond the period of treatment because the epigenetic marks (molecules added to chromatin) can be passed on from mother to daughter cells during cell division. This means that the epigenetic changes generated in a cell's genome through therapy is likely to be present in its offspring too.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in the context of epigenetics is a period where key changes are made to the epigenetic profile of a given cell. For instance, there are 2 major sensitive periods in embryonic development: 1) the pre-implantation period (early development) and 2) the primordial germ cell development. During these periods old epigenetic profiles are erased in the zygote and primordial gametes, respectively, and new epigenetic marks are established throughout their genome, These new epigenetic profiles are needed to establish new functional programmes in these cells.</p>
<p>The previous information implies that it would not be advisable to receive any kind of epigentic treatment during pregnancy since t<span>reating patients during sensitive periods (pre-implantation and primordial germ cell development) might alter the normal epigenetic reprogramming of the developing baby. This could generate major developmental abnormalities in the individual.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal chromosome the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated in its imprinting control region (ICR). When ICR is not methylated the insulator protein CTCF binds ICR. CTCF is called an insulator because it prevents downstream enhancer sequences to loop towards the Igf2 gene (its preferred looping) to promote its expression. Therefore, the enhancers loop towards the long non-coding RNA gene H19 (second preferred looping), which is a reservoir of some miRNAs. In contrast, in the paternal chromosome the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in its imprinting control region (ICR) which prevents CTCF binding. This allows enhancers to increase Igf2 expression. Moreover, ICR's methylation spreads downstream to H19's promoter, silencing this gene. In Wilm's tumour there is an unbalance between the products of 2 linked loci, Igf2 (pro-oncogene) and Cdkn1c (tumor suppesor). Upregulation of Igf2 expression leads to overproliferation of cells in the kidney causing Wilm's tumour. This unbalance can be cause by different reasons: mutation, uniparental disomy and epigenetic disruption of these clusters. Methylation of the ICRs on the H19/Igf2 cluster in both parental chromosomes causes the overproduction of Igf2 in the cell which leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, methylation at CpG islands is involved in imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, gene silencing and the formation of heterochromatin. In cancer cells, CpG islands at gene promoters are usually hypermethylated. This hypermethylation at promoter's CpGs produces the silencing of diverse genes, including tumor suppesors which are crucial for controlling cell proliferation. Silencing of tumor suppresor genes contributes to cell cycle deregulation which leads to cancer.  </p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation<span> in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (e.g. satellite repeats)</span> is thought to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites of these regions, inhibit anisense transcription and direct RNA splicing. In cancer cells, repetitive elements such as satellite repeats are normally hypomethylated. This generates unspecific transcriptional activity at these sites, which contributes to genomic instability of the cell. Frequently, genomic instability precedes cancer.  </p></div>
