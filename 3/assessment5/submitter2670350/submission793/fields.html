    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) Normally DNA methylation of CPG islands tends to silence those areas for the gene expression.</p>
<p>2) In cancer the global level of methylation decreases when cancer develops, while the methylation of CpG usually islands increases. In normal cells, the CpG islands are usually hypometylathed. In cancer, there is notable increase in hypermethylation of CpG islands. </p>
<p>3) The hypermethylation of CpG islands usually occurs in cancer near the tumor supressor genes - this way the metylathion causes silencing of tumor supressors, and allwos tumor to grow. </p>
<p>4) In normal cells both repetitive elemens and intergenic regions are hypermethylathed and sometimes they are also packed in hetochromatine. This prevents from disfunctions in the genome like deletion, translocations etc,</p>
<p>5 and 6) When those different regions like repetetive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated - which happens in cancer cells, it can lead to hyperactivation of some genes - for example ranscriptional promotors become hypomethylated, and they become promoting transcription of a gene (or just the gene becomes hypomethylated and becomes active).As mentioned earlier this can lead to deletions, insertions or translocations thus contributing to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster we can have two sets of alleles - one from maternal and one from paternal side.</p>
<p>1) On paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated. Because of this, this site is silenced, and so is H19 site in the cluster (through spreading of methylation from the imprinted control region). Wen imprint controll region is silenced nothing will block te way for the enchancers, which will interact with Igf2 site thus promoting its transcription.</p>
<p>2) on maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated. When it is unmethylated, the protein, called CTCF can bind to it and sort of block the way to Igf2. When Igf2 is blocked the enchancers, which would normally promote the transcription of Igf2,bind to other sites - in this case to H19, thus promoting its transcripton. It is opposite then in paternal allele</p>
<p>3 and 4) Igf2 is a growth promoter. So if you overexpress Igf2 it can lead to uncontrolled growth. Also on the maternal side of the allele there is growth suppressor called Cdkn1c, which is silenced on the paternal allele.If something happens and we will end with no maternal allele and two paternal allele it will result in high Igf2 transcription and none Cdkn1c transcription - thus promoting growth and tumors (like Wilm's tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent - which means it can promote demethylation of parts of genome, reversing it and activating the tumor suppressors (it was used to cure the myeodysplastic syndromes which could lead to leukaemia). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable - which means that if we change for example the methylation of a cell, next time it divides, it will divide with changed epigenetic marks - thus removing methylation on tumor supressors would lead to such changes occuring in the next cells that will divide - and thus it will inhibit the whole tumor - w do it for one cell and all the other cells, which will divide from it will be cured as well. </p>
<p>2) Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reseting - those are periods in which the epigenetic marks of our parents are removed, and our individual set is being made. </p>
<p>3) There are two main sensitive periods - one during embrionic development and second during blastocyst development</p>
<p>4) Treating pateients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because those are the periods during which all our epigenetic machinery is being established - if we manipulated with additional DNA demethylating agents it could lead to hypometyhlation of our whole machinery -it is a sensitive period for a reason - we can unregulated our whole epigenetic machinery, thus leading to additional diseases (we would cure one, but could gain hundred more).</p></div>
