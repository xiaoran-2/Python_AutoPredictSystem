    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are DNA sequences that deviate significantly from the average genomic pattern by being GC- dinucliotide rich. Most (perhaps all )<span> act </span>as gene promoters.They <span>are usually</span> unmethylated, this makes the chromatine accessible to the transcription machinery and allows the gene to be expressed.</p>
<p>When a CpG island that promotes a tumor supressor gene becomes methylated, <span>its transcription</span> is inactivated and this can be one of the factors that leads this cell to an incontrolate proliferation.</p>
<p>Cpg island hypermethylation has been found in all the tumors <span>studied.</span> Different tumors can have hypermethylation at different CpG island sets.CpG island shores are the regions 2kb upstream or downstream the CpG island. <span>These</span> regions <span>are usually</span> unmethylated as the CpG islands in normal cells. There has been found also hypermethylation of the CpG island shores in tumor cells.</p>
<p>Most  of the DNA are repetitive elements and intergenic regions and <span>are usually </span>methylated..This methylation contributes to genomic stability preventing chromosome  rearrangements, retrotransposon movilization or activation of surrounding genes. This chromosome mutations can cause oncogenes activation or tumor suppressor genes inactivation.</p>
<p>In almost all tumors hypomethylation on repeat elements <span>and</span> intergenic regions has been found. This can increase genomic instability and/or activate tissue restricted genes, imprinted genes or micro RNAs.</p>
<p>The role of the DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent. There are cancers caused by a hypermethylation of gene tumor suppressor promoters and others <span>led </span>by a genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that acts inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). It is a nucleoside analogue that it is incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication.</p>
<p>When the DNMT1 comes to copy the methylation to the daughter strand gets bound irreversibly to decitabine and the daughter strand remains unmethylated..As the daugther strands will not be methylated “de novo”  a progressive demethylation on every cell division will occur.</p>
<p>So this kind of inhibition is division <span>depending which means </span>that cancer cells that are dividing much more rapidly than other cells of the body will be much more affected.. Tumors <span>led</span> by a DNA hypermethylation can be treated with this drug. Use of Decitabine has been approved for the  myelodisplastic syndrome treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are genes that, in normal conditions,  only one allele ( paternal or maternal ) is expressed. This is established in the germline and resists the embryonic epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>The expression of this genes is controlled by  the ICR (imprinted control region). Depending on the gene, methylation of the ICR leads to gene expression or not.</p>
<p>Igf2/H19 locus are imprinted genes. The paternal copy of H19 promoter is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is  unmethylated and expressed. The methylation of the H19 ICR blocks the union to this promoter of a protein (CTCF ) that insulate Igf2 of the action of enhancers ( Igf2 is upstream H19 and the enhancers are downstream). If this union is blocked, the enhancers can act over Igf2 and it can be expressed.</p>
<p>At the maternal allele, this ICR is not methylated, this allows the union of the CTCF, the enhancers act over H19 instead of Igf2  and IGF2 is silenced.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth factor so over expression of this gene can lead the cell to an uncontrolled division.</p>
<p>The abnormal methylation of the maternal allele produces double dose of Igf2,. It is known as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and can produce the Wilms tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">DNA methylation, as well as the other epigenetic marks,  needs to be removed  at the early embryonic development  to ensure the pluripotency of the cells of the new embryo. These epigenetic marks are laid down again throughout the development to ensure that different sets of genes are expressed in different cell types and/or in different development etapes.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">During the germ cells development, as the gametes need a particular set of genes to accomplish its function another epigenetic reprogramming happens.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">These two periods when the epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished are known as sensitive periods. Errors on epigenetic reprogramming can cause early embryonic lethality and tumours.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this means that any change will be transmitted to the daughter cells.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Treatments with drugs that alter DNA methylation  during these etapes can produce errors on the epigenetic reprogramming so these treatments are inadvisable in younger patients.</p>
