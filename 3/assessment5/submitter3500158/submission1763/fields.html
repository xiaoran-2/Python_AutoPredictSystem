    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally associated with gene silencing. CpG islands in promoter regions are usually not methylated (hypomethylation) in order to allow gene expression, but are methylated in silenced genes, for example on one allele during genetic imprinting. DNA methylation disruptions in cancer include locus specific hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. Hypermethylation tends to occur at CpG islands on tumor suppressor genes and also at imprint control regions (ICRs). Silencing of tumor suppressor genes negatively alters restriction of cell growth and proliferation, while hypermethylation of ICRs can result in changes in expression of factors which promote or restrict growth and proliferation, leading to a loss of imprinting. Hypomethylation can occur at CpG-poor promoter regions, resulting in activation of oncogenes, and at ICRs where imprinting in altered. These alterations in DNA methylation contribute to disease by affecting the ability of the cell to control cellular division and growth. The loss of regulation results in uncontrolled growth and proliferation, which are hallmarks of cancer.  </p>
<p>Genome wide hypomethylation also occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Under normal situations, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in order to be silenced and stop the transposons from replicating and being inserted in other regions of the chromosome. In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated, which allows expression and results in genomic instability. One example of how this occurs is a mutation in the gene the codes for DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), removing the ability to transfer information about methylation to daughter cells during division. Genomic instability can result in translocations, insertions, and deletions. These alterations contribute in many ways to disease, often resulting in over/under-expression of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal chromosome an imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, which blocks the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein) to the ICR. This results in spreading of the methylation to the promoter for the paternal H19 allele. This methylation silences the H19 gene on and allows downstream enhancers to activate the Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) gene. The paternal Igf2 allele is expressed and the paternal H19 allele is silenced.</p>
<p>On the maternal chromosome the ICR is not methylated, which allows the binding of CTCF. This results in the Igf2 allele being insulated from the downstream enhancers, instead allowing the enhancers to act on and activate the H19 allele. The maternal Igf2 allele is silenced and the maternal H19 allele is expressed.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor results from disruption of imprinting due to hypermethylation of the ICRs on both chromosomes, thus silencing H19 alleles and causing overexpression of Igf2. The overexpression of Igf2 can lead to tumor development.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting could result from either both ICRs becoming methylated or from their loss of methylation. These changes cause an overexpression of Igf2 when both ICRs are methylated and underexpression when methylation is lost. These changes can result in disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that falls in the class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine is responsible for the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, which results in hypomethylation. A common issue during tumor development is the hypermethylation of promoters for tumor suppressor genes. Since Decitabine causes demethylation by blocking DNMT, it inhibits the ability of the cell to pass the epigenetic marking to daughter cells, which leads to the expression of tumor suppressor genes. This results in the inhibition of further tumor development and death of some tumor cells through apoptosis (programmed cell death).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation can be passed down to daughter cells during cellular division, the epigenome in somatic cells remains constant until actively altered or erased. In situations where methylation is removed, or blocked from occurring in daughter cells during division, the epigenome is altered permanently, since there are no mechanisms to reinitiate the methylation. The effects on the epigenome last longer than the treatment period due to these factors. These long-lasting effects are also why treating patients with epigenetic altering drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times during development when cells are undergoing active epigenetic remodeling. Sensitive periods include early (pre-implantation) embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. If the epigenome is altered by medication during these periods, normal development would not be possible. A developing embryo exposed to this would most likely not survive, or have medical conditions if survival occurred. Primordial germ cells would also be affected indefinitely, possibly resulting in infertility of the individual later in life.   </p></div>
