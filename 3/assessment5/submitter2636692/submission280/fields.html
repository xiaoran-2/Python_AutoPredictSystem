    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation have been shown to be involved in cancer.</p>
<p>For instance, CpG islands are hypomethylated in healthy cells, effectively silencing the genes that are under the influence of that specific CpG island.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, this DNA methylation state is disrupted. In such cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. This of course increases expression of genes under the influence of that CpG island. In cancer, those genes frequently belong to the tumor suppressor gene family. Disturbances in the expression levels of tumor suppressor genes can untlimately lead to uncontrolled growth of cells, and thus tumor formation and cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also differentially methylated in healthy cells and cancer cells. Normally, these regions are hypermethylated to ensure genomic stability. These regions often contain transposable elements and/or cryptic promoters. Due to the hypermethylation, these regions are transciptionally silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these regions lose their DNA methylation and become hypomethylated. This allows transposable elements to become active, as well as enables cryptic promoters. Transposable elements and cryptic promoters may disrupt regular gene expression, leading to cancer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, hypomethylation of these regions can expose long repeats in the genome. If these are hypomethylated - and therefore in an open chromatin configuration - such regions may cause chromosomal recombination. This also possibly leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disrupted imprinting may lead to cancer, as can be seen in the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>Normally, the paternal allele is responsible for the expression of Igf2. The Imprint Control Region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents the insulator CTCF from binding. This in turn forces the nearby Enhancers to stimulate Igf2 expression as well as prevents H19 expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR, so CTCF can bind. CTCF prevents the Enhancers from acting on Igf2 expression, but in stead stimulate H19 expression.</p>
<p>In summary, the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and the maternal allele expresses H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, imprinting is disrupted in a way that the maternal allele is also methylated at the ICR. This means that it behaves as a paternal allele, expression Igf2 in stead of H19.</p>
<p>A increases dose of Igf2, a growth-factor, can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that can be used to treat certain cancers. It is a DNA demethylating agents that acts on DNA methyltransferases and inhibits them. In summary, Decitabine reduces DNA methylation.</p>
<p>At the right dosage, Decitabine works by incorporating itself into the DNA. If a DNA methyltransferase then tries to demethylate the DNA, it is irreversibly bound to the Decitabine. This captures the DNA demethylase and prevents it from further actions. As DNA methylation is normally passed on through cell division, this effectively leads to global demethylation of the DNA over time. Especially so in cancer cells, as these divide rapidly - this leads to a faster rate of DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>At high dosage, Decitabine has been shown to be very toxic and induce cell-death. This also helps in reducing tumor-size.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are certain periods in which it is advised not to treat patients with drugs that affect the epigenetic state.</p>
<p>First of all, it is important to remember that epigenetic drugs act systemically, i.e. on all cells in the body. Secondly, epigenetic changes are heritable through cell division, which means that changes in epigenetics are passed onto daughter-cells and can have long-lasting effects long after the drug has been administered.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider sensitive periods. In sensitive periods there is increased epigenetic remodeling. There are two sensitive periods; first, the period of primordial germ cell development, including to the production of mature eggs and sperm. Second, the pre-implanted and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Considering all of the above, treating someone during a sensitive period can have grave and long-lasting effects. Cells are highly susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming during these sensitive periods and epigenetic drugs might do more harm than good in promoting or inhibiting certain aspects of the epigenetic machinery during this period. Such changes would be passed on to daughter-cells and therefore can have an effect even after the initial drug treatment. In young patients, this is far from ideal.</p></div>
