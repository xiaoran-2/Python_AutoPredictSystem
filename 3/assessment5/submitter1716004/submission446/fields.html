    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells processes (e.g. cell differentiation, imprinting and  X Chromosome Inactivation) a dynamic DNA-methylation between different cell types occurs to lead a normal development in the organism, usually the CpG islands (promoter gene region) are unmethylated allowing the expresion of functional genes. Furthermore to maintain the genomic stability (karyotype, transcription start sites and splicing sites) in normal cells, the DNA-methylation silence the intergenic regions and introns (preventing deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, transcriptional interference and abnormal splicing).  Also the genomic integrity is lead by DNA-methylation, through the silence of repetitive elements (preventing mutagenic transpositions, genomic disruption, transcriptional interference and ilegitimate recombination).   </p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands and shores of some tumour supressor genes promoters (e.g. RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT ) and some imprinting control regions (ICR´s) are silenced by DNA-hypermethylation in specific locus, this disruption progess with tumorigenicity and leads to loss of imprinting, genomic instability, epimutations and finally aberrant overgrowth of cells (neoplasia and invasion). However in cancer cells also the genome-wide is DNA-hypomethylated (e.g. repetitive elements, CpG poor promoters, intergenic regions, introns and some ICR´s). The hypomethylation of repeats and intergenics regions produce genome instability (ilegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition,deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, disruption to neighbouring genes, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters). The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters leads to activation of oncogenic genes expression (e.g. R-RAS, miR21 targeting -PTEN- a tumour supresor gene). In this context the hypermethylation of CpG islands-shores and hypomethylation of genome-wide allows aberrant responses of genes and consequently results in cancer development trought specific tissues. Finally the DNA-Methylation in cancer is context dependent (different tumours have different dependencies), additionally this dependencies is stage especific in each tumour complicating the scene for medical treatments. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF (insulator protein) binding, the CTCF insulate the Igf2 gene from dowstream enhancers (silencing the expression), this mechanism allows the expression of H19 gene by enhancers. On the other hand in the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) and the H19 gene are methylated (silencing the expression and avoiding the insulator effects of CTCF), furthermore the Igf2 gene is unmethylated and available allowing the expression by dowstream enhancers. In this way the paternal allele express Igf2 and the maternal allele express H19 in normal cells.  </p>
<p>In the maternal allele of Wilm´s tumour cells (childhood kidney tumour), the ICR and H19 gene are hypermethylated allowing the expression of Igf2 by enhancers (imprinting disruption), while in the paternal allele the expresion of Igf2 is maintained normally. This imprinting disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster results in a double dose of Igf2, promoting the aberrant cellular overgrowth in the childhood kidney, the loss of imprinting is directly asociated with Wilm´s tumour and could be observe in preneoplastic tissues (before frank tumour), the early detection of imprinting disruption could lead to early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (nucleoside analog) is a DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitor (direct action against DNA methylation) and is classified as "antimetabolite-DNA demethylating agent", this prodrug can be incorporated into DNA strands but no into RNA and the effects occurred predominantly in CpG islands and shores at chromosome subtelomeric regions. The activation of this prodrug is via phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and after activation is incorporated into DNA. </p>
<p>In cancer cells the hypermetilation of CpG islands is present (e.g. silencing tumour suppressor genes), the decitabine act directly in the DNMT trapping and degradation, DNA repair, synthesis and hypomethylation, this actions can reactivate the normal functions of the genes controling the aberrant overgrowth of cells. In several studies the Decitabine demonstrated clinical properties as a potent antineoplastic supressor, actually is approved by FDA (US food and drug administration) against myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The dividing cells are highly suceptible to the epigenetics drugs, in cancer tissues the cells are dividing many times more than normal, so aberrant cells have the most of these drugs with higher concentrations around, allowing a differential effects of the drugs between healthy and cancer cells. These DNA-methylation effects can be passed through cancer cells generations because in adults (not a sensitive period) is difficult to modify the epigenetics marks and probably the hypermethylation pattern of cancer cell are actively erased without return in time. This suggest that epigenetic drugs have a large effect on cancer in a long lasting way.  </p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the environment can influence the epigenetic control in a organism, in the sensitive periods of mammals (preimplantation, early postimplantation, primordial germ cell development until production to mature eggs and sperm) an active reprogramming of epigenome occurs removing and laying down epigenetics marks, in these periods the cancer treatments with epigenetic drugs can directly disrupt the normal DNA-methylation patterns, altering the normal development and the inheritance through the gametes, this is the principal reason because this kind of treatments is inadvisable and must to be avoid for children and pregnant women.  </p></div>
