    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG Islands are normally protected from methylation. CpG Islands are normally at the promoters of genes. They are also normally methylated in inactive X chromosome.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted by the CpG Islands (and CpG Island shores) becoming hypermethylated.</p>
<p>CpG Island methylation contributes to cancer by silencing tumour suppressor genes. They stop different tumour suppressor genes in colorectal cancer, gliomas, and neuroblastomas.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to prevent genomic instability.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA in intergenic regions becomes demethylated.</p>
<p>DNA demethylation of intergenic regions and repeats causes activation of repeats, transposition of parts of genes between chromosomes, and insertions and deletions of parts of genes.<br />Many cancers have instances of genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has the ICR methylated, and H19 methylated which enables activation of the downsteam enhancers which cause lgf2 to be expressed.</p>
<p>The maternal allele has the ICR bound by CTCF, and H19 demethylated which blocks activation of the downsteam enhancers so lgf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR region is methylated so CTCF cannot bind there and the H19 region is methylated in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In cancer, H19 is deactivated in the maternal allele which enables the enhancers to activate lgf2 in the maternal allele.<br />Since the paternal allele already has an active lgf2, too much lgf2 is produced which causes a kidney tumour to grow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent (Denovo methyltransferase inibitor - DNMTi).</p>
<p>Decitabine demethylates DNA genes throughout the body.</p>
<p>Some of the genes Decitabine demethylates are tumour suppressor genes so they can stop cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When the Cytosine (C) in CG base pairs in DNA becomes methylated, both strands have methylated CG pairs (CpG).<br />When these strands of DNA are copied (when the cell divides into two cells) they become two hemi-methylated strands which DNMT1 then methylates the non-methylated strands.Therefore, one strand of DNA with CpG is converted into two strands of DNA with CPG so the methylation of CGs is mitotically inherited into the daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when the DNA methylation pattern (epigenetics) is reprogrammed (removed and re-established with a new pattern).</p>
<p>A sensitive period is the pre-implanation period from when a sperm fertilizes an egg and the time it grows to become a Blastocyst.<br />Another sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development when the germs cells are created (sperm or egg) in the embryo.<br />Another sensitive period is when a child goes through puberty.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods is inadvisable because it could cause the epigenetic marks to be disrupted from their normal conditions<br /> because they are in the process of being removed and reprogrammed during the sensitive periods.</p>
