    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic Imprinting is a genetic phenomenon by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent of origin specific manner. The imprinted alleles can be expressed either from the maternal allele (e.g. H19) or from the paternal allele (e.g. IGF2). Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic prosses that involves DNA methylation and histone modulation.</p>
<p>The H19/IGF2 cluster is an example of genomic imprinting and how the disruption of this cluster can contribute to cancer. We have two methylation patterns of this cluster, the maternal allele which is unmethylated on the ICR (the CTCF protein binds ICR) and it expresses H19 non coding RNA and the paternal allele which is methylated (the CTCF protein doesn't bind ICR) nad it expresses IGF2 protein. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour (childhood kidneys tumour) we have loss of imprinting and this results in  hypermethylation of the maternal allele. That means that the maternal allele is also expressing IGF2  (overexpression of IGF2 - double dose). This overexpression of IGF2 in comparisson to normal (imprinted) cells contributes to Wilm's tumour (IGF2 is a growth promoting factor). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug (a cytidine analog) used for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and is classified as a DNA methylotransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), that means that causes changes in DNA methylation in neoplasia. It spesifically targets DNMT1 and that results in DNA hypomethylation. This DNA hypomethylation is caused because  DNMT1 binds this nucleotide in order to copy the methylation but it can no longer be released. This DNMTi are cell division dependent so this drug can only effect cells that are are replicating (cancer cells are being replicated more rapidly than other cells). So non proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine. DNA hypermethylation can result in the blockage of the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. Decitabine induction of hypomethylation in cancer cells may restore normal function to tumor suppressor genes and that means that it can restore control over cell growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification and can occur at CpG islands, at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements. CpG islands are usually at promoters of the genes and tend to be unmethylated. Methylation of the CpG islands usually silences the gene. The gene expression is caused by changing the chromatin structure (repressive chromatin) or by exlusion of the transcription factors (prohibit transcription factor binding). On the other hand, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements tend to be methylated and they maintain genomic integrity.</p>
<p>DNA's methylation profile can change and this can lead to an abnormal condition. One of this conditions is cancer (epimutations). Epimutations can occur at CpG islands via the methylation of the CpG islands. Hypermethylation results in loss of expression and CpG islands are located within gene promoters regions and especially at promoters of tumour suppressor genes. The normal fuction of this genes is to suppress the tumour so when we silense them through methylation this leads to cancer. </p>
<p>Another change in the methylation profile is the genome-wide hypomethylation. The effects of the hypomethylation depends on the location of the hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of the repetetive elements and the intergenic regions can lead to genomic instability and the hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters can lead to oncogene activation. So hypomethylation contributes to oncogenesis by activation of oncogenes or by actovation of latent transposons or by chromosome instability. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering of DNA methylation can effect the epigenome by gene silencing, gene expression or genomic instability. The periods of pre - implatation development and germ cell development is called sensitive period. If we treat patients with drugs for epigenetic modifications during sensitive periods this could be dangerous and harmful for their childrean. We know that drugs for epimutations eg inhibitors of DNA methyation can effect not only cancer cells but also normal cells and this can effect the genomic imprinting. All this can lead to perinatal malprogramming which has been related to eg metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases. </p></div>
