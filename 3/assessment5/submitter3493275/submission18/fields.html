    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is generally low at CpG islands and CpG island shores in normal cells.  Normally hypomethylated CpG islands are promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  In cancer, CpG islands (and shores) are hypermethylated and this can silence tumor suppressor genes and allow uncontrolled growth to occur.  The DNA rmethylation is mitotically heritable and epigenetic mutations may be selected for rapidly, giving the abnormal cell a competitive advantage. CpG island DNA methylation shows progression from a pre-neoplastic state to invasive growth or metastasis in cancer. The pattern of CpG island hypermethylation is, both singlely and in sets, cancer type specific.  CpG island hypermethylation has been found in retinoblastoma, colonic cancer, breast cancer and gliomas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in normal cells, the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns are generally methylated.  In cancer cells, these areas are hypomethylated by comparision and reflective of generally genome-wide hypomethylation.  The outcome of DNA hypomethylation depends on where the hypomethylation occurs.  It happens to some extent in all tumors and it occurs early and progresses.  The DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability.  This leads to illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions and activation of cryptic promoters.  The results include reciprocal translocations, insertions and deletions.  These disruptions can affect neighboring genes by interrupting or promoting their function inappropriately.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters has been shown to activate an oncogene, R-RAS, in gastric cancer.  In addition, hypomethylation of a  CpG poor promoter has been shown to activate a micro RNA (miR21) in glioma.  Then miR21 silences a tumor suppressor gene, (PTEN).  These are examples of how hypomethylation can contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which is incorporated into the DNA.  This then irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase during replication.  It is uncertain at this time if this is the drug's only effect as there is a lack of specificity to its mechanism of action.  The overall effect is a decrease in DNA methylation.  This may be why it can be effective in hematologic malignancies, which are dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation.  That is, removing the hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor gene, would allow that gene to be expressed and inhibit the malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint Control Regions often involve processes related to growth.  Growth can occur by decreasing growth restriction or increasing growth promotion.  Cancer cells show a loss of imprinting and the result is what appears to be double expression or complete silencing of the gene involved.  The ICR of the paternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally methylated.  Therefore, CTCF cannot bind.  This silences H19, and the enhancers cause increased expression of Igf2, leading to growth.  The corresponding maternal allele is generally not methylated.  In this case, CTCF is bound, causing H19 to be expressed and Igf2 to be silenced, inhibiting growth.  In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting on the maternal allele, causing it to become methylated and act as a second paternal allele.  As a result, CTCF is not bound, Igf2 is expressed and  growth is excessively promoted.  These changes are found very early in the neoplastic process.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epitenetically induced alterations in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable to future cell generations.  Therefore, epigenetic drugs may alter tumor cells in a way that also effects the daughter and granddaughter cells.  If an epigenetic change was made that now allowed a tumor suppressor gene to be expressed or a promotor of an oncogene to be silenced, the tumor's growth might be significantly inhibited.  It is imaginable that epigenetic changes could occur which might make cells more susceptible to the effects of standard chemotherapy and that this vulnerability could be passed on to future tumor cells.  </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those times when the epigeneitc marks are most susceptible to being changed by outside factors.  The major sensitive periods are during primordial  germ cell development and early embryonic life prior to implantation.  Because epigenetic drugs are not typically locus site specific in their actions, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.  The effects of the treatment might not be fully predictable, they might occur over the entire genome and they could be inherited over many future generations.</p></div>
