    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation is an epigenetic mark which inversely correlates with gene expression except at CpG islands where methylation allows the expression of the genes. In a normal cell there is no methylation of CpG islands, but there is methylation in the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes. The epigenome of cancer cells show numerous alterations, and changes in DNA methylation are included, there is a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. The consequences of these changes are genomic insatbility and deregulation of tissue specifc and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of the tumour suppressor genes by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. For the repetitive and the intergenic regions there is a loss of methylation in cancer cells, they are unlikely to be methylated. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it is thought it may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. Cancer cells are unable to perfom these actions when DNA methylation is altered.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark, so the result in one cell for treatment can benefit the following offsprings of the cell when the epigenetic treatment regulates methylation. However there might be sensitive periods of the cell where it may not be advisable to use any treatment with drugs or very strong chemicals despite their effectiveness; these periods may refer to the stages when the cell is more susceptible to environmental insults and external responses. The sensitive periods may normally occur in germ cells and embryonic stem cells, early stages of the cell were differentiation has not yet occurr and where epigenetic reprogramming is being executed. It has to be taken into account that the cell in its sensible periods won´t have the same responses as a normal cell would, environmental insults are more likely to affect the cell during this periods and the use of drugs or chemicals for treatment may result hazardous for the cell instead of beneficial during these stages as they may greatly affect the genetic and epigenetic code in a more direct way which then will later turn into mutations or aberrations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Commonly cancer cells display loss of imprinting. Cells that should be imprinted no longer show imprinted expression but instead become expressed form both prental alleles or silenced form both parental alleles.  Hypermethylation of ICR results in Igf2 overexpression in Wilm´s Tumour ( a type of kidney cancer). Normally in the cell the imprint control region would be methylated from the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele; CTCF would be the insulator on the maternal allele and the enhancers would act on H19 and Igf 2 would be silenced. On the paternal allele enhancers can act on Igf2 then it would be active. With the overexpression in cancer the result would be given as having two paternal alleles, you would be having a double dose of Igf2 and since Igf2 is growth promoting, growth will certainly be affected by this double dose.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor use to treat myelodisplatic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. As its class suggests it, Decitabine is nucleoside analog. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind to that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strands, so normal methylation marks are restablished.  The DNA methyltransferase involved in the process is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released; it is also replication dependent. Cancer cells that are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells will be more severly affected because of this last mentioned characteristic. </p></div>
