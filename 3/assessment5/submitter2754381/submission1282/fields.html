    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of 5´ group of cytosines within CpG islands occurs at dinucleotides in mammals by a methyltransferase in a symmetrical way, so as to be maintained through cell division. It occurs often at promoters of genes although CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. The methylation of CpG islands provokes silencing of gene expression by two mechanisms: it´s associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or it can prohibit transcription factor binding. In a normal cell there is no methylation at CpG islands, instead the genome is methylated at repetitive elements, the intergenic region an in introns of genes. On the other hand, in a cancer cell, CpG islands are methylated and the genome is hypomethylated. The methylation of CpG islands in cancer are in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, silencing them. And also, hypermethylation is frequently in tumors, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it progress with the tumor. Also the hypermethylation varies with the tumor type and progresses with age and with the tumor development and grow. This is why the accumulation of these epigenetic mistakes can contribute to the development of cancer, and perhaps, in some time of our lives, everyone is going to suffer from cancer.</p>
<p>As mention above, DNA methylation in normal cells occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. It´s function is to maintain genomic integrity, because it is involved in silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombination and in the silence of cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions produces genomic instability by illegitimating recombination between repeats, activating repeats and transposition and activating cryptic promoters and disrupting neighbouring genes. Chromosomal instability and hypomethylations enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted gene expression is modified in cancer too. Cluster H19/Igf2 has maternal and paternal alleles with a different methylation pattern. Maternal allele is not methylated because insulator protein (CTFC) binds to ICR, so H19 gene expression is active meanwhile Igf2 expression is silence. On the other hand, paternal allele is methylated, CTCF can´t bind and it results in the enhancer activation of IgF2 expression, and the silencing of H19. In this way, there is an imprinted gene expression that allows maternal and paternal differences in expression patterns. In Wilm´s tumour, occurs a hypermethylation of ICRs generating complete loss of imprinting. The hypermethylation of both parental alleles has direct consequences on Igf2 expression, that is going enhanced twice its normal levels. This happens because methylation doesn´t allow CTFC bind and the enhancer allows expression of Igf2 but H19 expression would be silence.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA upon replication and then when DNA methyl transferase is incorporated and binds to it makes a copy of the methylation to the daughter strand. This binding is irreversible making it division dependent. In low doses, it has been prove to produce DNA demethylation and have anti-neoplastic effects as a consequence. Although it´s mechanism of action is still unclear, it has work out in haematological malignancies dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, perhaps because it depends on cell division. Yet is not clear what would be the long term effects on normal cells, because as it action is on DNMTs, it is possible that it affects normal cells also.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. That is the main reason why it might be possible that an epigenetic therapy can have enduring effects on the epigenome. A sensitive period is a key window of development during which an insult may have an impact in future life. In mammals the sensitive periods include since primordial germ cells until the production of gametes, and then the pre-implantation and post-implantation period. During these sensitive periods, an insult can have effects on epigenetic control, and it also can produce transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Cancer is not the only case in which we can find epigenetic abnormalities, and, as in the case of other epigenetic abnormalities, we have to keep in mind that drugs targeting epigenetic machinery would affect any type of cells, including normal cells. This is the reason why it should be advisable not to treat with this drugs patients which are a sensitive periods where environment can have long lasting effects on epigenetic machinery. </p></div>
