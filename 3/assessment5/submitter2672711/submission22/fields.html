    <h1>Submission 22 from Anon (session_user_id: 1c665e1ff53db0b5faf66151261ab6e5936cc3c1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is approved for MDS syndrome, a blood disorder characterized by abnormal differentiation of blood cells and hypermethylation.  Decitabine belongs to the inhibitors of DNA  methyltransferases (DNMT), regulators of  DNA methylation.  As a nucleoside, decitabine incorporates into the DNA cell genome and traps/inhibits the DNMTs; thus further methylation is inhibited.  DNA structural instability, degradation of DNMT and obstruction of DNA synthesis are the results.  Since Decitabine blocks the function of the DNMTs, the methylation level in daughter cells is reduced.  Abnormal DNA methylation patterns, both hypo and hyper, have been identified in MDS and solid tumors.  In MDS, aberrant DNA hypermethylation at promoter regions lead to a decrease in transcription and silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  Demethylating agents are useful to reverse the silencing of these critical tumor suppressor genes, resulting in an anti-tumor effect. Decitabine de-represses the inappropriately silenced genes and restores their normal functions.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR and H19 are methylated blocking the binding of the insulator protein CTCF and silencing the H19 expression and allowing enhancers to promote Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR (blocked by CTCF, an insulator protein)  and H19 are not methylated; thus the H19 is subject to enhancers and is expressed. </p>
<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR and the H19 becomes hypermethylated just as seen in the paternal allele causing the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele and imprinting is disrupted. This methylation on both the paternal and maternal ICR contributes to Igf2 overexpression and tumor proliferation.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are important factors in embryonic growth, placental growth and adult metabolism and monallelic expression assures that these factors are properly regulated.  If not,  and there is an alternation of DNA methylation at the ICRs, then both parent alleles become either expressed or silenced.  Alternation in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hyper) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting or over expression of growth promoting genes resulting in  in development abnormalities and disease.   For example, aberrant imprinting is seen in colon and other cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns, either normal or altered, are usually permanent, unidirectional, mitotially inheritable and potentially inherited transgenerationally via the gametes, thus exhibiting an enduring effect on the epigenome<strong>.   </strong>These features can explain how early life exposures can last for a life time.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in an organism’s life is a time period with increased sensitivity to the effects of exposure with resulting changes in the epigenome as for instance in fetal or early postnatal periods when organs are rapidly developing. Two very sensitive periods are the two waves of epigenetic re-programming:  early development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Maternal and paternl genomes go two rounds of re-programming while imprinted genes one round (PGC)</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as the DNA is growing and epigenetic programming including DNA methylation can be disrupted. Exposure during a critical window of development can be linked to later abnormalities due to loss of genomic imprinting, etc.  Also, future generations can be affected if drugs are given during a sensitive period.   For instance, if a pregnant women is treated, three generations could potentially be affected, the pregnant women, her developing baby and the primordial germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal functions of DNA methylation at CpG islands/shores include genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, regulation of gene expression, maintenance of genome integrity by DNA-protein stabilization and interacting with other molecular entities to condense chromatin making genes less accessible. In normal cells, CpG Island which are found usually in promoters of genes are hypomethylated.  However, there is methylation at repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and the introns of genes. DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer cells as the islands are more likely to be methylated, and the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns of genes hypomethylated. Specific methylation patterns allows for cell differentiation, proliferation and maintenance of cell identity.  Thus, disrupting these methylation patterns such as hypomethylation can lead to diseases such as cancer by altering expression patterns of DNA repair genes, tumor suppressor genes, and oncogenes ie RAS in gastric cancer.  On the other hand, dense methylation of Cpg islands, particularly in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes is associated with aberrant silencing of transcription leading to imprinting abnormalities and disease.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA  methylation at intergenic/repetitive regions is to maintain genomic integrity to prevent deletions/insertions, to silence cryptic transcription start/splice sites, to silence repeats to prevent transposition and subsequent transcriptional interference from strong promoter, and to prevent illegitimate recombination.  ( DNA methylation is mutagenic to protect the genome from transposable elements.)   CpG methylation frequently occurs at repeated sequences in the genome and is involved in the suppression of transcriptional activity and immobility of transposable elements such as intracisternal A particles. In cancer in these regions, there is hyomethylation (thus less dense chromatin structure) at intergenic/repititive sites leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring gene, ie. Avy. These abnormalities can lead to human disease ie ICF syndrome.</p>
