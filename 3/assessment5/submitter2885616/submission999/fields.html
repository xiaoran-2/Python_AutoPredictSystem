    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>~Silencing of gene expression.  </p>
<p>~In the case of cancer is that the intergenic intervals and their repetitive elements now tend to be unmethylated. </p>
<p>~If the normal CpG islands methylated or unmethylated is changed,it will discrupt the normal expression of gene expression,which produces abnormal protein which causes diseases.</p>
<p>~I<span>n intergenic regions and repetitive elements.，it maintains genomic integrity.<span><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>~</span></span></span>DNA methylation is hypomethylation at the intergenic intervals. And the repetitive elements actually lead to or help to bring about that genomic instability in the instances of cancer.</p>
<p>~If the normal intergenic regions and repetitive elements methylated or unmethylated is changed,it will discrupt the normal expression of gene expression,which produces abnormal protein which causes diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The imprinted control region unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele, and this means it's paternally imprinted.It's insulating IGF2 these enhancers are now free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.On the patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can now no longer bind.And if CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2.And promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele.And therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele. </p>
<p>Uniparental disomy means that chromosome,in this case chromosome 11 is inherited in two copies from the father so that would be uni, uniparental paternal disomy, as is shown for Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. </p>
<p>What Igf2 does is it promotes growth, it's an oncogene.What happens is that you have effectively appearance of two paternal like alleles</p>
<p>and loss of the maternal like allele.So this then means if you lose this allele and you end up having two alleles that look like this one then you get too much Igf2. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being established.</p>
<p>The period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms seems to be one sensitive period.The second sensitive period is the pre-implanted and early post implantation period shown here. </p>
<p>Perhaps they don't escape this global epigenetic re-programming.But rather there is some sort of messenger molecule, and this messenger</p>
<p>molecule might be the molecule that itself is found in the germ cells and being transmitted through the gametes.But that will then lead on to the establishment of different epigeneticmarks.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>~DNA-demethylating agent</p>
<p><span><span>It will show that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them). And, second, some of the participants who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p>
