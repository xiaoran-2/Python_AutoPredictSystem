    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, but when methylation occurs, it will probably lead to silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>Also inactive X chromosome shows DNA methylation of CpG islands.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. So there's hypermethylation of CpG islands, and hypomethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns.</p>
<p>The CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, and in cancer, when there is hypermethylation of these CpG islands, these promoters of tumor suppressor genes is silenced. Silencing a tumor suppressor gene is going to allow the cancer cells to have an advantage over the others cells of the tissue, and over a period of time the cells that have the epimutation will divide more rapidly or will not die as much as the others cells, and they will take over.</p>
<p>Inntergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity, and avoid deletions, insertions, duplications or reciprocal translocations. DNA methylation at intergenic regions also silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability, the DNA methylation silence the repetitive elements to prevent mutagenic transposition, it can also mutate methyl cytosines into thymines to prevent mutagenic transposition. Silencing of these repetitive elements will also avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylations of the repeats prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements or intergenic regions will lead to genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern of the paternal allele is methylated in the H19/Igf2 cluster, because of its methylation, CTCF can no longer bind to the cluster, then there will be no insulator action to Igf2, then the enhancers are free to act on Igf2, and Igf2 will be expressed in the paternal allele, and H19 will not. H19 will not be expressed because of the methylation spreading, the methylation that's found at the imprint control region can spread downstream into the H19 promoter, and when it's methylated, it's silenced, because it's a CpG island promoter.</p>
<p>The pattern of the maternal allele is unmethylated in the H19/Igf2. The long non coding RNA H19 is produced only in the maternal allele, because the cluster in unmethylated. The cluster which is unmethylated is bound by a insulator protein called CTCF, and this protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, and when Igf2 is insulated, these enhancers are free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele. Although the preferred chromatin loop is between the enhancers and Igf2, when CTCF blocks this by its binding to the cluster, the secondary preference will occur. And H19 will be expressed, while Igf2 will not.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>This drug exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and incorporation into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. In neoplastic cells, hypomethylation may restore the normal function to genes that are important for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. <span>In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotic heritable, so once you have DNA methylation in DNA, all its daughter cells will have the same methylation. This helps to maintain cell identity and tissue homogeneity. Once you have a methylation on your DNA, the daughter cells will have one strand with the methylation, DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 because hemi-methylated DNA is the substrate for DNMT1.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those which altered environments have an affect on epigenetic control, any environmental change can be transgenerationally heritable. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are: the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through the production of mature eggs or sperms and the pre implanted and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>It's inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because the drugs can cause an affect in the offspring, because it can change its DNA methylation.</p>
