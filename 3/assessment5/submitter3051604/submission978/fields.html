<p><span>CpG islands,usually unmethylated, are found at gene promoters and their genes are expressed. However, in some cases, like X inactivation, the CpG islands are methylated. This causes condensed chromatin and gene silencing. DNA methylation varies according to tissue type because different genes need to be expressed, eg skin v blood. Such differences are epigenetic and mitotically heritable so methylation is passed on to daughter cells. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>In cancer the CpG islands at various loci are frequently hypermethylated and it increases with tumorgenicity. If tumour suppressor genes are therefore silenced, cells may rapidly grow and divide, the aberrant DNA epigenetic mark will be favoured and the tumour will take over. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>In disease, methylation of CpG islands is more common than mutation. It differs with tumour type and even individual and it makes useful biomarkers to diagnose diseases and whether a tumour is benign or not. The prognosis for a disease may be indicated by the prescence of CpG island hypermethylation on a particular gene, helping choice of treatment. CpG island epigenetic mistakes are potentially reversible indicating possible therapies. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>The genome consists mainly of the regions between genes and the repetitive elements. Here DNA is normally methylated to silence the dangerous repeats and transposons. The fact that DNA methylation is mutagenic is balanced by the need for genomic stability. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>In cancer these regions are often hypomethylated and this occurs in all types of cancer. Hypomethylation of the genome as a whole increases with tumorgenicity. It can lead to genomic instability eg the activation of repeats, deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocation as well as disruption to neighbouring genes. Oncogenes can be activated. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>Hypomethylation genomic instability is seen in human cancers and in mouse studies where Dnmt1 has been deleted in certain tissues leading to cancer. Hypomethylation varies with type and stage of disease. </span></p>

<p><span>Genomic imprinting is monoallelic gene expression based on parent of origin. It is associated with DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs). An example of imprinted genes exists on human chromosome 11 at cluster H19/Igf2 and involves an enhancer blocker. This is normally paternally imprinted. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>Normally the male allele ICR DNA is methylated which stops the binding of the enhancer blocker CTCF. DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter silencing the gene. Downstream enhancers then activate Igf2 (a growth promoter). </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>The female allele is normally unmethylated at the ICR, the CTCF binds, the downstream enhancers are unable to access Igf2 so instead enhance the H19 gene which is expressed (a growth suppressor). </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>Wilm</span><span>ʼ</span><span>s tumour is a kidney diease suffered mainly by children. Here the maternal allele is also methylated at the ICR so both alleles behave like the normal male allele resulting in double Igf2 (growth promoter) and no H19(growth suppressor). Wilm's tumour is one disease of </span>the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. </p>
                                               
<p><span>Parent of origin specific epigenetic marks are cleared an</span>d reset in germ cell development and then maintained. Mistakes in imprinting and the diseases caused can be inherited, not sex specifically but by parent of origin. </p>

<p><span>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor. It is a DNA demethylating agent, inhibiting DNA methyltransferase enzymes. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>It is used to treat blood disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is not useful for all types of cancer, especially solid tumours. MDS occurs in old age and maybe due to the accumulation of epigenetic mistakes. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>Decitabine induces demethylation in neoplastic cells which appears to reactivate tumour suppressor genes( hypermethylated in MDS) and restores epigenetic regulation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds with DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, which happens at cell division. Rapidly dividing cancer cells are most affected. In the 1970s high doses were found to be toxic but low doses kill tumour cells when DNA demethlylation appears highest. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>The way it works is still not clear, systemic use causes worries about its long term effects, particularly on younger patients and pregnant women. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:

<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.

<p><span>The epigenome controls expression or silencing of genes on DNA in a particular cell. Skin and blood cells have different epigenomes. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark which is mitotically heritable so a change in this will be inherited for a lifetime and in some cases by future generations. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed e.g. when DNA methylation is at its lowest and chromatin is more open. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>For the genome as a whole these periods are during early development and at the development of the primordial germ cells. The least sensitive period is during somatic cell maintenance. However the exceptions to this are that imprinted genes do not show a decrease in DNA methylation during early development and repeats show little change in DNA methylation during the whole life cycle. </span></p>
                                               
<p><span>Treating patients with drugs to alter the epigenome at sensitive periods would be inadvisable because both normal and abnormal cells would be exposed to the drug and effects are not fully understood. During these sensitive periods, alterations or removal of the normal process of epigenetic reprogramming can cause epigenetic abnormalities resulting in disease and cancer for an individual and possibly their offspring. </span></p>
