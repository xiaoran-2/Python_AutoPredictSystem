    <h1>Submission 1047 from Anon (session_user_id: 7bebf12c2de4f802d00331fc914d443536dba5be)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island usually means silencing of gene expression by prohibiting transcription factor binding, and altering gene expression. Due to the disruption of <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNMT1</span> in cancer cell, CpG island are usually hypermethylated and therefore leading to silence of tumour supressor genes in cancer. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements control the expression of nearby genes. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes genomic instability. This leads to illegitimate recombinations such as deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions in the genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Maternal allele has repressed Igf2, unmethylated ICR, and maternally expressed H19 gene while paternal allele has active Igf2, methylated ICR, and repressed methylated H19 gene. For the maternal allele, CTCF binded to unmethylated ICR is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers but enhance H19 expression. For the paternal allele, enhancers enhance Igf2 expression because of the methylated ICR. Wilm’s tumour is caused by disruption of H19/Igf2 cluster in which the maternal allele behaves like paternal allele. This can be caused by mutation, deletion, uniparental disomy, or epigenetic disruption. As CTCF cannot insulate Igf2 from enhancers anymore, these disruptions lead to upregulation of Igf2 which is the oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an DNMT inhibitor. They are n<span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">ucleoside analogues and bind to DNMTs. Decitabine causes DNA methylation but it is not selective and may affect the normal cell. Its effectiveness is due to the high replication rate of cancer cells compared with that of normal cells. Hence this suppresses the growth of tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods, i.e. <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">primordial germ cell development and early development</span></span>. In these periods, altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. These epigenetic marks are transmitted from parent to offspring. The mechanisms and implications epigenetic drugs are unclear. For example, pregnanted patients are not advisable as the molecules may transfer to the babies through circulatory system.</p></div>
