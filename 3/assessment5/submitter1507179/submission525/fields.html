    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When CpG islands in the promoter of a gene are hypermethylated, it is likely that the gene will be supressed. In normal cells, most promoters are unmethylated, but when a tumor supressing proteins have hypermethylated promoters, then they won't be expressed leading to a higher chance of a tumor forming. Since CpG island methylation is mitotically heritable, it is a stable marker that will continue the tumor causing properties along the daughter line, leading to the cancer spreading. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In intergenic regions, normally, the DNA is methylated, which leads to a densly packed heterochromatin. This means that those regions are unlikely to be transcribed. In a cancerous cell, however the case is that often repetitive elements and intervenic regions are unmethylated. When repetitive regions are unmethylated, they form open chromatin, and are more likely to interfere with other repetitive elements resulting in genomic instability. It is also possible that a faulty transcription or translation of an intergenetic/repetitive element can cause an unrelated gene to be activated. This can only happen if these sites are located in open chromatin, which is correlated with unmethylated markers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Differential methylation means that some genes are only methylated in either the Maternal or Paternal allele. This is called genetic imprinting and can be disrupted causing cancer and other diseases. In the maternal allele of a healthy cell, the ICR correlated with the H19 gene is unmethylated. This causes the enhancers downstream to transcribe the H19 gene. In the paternal allele of a healthy cell, the ICR is methylated, which makes the H19 promoter also methylated. In this allele, the enhancers act on the lgf2 gene upstream of the ICR expressing it instead of the H19 Gene. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a cell with Wilm's Tumor, both alleles have methylated ICRs and methylated promoters on H19. This leads to the enhancers to act on both maternal and paternal Ifg2 genes without expressing H19 at all. Since Ifg2 is a gene associated with a protein growth factor, increased expression of it can lead to abberant replication of the cell since IGF2 is known to be mitogenic. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Demethylating agent, which means that it acts on the DNA to lower the amount of methylation. It inhibits DNA Methyltransferases, which means that the daughter cells do not fully inherit the epigenetic marks of the parent cell. This is because DMTA1 is repsobsible for the methylation of hemi-methylated regions inherited from the parent cell. </p>
<p>Since Decitabine decreases the DNA methylation marks, it can reactivate tumor suppressing genes that have been turned off by CpG hypermethylation in their promoters. Since unusual CpG hypermethylation is easier to detect than hyponethylation, cells can be screened for potential cancerous epigenomes and Decitabine can be applied. </p>
<p>It is important to note that since Decitabine inhibits DMTAs, it acts globally across the genome and may demethylate genes that are methylated in a wild-type cell, which may lead to some genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is a heritable mark, it is expected that cells that have certain markers methylated will have daughter cells where the same markers methylated, as long as DNA Methyltransferases are functioning properly. Likewise, if a cell doesn't have methylated sites, then unless the appropriate lncRNA or proteins are envoked, the site will continue to be demethylated. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is where methylation marks are removed in order to do repair of the genes or for epigenetic reprogramming. This happens most prominently in early embrionic and Progenitor Germ Cell development in the womb. The demethylation doesn't happen to repetitive elemnts and only happens in PGC development for imprinted genes.</p>
<p>Any disruption to the active or passive demethylation processes or the re-methylation processes is dangerous since in different sensitive periods there are different portions of the genome methylated/demethylated. Any disruption of those processes can lead to unmethylated repeats or disruption of the imprintin process. Having demethylated repeats is one of the symptoms of a cancer cell. </p></div>
