    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of cytosine nucleotides in CpG dinucleotides results in a stable repressive epigenetic mark that is heritable through DNA replication and cell division. In normal somatic cells the majority of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome are methylated. These marks repress transposable elements such as long terminal repeats (LTRs) and long interspersed elements and short interspersed elements (LINEs and SINEs). Expression of these elements prevents their transposition, increasing the overall stability of the genome. Methylation in intragenic regions is thought to repress cryptic splice sites and cryptic translational start sites within introns, reducing background expression of alternatively spliced proteins. Non-coding RNAs are also found within introns of active genes and are also repressed by intragenic methylation. CpG dinucleotide rich regions are found at gene promoters and these "CpG islands" tend to be resistant to methylation. When these sites are methylated the methyl groups prevent transcription e.g. by providing binding sites for MeCP2 proteins which recruit chromatin modifying enzymes to the region.</p>
<p>In cancer there is a tendency towards the progressive reduction of gene body and intergenic methylation, leading to increased genomic instability and aberrant expression of oncogenes and non-coding RNAs that affect gene expression levels. At the same time, there tends to be an increase in methylation at CpG islands in gene promoters. This can cause suppression of tumour suppressor genes, which leads to abnormal cell growth, division and motility, resulting in tumour development. Accumulation of these marks can also lead to tumour progression and metastasis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19-Igf2 imprinted gene cluster is found at an imprinting control region (ICR) on chromosome 11.<em> Igf2</em> is found upstream of the ICR and is normally only expressed on the paternal allele. <em>H19</em> is found downstream of the ICR and is normally only expressed on the maternal allele. Both genes share the same enhancer elements. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and is bound by the CTCF insulator, which prevents the <em>Igf2</em> gene from accessing the enhancers. Histone methylation at H3K4 on the maternal <em>H19</em> ICR protects this region from DNA methylation, keeping the <em>H19</em> gene active. On the paternal allele, methylation at the ICR prevents binding of CTCF, which allows methylation at the <em>H19</em> gene and activation of <em>Igf2</em>. This leads to reciprocal uniparental expression of each gene.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, paediatric tumours affecting the kidneys, there is a specific loss of imprinting of the <em>Igf2</em> gene on the maternal allele, due to aberrant hypermethylation of the maternal H19-Igfr2 ICR, which allows <em>Igfr2</em> preferential access to the shared enhancers which reactivates the gene, leading to biallelic expression. <em>Igf2</em> is involved in growth control and its overexpression causes overgrowth of cells, leading to Wilms tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analogue, which can become incorporated into DNA, where it covalently binds DNA methyltransferases, thus causing irreversible inactivation. This results in DNA de-methylation. At high doses, Decitabine is cytotoxic, causing cell death, while at lower doses cells will tolerate the drug and survive with reduced levels of methylation. This feature of Decitabine has been used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a group of haematologic disorders, which are the precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia. Neoplastic cells tend to become hypermethylated, which can cause suppression of tumour suppressor genes, which in turn leads to abnormal cell growth and division. Treatment with Decitabine reverses this increase in DNA methyltransferase activity, leading to reactivation of tumour suppressors and restoring normal cell growth and division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark that can survive DNA replication and cell division, as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) recognises these marks and adds matching groups to newly synthesised DNA. Methylation in germ cells can be transmitted to subsequent generations. Major methylation reprogramming occurs during two main sensitive periods of development, where large-scale de-methylation and subsequent re-methylation occur. This happens during the pre-implantation period of gestation and during the formation of the primordial germ cells.</p>
<p>Exposure to drugs that affect methylation during these sensitive periods e.g. newly pregnant women, or prebubescent girls whose oocytes are still in a hemizygous and unmethylated state, may pass on inappropriately methylated genes to their offspring, leading to lasting effects in future generations. In rat models of drug effects, approximately 90% of male offspring from mothers who were exposed to the anti-androgenic fungicide, vinclozolin, were sub-fertile. This phenotype was carried through to the second and third generations of offspring, demonstrating a transgenerational effect, which may occur due to incomplete epigenetic reprogramming. It is therefore inadvisable to give DNA methylating drugs to patients during sensitive periods of development in case abnormal methylation marks are transmitted to their offspring.</p></div>
