    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands in inactive genes are usually methylated to suppress their expression. By contrast, CpG islands located around the promoters are usually demethylated. In cancer cells there is hypermethylation of this promoters, which silences the subjacent genes.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes result in the inactivation of these genes. Gene inactivation can result in inefective DNA repair, decrease in apoptosis, alterations in cell adherence, among others, causing cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is found in CpG sequences troughout the entire genome including at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats. This helps mantaining the genome integrity. In cancer cells, hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements result in genomic instability. Chromosomal abnormalities such as deletions, insertions or translocations can occur, causing cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to many diseases. Inheritance of two copies of one of mother's genes and none of the father's (or vice-versa) can result in serious syndromes or many types of cancer. In the the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele has an unmethylated promoter and therefore is active. The maternal allele is methylated and therefore inactive. In healthy individuals, transcription of only the paternal gene occurs to produce Igf2 mRNA.</p>
<p>In patients with Wilm's tumour, both copies (maternal and paternal) of Igf2 gene are expressed, showing loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene. Increased activity of the Igf2 gene has been associated with many types of cancer.</p>
<p>An increase of insulin-like growth factor 2 can stimulate the growth of tumor cells. Otherwise, loss of Igf2 gene activity can lead to poor growth and short stature.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a prodrug and it needs to be activated by phosphorilation. The drug is transported into the cell by a transport system, and then it is activated. The drug is then incorporated into DNA, where it binds to the methyltransferase enzyme, inactivating it. The inhibition of the enzime results in hypomethylation of the DNA. The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is due to the fact that it allows gene activation and induction of apoptosis, cell repair, cellular differentiation, which were previously blocked by the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming. At this point, the epigenetic marks are removed, which makes the cell vulnerable and therefore not a good target for drugs. These periods of epigenetic reprogramming occur in early development and in primordial germ cell development. </p>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment simply because epigenetic changes are passed on through the generations of cells. Therefore, erased methylations can be perpetrated allowing the activation of genes that would otherwise be inactivated. </p></div>
