    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group that generally (in mammals) occurs at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides, converting cytosine into 5-methylcytosine. The enzyme responsible for that is DNA methyltransferase. DNA methylation is one kind of epigenetic modification, a type of modification that can alter gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. CpG dinucleotides can be found at high frequency in some genomic regions: these regions are called CpG islands and are found in 60% of the promoters. Approximately 70-80% of mammalian somatic cells are methylated at the level of CpG dinucleotides (mostly intergenic and repetitive regions), conversely, most of the CpG islands are usually unmethylated. </p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, a phenomenon called CpG island hypermethylation (or CGI hypermethylation). This process can silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes, thus contributing to cancer. According to the Knudson hypothesis, multiple factors must occur in order to develop cancer, so just the hypermethylation of a tumor suppressor gene is not sufficient for developing cancer. In any case, it is widely accepted that DNA methylation leading to tumor suppressor gene silencing is one of the factors that contribute to cancer. Interestingly, the pattern of CpG islands hypermethylation differs among different types of cancers.</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to cancer is the hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive regions. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repeated elements are methylated. The reason for that is providing genome stability. Accordingly, cells lacking DNA methyltransferase show genome instability (e.g. deletions, insertions, duplications, translocations...). The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeated elements is another characteristic of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Therefore, DNA methylation can contribute to cancer by silencing tumor suppressors (through CpG island hypermethylation) and by causing genome instability (through hypomethylation of repeated elements and intergenomic regions). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The discovery that epigenetic modifications control gene expression and that epigenetic marks show big differences between healthy and cancer cells opened the way to the study of new therapies. Since epigenetic modifications are reversible and, differently from genetic modifications, susceptible to chemical intervention, a drug-based therapy may be effective. At the present time two epigenetic drugs are on the market, <span>azacitidine and <span>decitabine, and</span></span> both of them are<span> DNA-demethylating agents. These drugs are citosine nucleoside analogs that are incorporated into the DNA during replication. When the DNA methyltransferase bind the citosine analogs, a covalent bound is formed, so the methyltransferase can no longer be released and this leads to hypomethylation. Since the effect of these drugs is replication-dependent, it affects the cells with high replication rate, and cancer cells replicate more than other cells. At low dosages, these drugs provide a very good anti-neoplastic effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, the epigenetic status of a cell can be passed through generations (of cells) until it is ereased. For this reason, epigenetic modifications caused by drugs can have enduring effects. There are two sensitive periods in which it would be necessary to avoid epigenetic treatments. Such periods have been identified in early (preimplantation) development and during primordial germ cells development, and are characterized by active remodelling of the epigenome thus being highly sensitive to changes in the environment. Modifying the epigenetic environment during the sensitive periods (e.g. inhibiting methylation with d<span>ecitabine</span>) would likely have deleterious effects, due to the disruption of the normal epigenetic programming of the cells which can lead to genomic instability and modifications of gene expression. For these reasons the usage of epigenetic drugs must take sensitive periods into careful consideration, and the treatments should avoid such periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed by 4 elements: the Igf2 gene which produces the Insulin-like growth factor 2 protein, an Imprinting Control Region (ICR), a gene that produces a lncRNA (H19) and enhancer sequences. The paternal allele is imprinted, so the ICR and H19 promoters are methylated. As result the ICR is unavaible for binding, H19 is silenced, and the enhancers are able to access Igf2 (by forming a loop) so the protein is expressed from the paternal allele. The maternal allele is not imprinted, so H19 lncRNA (which is a reservoir of miRNAs) is transcribed and the CTCF protein can bind to the ICR. CTCF is an insulator protein which prevent the action of the enhancers on Igf2, so the maternal Igf2 is silenced. Instead, maternal enhancers bind to H19. Wilm's tumor is characterized by the loss of imprinting by hypermethylation of ICRs at the H19/Igf2 cluster: ICRs are methylated in both the alleles, CTCF cannot bind and insulate Igf2 from the enhancers so the expression of Igf2 changes from paternal to biparental. This leads to an overexpression of Igf2 and since it is a growth factor, the double dose promotes cellular growth. </p></div>
