    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal conditions, the CpG islands are demethylated while the introns, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are methylated. This gives stability to the genome, impends the displacement of transposons inside the genome.. In cancer the CpG islands become methylated while the introns, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements become demethylated. Then the genome becomes instable, there is illegitimate recombination between repeats,activation of repeats and transposition,activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of other genes;also there are deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. There is also a loss of Imprinting in the ICRs . Methylation of the CpG islands and shores of the tumor suppressive genes is an important aberration of the epigenetic control in Cancer; this can be considered as an alternative to genetic mutation to silence the tumor suppressor gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hyopermethylation or hypomethylation) causes a loss of expression of growth restrictive genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. This is a common sign in the beginning stages of cancer formation. In a normal cell, hypermethylation of ICR can be  present in the paternal allele only while in Wilm's tumor it is seen in both the maternal and paternal alleles and then the Igf2 overexpresses itself.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs which affect the DNMTi. It is a nucleoside analog which binds in an irreversible way to DNMT and it is claimed that it becomes incorporated into the DNA. It has an antineoplastic effect but lacks of specificity. It is recommended in the treatment of hematological malignant tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a period when the development of the fertilized egg  (the pre-implantation period) is taking place.The sensitive period of development is the period of gametogenesis. Treating a patient during the sensitive period of development would be inadvisable as they could probably affect the developing embryo at the preimplantation or at the gametogenic periods. Dna methylation is mitotically heritable; that would be the most endurable effect.p</p></div>
