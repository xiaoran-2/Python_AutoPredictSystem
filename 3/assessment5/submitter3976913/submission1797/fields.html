    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Within normal cells DNA methylation, which is the addition of a methyl group onto a cytosine, occurs at CpG islands, or more likely CpG shores, as a means of silencing said gene. Now in cancer cells CpG island hypermethylation generally occurs at tumor suppressor genes thus resulting in the cell being able to grow un-controllably. This DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis (cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA). An example of this would be MLH1 in colorectal cancer (Lynch Syndrome) which may be a cause from constitutional epimutation’s. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Now in normal cells DNA methylation may also occur within the intergenic regions along with repetitive elements. It occurs within the intergenic regions as a means of controlling genomic instability by ensuring no chromosomes are lost or replaced e.g. Reciprocal translocation. In terms of repeats in normal cells they would normally be heavily methylated, as to ensure there isn’t an over load of that specific gene, and would also be heterochromatized.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In cancer cells however there is genome wide hypomethylation within the intergenic region and repetitive elements. It means they are able to be expressed freely. Also they are now euchromatin meaning they may be replicated easily and are able to move around the nucleus, this may lead to transcriptional aberration. In conclusion this hypomethylation can lead to upstream promotors being switched on, deletion of genes, insertion of genes and reciprocal translocation of certain locus's of genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated for CTCF meaning it is unable to bind meaning there is no insulator action so Igf2 is free to be expressed. So when this ICR is unmethylated, as it is in the maternal allele, it is bound by a protein named CTCF which is an insulator protein meaning is able to insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Now because this insulates Igf2 it means these enhancers are free to enhance the expression of the lnc RNA H19. This is thought to occur due to chromatin looping meaning that the proffered loop is between the enhancers and Igf 2 however as CTCF blocks this the enhancers go for second best meaning the H19 RNA.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In a cancer cell, like Wilm’s tumour, imprinting goes awry and there is hypermethylation of the ICR, meaning CTCF may not bind, on the paternal, but also the maternal! This which results in over expression of Igf2 as this allows for the enhancers to come into contact with the Igf2 gene locus rather than the H19 gene locus. Since Igf2 is a growth enhancer it means the tumour cell is able to grow to a dangerous size.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The drug Decitabine is a form of DNA methylation inhibitor, ipso facto. DNA methylation occurs thanks to De Novo Methyl Transferase and is maintained by DNMT1. The way in which Decitabine operates is that when it is incorporated within the DNA this nucleoside analogue irreversibly binds to the DNMT1 thus blocking its functioning meaning this DNA methylation is not passed onto the daughter cells and seeing as cancer cells proliferate at a substantial rate this can only be a good thing.   This effect however only occurs at much lower doses than what was historically thought as at a high rate it may be toxic and it is only at a much lower dose that it has this anti neoplastic effect.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Decitabine is used for Myelodysplastic syndrome sufferers, this condition has high levels of CpG hypermethylation. Other negatives are that it is non-specific and the mechanism of action is unclear.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation effectively controls the cells function. Now while this function may go awry at times, if this function is silenced forever lasting then this could have catastrophic consequences. For example the complete and permanent removal of DNMT1 would halt the passing of DNA methylation from mother to daughter cell thus completely alter the cells function. This could especially be case if occurs during a sensitive period. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The most commonly accepted genetic sensitive period is during the embryos pre implantation phase and within primordial germ cells. During this time there is a complete removal thus resetting of both maternal and paternal DNA methylation. The paternal removal is active, as it is done by enzymatic action, while the maternal is passive, due to a lack of DNMT! Meaning the DNA methylation is simply phased and diluted out. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Treating patients during this time with epigenetic altering drugs would inadvisable as it is during this time, as mentioned in the first sentence, that effectively the cells function is being laid down. This is the making of the cell and even though mistakes may be naturally made, synthetically making other would be to large of a possibility.</span></p></div>
