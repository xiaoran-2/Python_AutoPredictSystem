    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are located at the promoters of genes.In a normal cell they are hypomethylated .Methylation at CpG islands causes condensation of chromatin resulting in scilencing gene expression.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer cells the CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes are increasingly methylated.</span></p>
<p>By hypermethylation cancer cells epigenetically silence the tumor suppresser genes. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable it forms a good way of locking the epigenetic scilencing in the cell. This methylation mediated silencing can represent one of hits in Knudson’s hypothesis. These epimutations are also rapidly selected for and over time the mutated cells divide rapidly forming a cancerous growth.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a normal cell.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity. Methylation also silences expression of cryptic promoters or a cryptic splice site preventing transcriptional interference which can occur if the promoter of a gene and the cryptic promoter are activated simultaneously.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity by silencing of repeats. this prevents genomic disruption by protecting genome from transposable elements jumping around.it also prevents Transcriptional disruption by strong or cryptic promoters.                                                                                                    DNA methylation in intergenic regions prevents illegitimate recombination by keeping chromatin in compact form.</p>
<p>In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated and  hypomethylation occurs mostly at repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Cancer cells with unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements exhibit genomic instability .the hypomethylation makes chromatin less compact and misalignment and subsequent illegitimate recombination  of repeats results. Hypomethylation activates the repeats and they transpose around the genome.this can disrupt or activate neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation can also result in activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Overall this leads to additional  illegitimate deletions, insertions, duplications and reciprocal translocations  resulting in abnormal karyotype and chromosomal instability</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region on the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele meaning it is paternally imprinted.The ICR methylation means CTCF can not bind to and insulate Igf2 . The enhancers are therefore free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression from the paternal allele .The methylation at ICR spreads to the H19 CpG island promoter  causing its methylation and subsequent inactivation.</p>
<p>The imprint control region on the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele.When the ICR is unmethylated it is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF.This protein insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers which would otherwise preferencially cause Igf2 expression .This renders the downstream enhansers free to act on H19  instead of Igf2 and enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>Deletion of the maternal ICR or its hypermethylation results in activation of the normally silent maternal <em>Igf2</em> allele and down-regulation of <em>H19</em> .<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Paternal uniparental disomy at 11p15.5 loci also causes over expression of Igf2 and under expression of H19.</span></p>
<p>Down regulation of H19 which acts as a tumor suppressor and the upregulation of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gene leads to overgrowth and tumor development seen in wilms tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alteration is an epigenetic change and epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.This could lead to enduring effects on the epigenome .</p>
<p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming in cell are those during which if u alter the environment of the cells, or if u speed the reprogramming process up or  avoid them entirely there are adverse effects on the development of the organism due to poor efficiency of the reprogramming process</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">There are two sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming i.e early embryonic development( the preimplantation period) and primordial germ cell development. Treating patients ,with drugs that alter  DNA methylation, during these periods such as during early or midgestation pregnancy will interfere with the normal epigenetic reprogramming processes and should be avoided</span></p>
<p>The reprogramming during the sensitive periods ensures totipotency of the next generation cells .also genomic imprinting relies on proper reprogramming of epigenetic marks during the sensitive periods.any alteration in DNA methylation by these drugs during this period will result in poor embryonic development and poor survival .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It inhibit DNA methylation and functions by reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes .</span></p>
<p>Decitabine reverts hypermethylation induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes .This hypermethylation plays a fundamental role in human tumorigenesis.The reversion of these epigenetic mutations  restores proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Metabolites of decitabine  become substrates for the DNA </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">replication machinery and become incorporated into DNA. They are then recognized by the DNA methyltransferases as a natural </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">substrate and the enzymes initiates the methylation reaction.A</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> covalent </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">bond is then formed between the incorporated metabolite of decitabine and the </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">enzyme. This bond cannot be resolved as it normally would have been</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> Thus </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">the enzyme remains covalently bound to DNA and its DNA methyltransferase f</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">unction is blocked. In addition, the covalent protein </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">adduction also compromises the functionality of DNA and triggers </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA damage signaling, resulting in the degradation of trapped </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methyltransferases As a consequence, methylation </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">marks become lost during DNA replication.</span></p></div>
