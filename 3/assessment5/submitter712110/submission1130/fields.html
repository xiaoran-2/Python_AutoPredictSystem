    <h1>Submission 1130 from Anon (session_user_id: d0591d63a602bed7b923bfa7f98c374f5b940738)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Azacytidine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, thereby inhibiting the addition of Methyl groups to DNA.  The other drug used in Baylin's protocol was a histone deacetylase inhibitor.  After the combination treatment, the patients's tumors were more responsive to traditional drugs.  Epigenomic changes which may have sensitized the tumors could have been demethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores, and therefore activation of tumor suppressor genes, inactivation of oncogenes, or both.  Imprint Control Regions could also have been demethylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so a drug such as azacytidine can influence daughter cells of the cancer being treated - which is how the Baylin protocol appeared to sensitize the tumor cells.</p>
<p>A 'sensitive' period is defined as a time frame during which essential epigenetic marks are set down that regulate the viability of the developing conceptus (early embryonic development) and the Primordial Germ Cells as they are being generated.  Use of a drug that disrupts methylation across the genome during such a sensitive period could have devastating consequences - and should be avoided if at all possible.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As a cell progresses through the increasingly dysfunctional stages of hyperplasia - dysplasia - neoplasia - metastasis, it exhibits increased HYPO-methylation genome-wide but a locus-specific HYPER-methylation pattern.  This HYPER-methylation is especially prevalent at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes, as well as at ICR's (Imprint Control Regions).  In Normal cells, the CpG islands are generally unmethylated, and much more likely to be methylated in a Cancer cell.  This tends to silence tumor suppressor genes, thus allowing the cancer cells to proliferate.</p>
<p>Decitabine is in the class of DNA-demethylating agents, which inhibit DNA methyltransferases.  The use of Decitabine can strip the Methyl groups from the CpG islands, thereby allowing the tumor suppressor (or similarly beneficial) genes to be actively read again - including in daughter cells - and limiting or stopping further cancer cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting should result in gene expression in a mono-allelic parent-of-origin pattern, i.e., one allele from either the maternal or paternal parent should be the only one expressed.  An example of this mono-allelic process can be seen in the expression of the growth factor Igf2 (Insulin -like growth factor 2).  It is designed to be silent in the maternal allele and expressed via the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Methylation or hypomethylation control this process.  On the maternal allele, the ICR which is sited adjacent to the H19 gene is unmethylated and also has CTCF (a transcriptional repressor) attached to it.  This pattern allows the enhancers adjacent to the H19 gene to activate H19 rather than influence Igf2.  This, the maternal allele for Igf2 is silenced in the normal cell.</p>
<p>The paternal allele is intended to be the active allele expressing Igf2.  Its ICR and CpG islands near H19 are both highly methylated, so that the enhancers promote the expression of Igf2 while H19 is silenced. In a normal cell, the Igf2 is maternally DNA silenced and paternally DNA expressed.</p>
<p>There is loss of imprint control in Wilm's tumor.  Both maternal &amp; paternal ICR's are hypermethylated, so that imprint contol is lost &amp; Igf2 is expressed in a double dose in this tumor type.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although CpG sites are typically methylated, this is NOT the case for CpG islands.  The transcription start sites for ~ half of all human genes are flanked by CpG islands that are typically UN-methylated.  These genes would thus permit open paths to gene expression in normal cells. (Source: Epigenie.com: "Cancer Epigenetics"). CpG island shores would exhibit the same patterns.  These islands and island shores are found in the PROMOTERS of Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs), so that when the islands are unmethylated, the TSGs are active and effective in maintaining a normal cell.</p>
<p>Most cancers exhibit focal HYPER-methylation, especially in PROMOTER-associated CpG islands of TSGs.  That permanently silences the genes, allowing the cells to proliferate.  Even worse, the hypermethylation is mitotically inherited by daughter cells - and the cancer can run wild.  Examples of CpG island hypermethylation involving a single gene include retinoblastoma, breast cancer (BrCa) and colon cancer (MLH1) </p>
<p>The Knudson Hypothesis of multiple hits, as it relates to DNA methylation and disease, could involve loss of TSG function AND activation of an oncogene.  Methylation accumulates with aging, so that all 3 processes could lead to cancer and/or other diseases when segments of DNA are silenced due to hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at INTERGENIC REGIONS is to maintain genomic integrity, i.e., to prevent abnormal karyotypes.  According to Prof. Timothy Bestor's "Genomic Defense Model", this is to protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at REPETITIVE ELEMENTS also maintains genomoc stability, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, interference from strong promoters, and to prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>The methylation patterns are crossed in cancer, with CpG islands methylated and the intergenic &amp; repetitive elements HYPO-methylated.  That allows activation of the repetitive elements, which may be retroviruses or transposons that may lead to piRNA expression.</p>
<p>How DNA methylation effects a cancer depends on the tumor type &amp; stage of disease.  But it is not good in any case.</p></div>
