    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is related wiht gene activation. In cancer CpG islands are methylated and in result some genes are silenced. Some of these methylated CpG islands are in promotors of tumor supressor genes, and their inactivation contributes to the development of cancer. Also alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs, can result in loss of imprinting and loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergfenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells protects the genome to inestability,by means of silencing transpostion elements, cryptic promoters and avoiding illegitimate recombination between repeats. In cancer cells, the hypomethylation of these regions generates genomic inestability via all the proceses explained before. Illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of transpons, activation of cryptoc promoters and disruption to neighbounding genes; increase the genomic inestability and that produces the loss of supressors genes activity and the activation of oncogenes, genes that give to the cells and advantatge to survive and divde.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes can have enduring effects because those changes are passed on during cell divisions until the epigenetic state is actively erased. Once its erased it is not returned to the original state. So the effect of the drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects last beyond the period of the treatment.</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods are those in which DNA methylation is erased and reprogramed. Those periods ocurrs during the early develompment, from conception (egg fertilitzation) to blastocyst; and during the primordial germ cell development.</span></p>
<p><span>In case of pregnant women patients the use of drugs that alter DNA methylation would be take with caution, because in those cases the fetus is passing throughout sensitive periods and drugs that alther DNA methylation could affect the correct reprograming in the fetus' cells and fetus' primordial germ cells. For instance, using an hypomethylating agent in a pregnant women during those sensitive periods could produce hypomethylated genome in the fetus' cells if it is treating before balstocyst or hypomethylated genome in primordial germ cells if its treating after blastocyst and during the primordial germ cell development. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Ifg2 cluster there is an imprinting control region. In the paternal allele it's methylated, when it's methylated CTCF4 can't bind its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers will act on Igf2 activating that gene. In the maternal allele, the imprinting control region is unmethylated; that means that CTCF4 can bind its insulator element to the control region, and the enhancers in this case will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting, and what happened is that there is an incread methylation of the imprinting control region on the maternal allele, as a result you have an expression of Igf2 also in the maternal allele, so you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting so having a doble dose can desregulate the cell live circle and promote a particular childhood kindey tumor, Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a cytadine analog, is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that acts as an hypomethylating agent. Inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase we can reduce the DNA methylation that in some cancers is exacerbated.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodysplasic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia. As a ctyadine analog, Decitabine has a dual action: Decitabine affects cell differentiation by demethylation leading to reactivation of genes (mainly tumour supressors) that have previously been rendered inactive (due to hypermethylation); and also direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA, causing cell death.</p></div>
