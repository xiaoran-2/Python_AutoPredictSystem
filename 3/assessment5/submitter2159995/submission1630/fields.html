    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypomethylated and the rest of the genome hypermethylated. The hypomethylation of CpG islands allows normal genes expression, especially the expression of tumour suppressor genes. In cancer, these genes are silenced by the abnormal hypermethylation of CpG islands, the normally expressed tumour suppressor genes are silenced. Cell growth becomes uncontrollable, which contributes to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated to silence them. In cancer, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements can become hypomethylated and are expressed instead of being silenced. Hypomethylation generally leads to genomic instability by activating repeats, allowing illegitimate recombinations between repeats (since the chromatin is not densely packed anymore), activating cryptic promoters and disrupting neighbouring genes. All of these can lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Another mechanism is the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, which allows the expression of oncogenes which should normally be silenced. The oncogenes increase cell growth, which contributes to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the 'normal' H19/lgf2 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the enhancers act on Igf2 and allow it to be expressed. On the maternal allele, the enhancers act on H19 because an insulator elements was bound to the hypomethylated control region. Therefore the enhancers do not act on Igf2 expression and Igf2 remains silent on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>This means the paternal allele is the only one that expresses Igf2 and the maternal allele is imprinted and inactivated. In Wilm's tumour, the loss of imprinting of the imprint control region makes the normally repressed maternal allele active by hyper methylating the imprint control region. This means igf2 is expressed on both parental alleles and this double dose of igf2 expression leads to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p align="center">Decitabine is a DNA demythelating agent (also called hypomethylating agent) which acts by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase enzyme. It is a nucleoside analog that binds to the DNA during replicating and prevents the DNA methyltransferase from binding to the DNA and therefore prevents it from laying down methylation. By preventing the action of this enzyme, it can remove epigenetic marks such as abnormal methylation of CpG islands and over-methylation of histone proteins.</p>
<p align="center">Once Decitabine removes this abnormal methylation, the genes that were silenced by the over-methylation can now be expressed. Once the tumor-suppressor genes are expressed, the uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells will stop.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p align="center">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last longer that the treatment period because the modified epigenetic marks will be passed on to daughter cells intact, and granddaughter cells and so on. Therefore the epigenetic marks can be passed on forever until they are actively erased.  If these drugs are used during a sensitive period, then the body’s normal removing and relaying of epigenetic marks might be disrupted. In this context sensitive periods include embryonic development, child development and gametes production.</p>
<p align="center">Therefore these drugs should not be used in children, pregnant women and adults of childbearing age. The consequences for the patient and their potential children and grandchildren could be dangerous. It is safe to use them outside sensitive periods, for example in elderly patients.</p>
