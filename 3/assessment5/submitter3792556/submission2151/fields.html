    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands, which are usually found in the promoters of genes, leads to silencing of these genes. In normal cells, most CpG islands are <strong>hypomethylated</strong>, unless the gene in question needs to be silenced for the proper functioning of the cell. In cancer cells, CpG islands in promoters of some genes (mainly tumour suppressor genes) are <strong>hypermethylated</strong>. This causes silencing or under-expression of these genes, which allows the cells to multiply in an uncontrolled manner and create a tumour. Different combinations of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated in different types of tumours.</p>
<p>Other than CpG islands, DNA methylation is found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In a normal cell, these parts of the genome are heavily methylated and hence not transcribed. Intergenic regions are silenced because they are not part of genes. Repetitive elements can copy and paste themselves at random places in the genome, which may cause illegitimate crossing over between chromosomes and disruption of genes. Thus they are silenced by DNA methylation to maintain <strong>genomic stability</strong>. In cancer cells, there is genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This is found in all types of tumours. It causes all kinds of mutations in the genome, including over-expression of oncogenes (growth promoting genes) and deregulation of tissue specific genes. </p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation can be rapidly selected for. Ultimately, the cells which accumulate epimutations that allow uncontrolled growth and metastasis survive and create the tumour.</p>
<pre class="hg-tinymce-code">In cancer cells, the <strong>DNA methylation pattern of normal cells is</strong> <strong>reversed</strong> - normally hypomethylated CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells and normally hypermethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells.</pre>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are normally expressed from <strong>only one chromosome </strong>(either the maternally inherited chromosome or the paternally inherited chromosome). Disruption of imprinting is often found in cancer, as many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation and/or promotion.</p>
<h2>H19/Igf2 cluster and Wilm's tumour</h2>
<p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is heavily methylated. This prevents CTCF, a chromatin binding protein, from binding to the ICR. The enhancers found downstream of the ICR can hence access the Igf2 locus and activate its expression. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated. CTCF binds to the ICR and blocks the enhancers to prevent them from activating the Igf2 gene.</p>
<pre class="hg-tinymce-code">Hence in a normal cell, Igf2 is expressed <strong>only from the paternal allele</strong>. </pre>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 locus is <strong>methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles.</strong> Thus instead of being paternally imprinted, Igf2 shows <strong>biallelic expression</strong> in Wilm's tumour cells. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, overexpression of Igf2 can cause excessive growth and cell division, leading to the formation of a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>. This means that when a cell divides, the daughter cells produced are methylated in exactly the same parts of the genome as the original cell was. Hence when a drug makes an alteration to the DNA methylation pattern of a cell,<strong> the alteration is passed on intact</strong> to all the cells it produces. </p>
<p>Drugs which alter DNA methylation patterns should be avoided during certain periods called sensitive periods. A sensitive period refers to a time interval when active reprogramming of the epigenome is occuring - either erasure or setting down of new epigenetic marks, including DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The two main sensitive periods of development are</p>
<ul><li>Early development (from the fertilised egg to the epiblast stage) and</li>
<li>Primordial germ cell development (occurs upto about the onset puberty in humans)</li>
</ul><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> Making changes to the DNA methylation patterns during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it may result in genome-wide disruption of DNA methylation patterns. For example, inhibiting the action of a de-novo DNA methyltransferase may be useful to prevent hypermethylation of tumour-suppressor genes, but during a period in which DNA methylation is being actively laid down, this could cause unwanted damage. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is an analogue of cytosine. Incorporation of Decitabine into DNA prevents DNA methyltransferase from binding to the DNA, thus preventing the DNA from being methylated. Hence, decitabine is a <strong>DNA methylation inhibitor</strong>. </p>
<p>Decitabine promotes hypomethylation of the genome, by blocking the action of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which add methyl groups to the cytosines in DNA. Wherever decitabine is found in place of cytosine, this methylation cannot occur. Hence the DNA methylation level keeps falling as more and more cell divisions occur. </p>
<p>Tumour cells have high levels of methylation (or hypermethylation) in CpG island promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Hence for a cancer that manifests itself as a bunch of cells that can avoid the effect of tumour suppressor genes, inhibition of DNA methylation is an effective way of <strong>preventing the tumour from spreading</strong>. </p></div>
