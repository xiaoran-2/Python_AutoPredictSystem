    <div class="field-value"><p>To understand how DNA Methylation  is altered in Cancer it will help to compare it to normal function in the absence of cancer. If we look at DNA Methylation at the CPG islands, these are normally kept clear of Methylation., this is thought to play a role in maintenance of epigenetic heritability and maintains clear passages for normal gene expression. Cancer cells in CPG islands  conversely trend to hypermethylation, having the effect of permanently silencing the underlying gene governed by a specific promoter. CPG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was first described in colorectal cancer but has been seen in many other neoplastic conditions. Good evidence has been found in specific studies to show that <span> <span>RB150, p16 (CDKN2A)51, VHL52, and MLH153 genes. Each of these genes can be inactivated by either DNA methylation or a mutation with equal consequences for cancer development, that is inactivating tumour suppressor genes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In contrast The Normal function of repeats is to promote genomic stability, that is we don't want to gain, lose or alter chromosomes. the normal state of these regions is Hypermethylation giving heterochromatin (closed) and limiting access to the genetic machinery. In cancer you have the reverse, hypomethylation  and chromatin, this enables exposure to  alignment of repeats which could result in illegitimate recombinations, for instance reciprical translocations between different chromosomes.   Evidence for this is in mice where experiments were done to create mice with low/no DNA methyltransferase 1 in  particular tissues, these specific tissues  then went on to develop cancers.                                    </span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/igf2 cluster  the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br />When it's unmethylated CTCF acts as aninsulator element, and it means that the enhancers will work on H19. Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there will be no expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers will work on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. <br />With loss of imprinting you have hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. So now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2, 2 hits of Igf2 in comparison to what will be seen in a normal cell.  Loss of imprinting seems to have particular effects on genes that effect growth, either growth promoting or growth suppression factors. In this instance it is the high expression of growth factor that is<br />linked to Wilm's tumour. <br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine and Azacytidine are both classed as <span>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. According to the manufacturers website (http://www.dacogen.com/HowDACOGENisDesignedtoWork.aspx) "<span>Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis." Stressman and Lyko                                  (<span>Int. J.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects because certain processes can be switched on or off, permanently at certain phases of cell development. There is also some who believe that these effects could be passed on from generation to generation. These drugs could be effective at certain times when chromatin is open, laying down changes that allow standard chemo to work more effectively in certain patients who currently don't respond very well.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those in early oocyte production and pre implantation and in growth phases. (childhood, pre-adolescence, puberty). These are periods that you would need to avoid drug treatment. Treatment at such time could have major effects on developing eggs, embryo's and the developing child.</p></div>
