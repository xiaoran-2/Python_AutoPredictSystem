In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A CpG island is a region of the DNA that contain many cythosine and guanine nucleotids, thoose ones can be methilated or not. In a normal cell the action of a methiltransferase give a methil group to thoose nucleotides that normally are located in the promoters of the gene. This methilation inhibits the transciption of the gene, it is silenced, if the CpG island is not methilated is active. In cancer there is a hypermethilation of theese regions. Let's imagine that we have a tumor supressor gene with hypermethilated CpG islands, this can cotributes to develop a disease. Talking about repetitive elements thoose ones are methylated, so they are inactive, if there is an epigenetic abnormality thoose repetitive element can be activated (aberrant transposition) and carry different mystakes in recombination such as delections, reciprocal trasposition or insertions that can carry to many diferent deseases. If we have for example a defectuous DNMT1 it can course thoose genomic abnormalities that i have spoke about.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell in the Igf2/h19 cluster we have that the paternal allele is methilated, so we have the expression of the Igf2, but not the H19 expression. If we see the maternal allele the intergenomic region is not methilated, so the enhancers act to the H19 so this gene is prossesed meanwhile Igf2 is inactive. If we have an epigenetic aberration it is possible that the intergenic region of the maternal allele get methilated, so we will have the same pattern of expression like the paternal allele, it means that we will have a doble dosis of Igf2 and none of H19 causing the Wilm's tumour in the kidney.<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-cf02e6a1e0d9076e1defc865/970238/asst-5/970238-52123a9c885008.49485549.png" alt="" /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is an DNMT inhibitor, this group of drugs are nucleoside analogs, and have an irreversible bind to the DNMT after they are incorporated to the DNA, it means that need the divsion of the cell to make they work. The problem of this farmac is thar it is not specific, and the mecanism of action it is not clear yet. It can be used to trat hematological malignancies and it is in trials for solid tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methilation is a process needed for the correct working of the DNA, many enzimes recognize thoose epigenetic marks, if we have a disrupted one, the enzime machinery will have some mistakes and genes that are normally silenced became active. Also we have spoke about recombinations consecuences and we have to remember that epigenetc marks are mitotically heritable. There are many periods called sensitive periods when the epigenetics marks have to be removed or placed (primordial germ cell development and early development, where we have the epigenetic reprogramming). If we treat someone in thoose periods the consecuences could be very bad.</p></div>
