    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands leads to the silencing of genes. In general, CpG methylation occurs when a Methyl group is deposited and bonds to a cytosine. The enzyme that lays down the methyl group is DNMT3a. Another enzyme, DNMT1, is responsible for recognizing and methylating hemi-methylated DNA. In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and this leads to the silencing of tumor suppresor genes. This aberrant behavior is possibly the result of a change in the chromatin architecture and the silencing of the tumor suppressor eliminates a defense mechanism that when active stops a cell from dividing out of control.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells, and hypomethlated in cancer cells. The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells  contributes to the genomic and structural stability of the chromosome. This is achieved by silencing the repeats (through methylation) in order to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference and by mutating the methylated cytosines to the more stable thymines. On the othe hand and since cancer cells are hypomethylated, they tend to be genomically unstable leading to unusual chromosome recombinations and activation of repeats and transpositions.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can occur by either the hypermethylation or the hypomethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICR) depending on the ICR. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the normal paternal cell has an expressed Igf2 protein due to the hypermethlation of the ICR and has a silenced H19 gene. On the other hand the normal maternal cell has a silenced Igf2 gene due to the hypomethylation of the ICR and an expressed H19 gene. The Igf2 gene is expressed when the ICR and H19 gene are hypermethylated and this hypermethylation leads to the inability of CTCF to bind with the ICR and insulate the enhancer that promotes the expression of Igf2. On the other hand, the Igf2 is silenced when the ICR and H19 gene are hypomethylated and the CTCF can bind to the ICR and insulate the enhancer form the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR and H19 gene is hypermethylated which leads to the expression of the maternal Igf2 gene along with the paternal one. This over expression is often a precursor to neoplasm.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomehtlyating agent that functions by inhibiting the methlytransferase enzymes (enzymes that deliver the methyl groups). In doing so, it basically inhibits methyl groups from binding to cytosines and methylation to carry on. Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect when the tumor in question grows due to improper methylation or hypermethylation. Thus, in limiting and regulating methylation, tumors that arise from aberrant methylation are abated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has the astounding ability of being passed down through generations. This heritability extends the effect of DNA methylation for longer periods and is achieved via enzymatic mechanisms within the cell. Methylation is usually associated with gene silencing through packing of the DNA which leads to a limiting of the access to loci. Alterations in methylation, therefore, can lead to unintended overexpression or silencing of certain genes. In addition, methylation sites may be bound by proteins (MBDs) that recruit chromatin remodelers to the locus; thus, altering the structure of the chromatin itself. </p>
<p>Methylation is also most prone to change during certain periods. These periods are called sensitive periods and are namely periods of epigenetic reprogramming that occur during gametogenesis and after reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. During those periods, it would be ill advised to treat patients with epigenetic drugs since this variability that results from epigenetic reprogramming can extend the effects of the drugs to offspring. The effect might be uncontrolled and harmful epigenetic alterations in offspring.  </p></div>
