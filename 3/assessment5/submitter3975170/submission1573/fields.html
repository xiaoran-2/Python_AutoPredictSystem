    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually methylated less than the rest of the genome and are often found around promoters of genes that are common to various cell types.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells, CpG islands often become more methylated as the disease progresses.</p>
<p>This may disrupt normal cell function by deactivating essential genes. It can also cause loss of imprinting, either silencing or expressing a gene from both parental alleles instead of just one, depending on the kind of imprinting. This can cause tumor growth by if expression of growth suppression genes is decreased, or expression of growth promotion genes is increased as a result.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements comprise most of the genome and are usually methylated and inactive, because their content is not needed and may even be disruptive to normal cell function.</p>
<p>In cancer they become less methylated and this causes genomic instability. When cells divide, chromosomes may recombine improperly due to repetitive elements being shared between them. Mutations like chromosome insertion and deletion may also occur, doubling their active genes or removing them completely.</p>
<p>These kinds of mutations in the genome can disrupt normal cell functions and cause growth of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally in the paternal chromosome the relevant ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF binding, so the downstream enchancers go on and activate Igf2. In the maternal chromosome the ICR is unmethylated so CTCF binds to it which prevents enchancers from going up to Igf2 and they only activate H19, which is unmethylated too.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the ICR is abnormally methylated in both alleles, so enchancers activate Igf2 in both cases. This causes a double dose of Igf2, which promotes growth of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation of promoters of growth suppressor genes deactivates them, which encourages growth and causes formation of tumors. By reducing methylation, the drug can stop this.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inherited when a cell divides, so any changes in methylation caused by drugs will persist in future child cells.</p>
<p>Normally methylation is maintained and kept constant, excluding certain periods in development, called sensitive periods. One of these periods is in primordial germ cells from their development up to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The other one is from pre-implantation to early post-implantation. During these periods active reprogramming of epigenetic marks occurs and this process is sensitive to the environment.</p>
<p>Drugs that alter normal methylation processes could interfere with the reprogramming process in significant ways. This could cause infertility if the reprogramming of developing primordial germ cells is interfered with. And if given to a mother with a recently implanted fertilised egg, it could cause abnormalities during future development of the zygote.</p></div>
