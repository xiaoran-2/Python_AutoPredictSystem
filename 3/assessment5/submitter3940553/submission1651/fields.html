    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine reduces gene expression. It has been found in every vertebrate examined. In adult somatic cells,DNA methylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context; non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embryonic,stem cells.Of all epigenetic modifications, hypermethylation, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leading to gene silencing, has been most extensively studied. However, global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis.New information concerning the mechanism of methylation and its control has led to the discovery of many regulatory proteins and enzymes. . As methylation occurs early and can be detected in body fluids, it may be of potential use in early detection of tumors and for determining the prognosis. Because DNA methylation is reversible, drugs like 5′-azacytidine, decitabine, and histone deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a variety of tumors. Novel demethylating agents such as antisense DNA methyl transferase and small interference RNA are being developed, making the field of DNA methylation wider and more exciting. CpG islands are also found outside gene promoters, occurring both in inter- and intragenic regions. The function of these CpG islands is less well known, but their overlap with conserved regions among different species suggests that they may be part of distal regulatory regions and enhancers. Their pattern of DNA methylation in normal and cancer resemble that observed for promoter CpG islands, but with a higher frequency of methylation in normal cells. Also, a fraction of inter- and intragenic CpG islands may represent promoter regions of unknown transcripts, or an alternative transcription start site of tissue-specific (or developmental stage-specific) gene variants.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Parental allele is methylated for imprinting. Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother (e.g. H19 ), or in other instances from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father (e.g. IGF-2). Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in insects, mammals and flowering plants. Maternal allele is not methlated like parental allele differing in expression. Prader-Willi syndrome is  associated with loss of the chromosomal region 15q11-13. This region contains the paternally expressed genes and the maternally expressed gene (UBE3A).</p>
<p>Imprinting is a dynamic process. It must be possible to erase and re-establish imprints through each generation so that genes that are imprinted in an adult may still be expressed in that adult's offspring.  The nature of imprinting must therefore be epigenetic rather than DNA sequence dependent. In germline cells the imprint is erased and then re-established according to the sex of the individual, i.e. in the developing sperm (during spermatogenesis), a paternal imprint is established, whereas in developing oocytes (oogenesis), a maternal imprint is established.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class I-specific HDAC inhibitors entinostat (MS-275) and mocetinostat (MGCD0103) induced LAT2 expression specifically in AML1/ETO-expressing cells, resulting in induction of several activating histone marks on the LAT2 gene, including trimethylation of histone H3K4. The combination of entinostat and decitabine increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4, as well as LAT2 mRNA expression, in an at least additive fashion. In conclusion, several repressive histone modifications mark the LAT2 gene in the presence of AML1/ETO, and LAT2 gene derepression is achieved by pharmacological inhibition of HDACs. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by stoping the replication process.In this way the chances of cell dicsion and consequently cancer are reduced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenomem through regulating gene expression.Sensitive period is the period between epigenetic reprogramming and the start of the next developmental cycle.There are difeerent sensitive periods. During sensitive periods there are chances of developing the disease so it should be avoided.</p></div>
