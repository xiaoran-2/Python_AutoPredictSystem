    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation consists on adding a methyl group (-CH3) to a cytosine, usually followed by a guanosine. It is associated with gene silencing. Methylated DNA binding proteins, which repress transcription or recruit some other factors to play that role, bind to the methylated cytosines. Most CpG dinucleotides are usually in clusters called CpG islands, forming the gene promoters. In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, allowing gene expression. However, cancer cells show a hypermethylation at the CpG islands (and shores) regulating tumour suppresor genes, which control the growth of the cell. This leads to the silencing of those genes, so the mutated cells divide themselves more often than normal cells. In this way, the mutation is selected. This hypermethylation can be used as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of a specific type of cancer. In cancer cells, CpG poor promoters tend to be hypomethylated, activating different oncogenes that also contribute to abnormal cell growth. On the other hand, normal cells have methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These regions mantain genome integrity and their methylation prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters, transpotitions, recombinations and other genomic abnormalities. In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated (in general, the whole genome shows hypomethylation). This causes genomic instability (deletions, transpotitions, duplications, insertions...), causing mutations of the genome which can indeed lead to cancer. Altered DNA methylation also affects some type of molecules, such as piRNAs, directly transcribed from repetitive elements, which take part in gene expression and in the regulation of the epigenome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>An imprinted gene is a gene which shows monoallelic expression based on parent-of-origin of each particular allele. These genes are controlled by an imprint control region (ICR) which can be either methylated or unmethylated. Methylation at these sites does not necessarily mean that the imprented gene will be silenced. The H19/lgf2 cluster is found at chromosome 11 of the human genome. In normal cells, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele, so it is paternally imprinted. When the ICR is unmethylated, an insulator protein called CTCF can bind to it so that the enhacers located downstream the Igf2 gene cannot act on it. As a result, Igf2 is not expressed. Instead, the enhacers act on H19, a long non-coding RNA situated downstream the ICR. When the ICR is methylated, the CTCF cannot bind to it, enabling the expression of Igf2. The methylation of the ICR spreads to the H19. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele becomes methylated, so Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. This gene promotes the growth of cells, so cells with this epimutation start to grow and eventually form tumours.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>There are several types of epigenetic drugs, most of them in clinical or preclinical trial. Decitabine is a drug which has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a cytidine analog which is inserted in DNA and binds DNMTs after replication (it is replication dependent). However, it is still unknown how it leads to hypomethylation. It is also unclear if it has long term effects on normal cells. It is normally used for treating acute myeloid leukemia, although it has been tested in solid tumours as well. It is toxic if it is taken in great amount, but small doses have good results in terms of DNA demethylation. The drug causes the demethylation of hypermethylated tumour suppressors genes, which regulate the growth of the cell, having an anti-tumour effect.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Unlike other types of epigenomic regulators, DNA methylation is passed from a cell to the daughter cells during cell division. This methylation pattern does not disappear until it is actively erased. So the drugs may have an effect on the cancer cell's epigenome which stop the abnormal growth of the cancer cell, even if it does not "heal" the cancer (for example, if that specific cancer is caused mainly by genomic mutations). The tumour grows more slowly, so chemotherapy has a greater effect on the affected cells. Sensitive periods are periods when DNA methylation is erased and reestablish. Each specific type of tissue may have its own sensitive periods, but overall, the main sensitive periods are two: a pre-implantational period in early development and during primordial germ cell development. This means that, in the case on females at least, this period includes childhood, as oocytes are still developing. Therefore, it would be unadvisable to treat children with these drugs because their gametes' epigenome might be affected, and that would have consecuences on their offspring. This treatment should also be avoided during pregnancy or just before it, as it might affect the embryo.</span></p>
