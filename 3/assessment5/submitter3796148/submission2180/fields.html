    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often situated at promoters of genes. So their methylation means silencing of gene expression (e.g. inactive X-chromosomes show DNA methylation in CpG islands). Firstly, MeCP proteins have DNA-binding domain and transcriptional repression domain, besides they can recruit other factors that condense chromatin. Secondly, MECpG can prohibit binding of transcription factors.<br /> In tumour cells CpG islands are hypermethylated, what leads to tumour suppressor silencing. It looks like mutation (deletion) to tumour suppressor genes, but more frequent. In addition, as any repressor mark it leads to problems with DNA repair.</p>
<p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic integrity and stability. Silencing of repeats is necessary to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent illegitimate recombination. Moreover DNA methylation is mutagenic (meC to T); it can also protect genome from thansposons.</p>
<p>In cancer locus specific DNA is hypomethylated (e.g. in OCRs in can lead to loss of imprinting), but genome-wide DNA is hypomethylated. Firstly, it causes genomic instability. Secondly, it can activate oncogenes (e.g. R-RAS in gastric cancer), activate cryptic promoters and disrupt to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted). H19 lncRNA is produced only from unmethylated maternal allele: it works like a reservoir for a particular micro RNA. On the maternal allele ICR is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF (insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers). On the paternal allele DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without it DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access lgf2 to activate. So lgf2 is produced only from paternal allele.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Cdkn1c is a tumour suppressor, lgf2 is an oncogene. If maternal like allele behaves like paternal one, there are too large lgf2 and no Cdkn1c (Cdkn1c is produced only from maternal allele) expression. So, it promotes growth but there isn’t inhibiting growth at all at least based on these two genes. There are different reasons: mutations, unipaternal disomy, and some epigenetic cause. But as a consequence of it we get Backwith Wiedemann syndrome: fetal and post-natal overgrowth and predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours (e.g. Wilm’s tumour).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, also classified as an "antimetabolite". Decitabine is an analogue of the nucleoside 2’-deoxycytidine. After phosphorylation in organism and direct incorporation into DNA it inhibits of DNA methyltransferase.<br />DNA demetylation in promoter restores gene expression. In tumour cells CPI in promoters are hypermethylated, what leads to gene silencing, in particular of tumour suppressor genes. DNA demetylation in promoter restores gene expression. So tumour suppressor genes can control cell growth. It also can induce apoptosis of injured cells. This promotes normal specialization and blood cell growth, so that the body is better able to make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery are not specifict: they not only correct epigenetic disorders, but also influence all epigenetic state. For example, there are regions in normal cells like repetitive elements or intergenic regions that should be methylated. Hypomethylating agents can remove methylation even from here. So it’s necessary to use DNAMTi-drugs in a very small dose not to make them toxic for organism.</p>
<p>The environment has the greatest effect on epigenetic control during periods when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled. Firstly, it’s the period of primordial germ cells development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms, and secondly, preimplantational and early implantational periods.</p>
<p>One epigenetic marks need to be cleared, others should be resettled. Influence of drags can lead methylation, hystone tail modification disorders in all tissues and loss of natural cell division, development and differentiation. So, it will be better to use drugs that target the epigenetic machinery at an adult organism to correct epigenetic disorders and not to disturb its development.</p></div>
