    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy mammalian cells, the cytosine base is methylated in 70 – 80% of CpG dinucleotides.  The prevalence and function of DNA methylation differs among components of the genome.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Intergenic regions</span> are typically methylated – a modification that may mask cryptic start or splice sites.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Repeated elements</span> are methylated irrespective of their position relative to active genes.  This reduces the risks of transposition, illegitimate recombination, and prevents certain repeats from functioning as promoters.  Methylation of both intergenic regions and repeats enhances genomic stability.</p>
<p>CpG clusters, termed CpG islands (CGIs), are found at many gene promoters.  CGIs are <em>usually</em> not methylated, even when the associated gene(s) are not active.  A major exception is in X-chromosome inactivation; CGI methylation helps maintain XCI by blocking transcription factor binding or providing a binding site for MeCP proteins proteins and initiating a sequence that results in condensation of the chromatin.</p>
<p>Epigenetic dysregulation in cancer may stem from mutations in epigenetic enzymes, critical lncRNAs, or other genetic or epigenetic mutations that disrupt nuclear structure or ordered cell division.  Disordered replication can exacerbate genetic and epigenetic instability — beginning a vicious cycle of genetic and epigenetic mutations, with progeny 'selected' for unfettered proliferation.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer</strong> one observes genome-wide hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation, which worsen as the cancer progresses.  Diminished methylation of repeats and intergenic regions allows more rearrangements and transpositions to occur.  Cryptic promoters are unveiled.  Some genes are activated, others down-regulated. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation at CGIs and CGI shores occurs frequently in tumors. With certain cancers CGI methylation silences a single critical "tumor suppressor" gene that (usually in concert with another inherited or acquired "insult") steers the cell on a path to malignancy.  In other tumors, notably those of the CIMP phenotype, CGIs of a large set of genes are methylated and silenced.  The targeted genes typically include "tumor suppressors" involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, epigenetic regulation, etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster is paternally imprinted – that is, the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span>mprint <span style="text-decoration:underline;">C</span>ontrol <span style="text-decoration:underline;">R</span>egion of the paternal allele is methylated.  The region is organized thus (5' → 3'):</p>
<p> <em>Igfr2</em> gene – ICR – <em>H19</em> promoter / gene – Enhancer region</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Methylation of the paternal ICR spreads downstream to silence the <em>H19</em> promoter.  The enhancer regions are preferentially brought in proximity to the <em>Igf2</em> gene promoter, triggering expression.  The gene product is ultimately translated yield IGF2, an important fetal growth factor.</p>
<p>In the normal maternal allele the ICR is not methylated.  An insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the unmodified ICR and inhibits interaction between <em>Igf2</em> and downstream enhancers.  Instead, the enhancers interact with the <em>H19</em> promoter.  Transcription of the lncRNA <em>H19</em> helps stabilize the arrangement. </p>
<p>After birth <em>Igf2</em> expression is sharply down-regulated in most tissues. </p>
<p>Perhaps 40% of Wilm's tumors display biallelic <em>Igf2</em> expression.  That may arise from paternal uniparental disomy or from a mutation or epimutation leading to methylation of the maternal ICR. [<em>Igf2</em> is also up-regulated in tumors.  And <em>Igf2</em> introns encode miRNAs implicated as oncogenic factors.]  Overexpression of a growth factor is common in tumors – driving more rapid, unrestrained, cell growth and proliferation.  </p>
<p>Thus, disruption of imprinting at <em>H19/Igf2</em> leads to a "double dose" of IGF2; reversal of post-birth down-regulation amplifies that effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (a deoxycytosine analog) is classified as a hypomethylating agent (DNMT1 inhibitor).  The phosphorylated compound is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA.  Cancer cells undergo rapid replication.  When decitabine is integrated into a CG pair that is methylated in the parent strand, DMNT1 will endeavor to maintain the epigenetic mark.  But nucleophilic attack at the 6 position of the mock cytosine residue leads not to a transient intermediate but a stable covalent bond – blocking further DNA synthesis and irreversibly inactivating the enzyme.  Replication is compromised and DNMT1 continually depleted.  The effect may exacerbate the general hypomethylated state of the cancer genome, weakening the resilience of some cells.  But the primary benefit of DNMT inhibitors is to lessen locus-specific silencing of "tumor suppressor" genes.  That may render the tumor more vulnerable to chemotherapeutic or even immunological assaults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are, by definition, mitotically heritable.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">In cancer</span> fidelity of transmission is diminished.  But during a given round of cell division <em>most</em> genetic and epigenetic information is preserved — including accumulated tumorigenic mutations and epimutations.  </p>
<p>In cancer, aberrant methylation of CGIs (and CGI-poor promoters) silence critical "tumor-suppressor" genes.</p>
<p>Hypomethylating agents (DNMT inhibitors) interfere with the maintenance of DNA methylation.  When malignancy is fueled by silencing the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes, or by disrupting monoallelic expression of a key imprinted gene, relieving that pathogenic methylation may blunt unfettered proliferation and render the cancer more susceptible to "conventional" chemotherapies.</p>
<p>Because activity of DNMT<em>i</em>s is replication-dependent the drugs preferentially effect tumors.  But other tissues, during "sensitive" periods of development, may suffer devastating damage.  DNMT<em>i</em>s are contraindicated throughout pregnancy.  Two intervals – periods of epigenetic remodeling – represent exceptional vulnerability.  In the span from fertilization though gastrulation most epigenetic marks are cleared and subsequently must be reinstated.  The second sensitive period corresponds to reprogramming in primordial germ cells.  In PGCs marks are cleared from the entire genome, including imprinted genes.  Many are reestablished in late gestation – this sensitive period wanes by birth.  But oocytes are maintained in a haploid state unmethylated at ICRs until puberty; prepubescent girls might be considered sensitive to effects on future progeny. </p></div>
