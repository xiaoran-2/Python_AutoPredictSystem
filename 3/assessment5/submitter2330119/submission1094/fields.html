    <h1>Submission 1094 from Anon (session_user_id: f9d939b7ace27853fbadd5e9ea8d13d8bdfec273)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-CdR) is a DNA methylation inhibitor. Treatment with Decitabine leads to it being incorporated as a nucleoside analog into Genome wide DNA of cells during replication and it then inhibits DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferases onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell. This drug induced reduction of DNA methylation causes growth inhibition in all dividing cells. In the case of cancer cells its use has an anti-tumour effect in that the reduction in DNA methylation results in the re-activation of tumour suppressor genes aberrantly silenced. </p>
<p>The ability of Decitabine to be incorporated into the global Genome DNA raises concerns regarding its potential toxic effect on normal cells. However, as it only acts on dividing cells, it should mainly target rapidly dividing tumour cells and have minimal effects on most normal cells which divide relatively slowly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It has been found that disruption of imprinting is common in a wide range of human cancers of both embryonic and adult origin.</p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypomethylation or  hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes thereby leading to cancer.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour is an example of hypermethylation of an ICR region resulting in a cancer tumour.</p>
<p>In the IGF2 H19 cluster the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele -  it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. In the maternal allele, CTCF act as an insulator and binds to the ICR, enabling the enhancers to act on H19. This also means that  Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, and there is no expression. The paternal allele is methylated and the enhancers act on IGF2  (CTCF is not binding to the ICR) thereby expressing IGF2. However, with loss of imprinting hypermethylation takes place on the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Expression of of Igf2  on the maternal allele doubles the amount of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. As Igf2 is growth promoting it is a causative factor in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Whilst most of the CpG sites in the genome are methylated, the majority of CpG islands usually remain unmethylated during development and in differentiated tissues. During development some CpG island promoters become methylated resulting in long-term transcriptional silencing, X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting of genes. </p>
<p>The repetitive genomic sequences that are scattered all over the human genome are heavily methylated, which prevents chromosomal instability by silencing non-coding DNA and transposable DNA elements. </p>
<p> Cancer initiation and progression are accompanied by changes in DNA methylation. A cancer epigenome is marked by genome-wide hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island promoter hypermethylation. </p>
<p>Global DNA hypomethylation plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and occurs at various genomic sequences including  intergenic regions and repetitive elements. DNA hypomethylation at repetitive eelements leads to increased genomic instability by promoting chromosomal rearrangements and can lead to the activation of growth-promoting genes and a loss of imprinting in tumors. Thus, DNA hypomethylation leads to aberrant activation of genes and non-coding regions via mechanisms that contribute to cancer development and progression. </p>
<p>In contrast to hypomethylation, which increases genomic instability and activates proto-oncogenes, site-specific hypermethylation contributes to tumorigenesis by silencing tumor suppressor genes. These genes are involved involved in cellular processes, which are integral to cancer development and progression, including DNA repair, cell cycle, cell adhesion, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Epigenetic silencing of  tumor suppressor genes can also lead to tumor initiation. In addition to direct inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, DNA hypermethylation can also indirectly silence additional classes of genes by silencing transcription factors and DNA repair genes. Silencing of DNA repair genes (e.g BRCA1 etc.) enables cells to accumulate further genetic lesions leading to the rapid progression of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Pharmaceutical drugs that alter DNA methylation can cause persistent epigenetic changes. Induced epigenetic changes can be inherited during cell division (mitosis), resulting in permanent maintenance of the acquired phenotype that last beyond the period of drug treatment. </p>
<p>Prior to complete cell differentiation and the persistence of a stable epigenetic pattern, there is a sensitive period during which prenatal exposure to drugs can alter the elaborate DNA methylation patterning required for normal tissue development. Imprinted genes may be a particularly susceptible target for drug induced epigenetic effects. The early developmental period is thought to be the most sensitive time for drug induced DNA methylation changes because the DNA synthesis rate is high and the elaborate DNA methylation patterning and chromatin structure required for normal tissue development is established at that time. It would therefore be inadvisable to treat pregnant women with such drugs as it could lead to multiple adverse effects on the developing embryo.</p>
