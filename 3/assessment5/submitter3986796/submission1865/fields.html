    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands in promoters of genes is associated with silencing of those genes, either via the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or by preventing transcription factors from binding to promoters. Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer, CpG islands in the promoters of tumour-supressor genes are often hypermethylated. The hypermethylation (silencing) of these gene's promotors can contirbute to the development of cancer, as DNA methylation can be considered as one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with genomic integrity. Normally, reptitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in order to silence transposition within the genome and to prevent transcriptional interference from the strong promoters of transposons (it also prevents illegitimate recombination between repeats). In cancer, hypomethyation is observed at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This lack of methylation results in the absence of the mentioned silencing, and therefore genome instability. This leads to the disruption of genes, whether that means the silencing of tumour-suppressor genes or the upregulation of oncogenes. And this can contribute to the development of cancer. Thus, in cancer, DNA methylation is more prevalent than usual in CpG islands and less prevalent than usual in the genome in general (including in intergenic regions and repetitive elements).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contains the Igf2 gene, an imprint control region (ICR), the H19 gene, and enhancers. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. The CTCF insulator protein binds to it, and insulates the Igf2 gene from the enhancers by preventing the preferred loop with the enhancers from occurring. Instead, the enhancers loop to enhance H19 expression. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and as a result the CTCF protein cannot bind to it. This in turn results in the Igf2 gene not being insulated from the enhancers, and therefore it is expressed (while the H19 gene is not). In Wilm's tumour, the ICRs of both alleles are methylated, and thus both act like paternal alleles expressing the Igf2 gene (thus loss of imprinting). Igf2 is associated with growth promotion, and therefore when it is overexpressed this contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNMTi (DNA methyltranferase inhibitors). As nucleoside analogues, they get incorporated into the DNA during replication. When the DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) arrives at that loci to copy the methylation pattern to the daughter strand, the DNMT binds irreversibly to the DNMTi. This inhibits the cell's ability to copy maintain methylation patterns. Because this process is replication dependent, and cancer cells replicate more often than healthy cells, cancer cells are more negatively effected by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. They therefore have a higher rate of cell death (in other words, an anti-tumour effect).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and it is associated with silencing gene expression. Therefore altering DNA methylation can influence gene expression, and this influence can be maintained beyond the period of drug treatment. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming. Epigenetic marks (such as methylation or acetylation) are wiped clean during these periods, and a new set of marks are layed down (however there are instances where some epigenetic marks are not removed, and this is known as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance). The two main sensitive periods of development are during primordial germ cell development and early embyonic development. Because epigenetic changes as a result of drug treatment are mitotically heritable, and because epigenetic marks are particularly susceptible to changes during sensitive periods, treating patients with drugs that target epigeneetics during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable. The drugs could effect unintended targets, and have potentially negative consequences for the patient and/or that patient's germ cells.</p></div>
