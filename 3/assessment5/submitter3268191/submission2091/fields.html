    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG-Islands are reagions of the  genome of eukaryotes with statistically elevated density CpG dinucleotides density within the eukaryotic promoter. CpG islands are well used for regulating the expression of genes, and are thus an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. Methylation of CpG islands of a gene means that these genes are not read (gene repression). Because of its symmetry it can be maintained through cell division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Abnormal DNA methylation of CpG-rich sections of DNA in promoter regions can lead to the repression of tumor suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes. Methylation at a tumor suppressor gene leads to silencing it. In cancer the CpG islands are more likely methylated (CpG island hypermethylation).  Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable it is a very effective way of silencing. CpG-island methylation progresses with time and gets more and more while the tumor is extending. Compared to other cells in that tissue, the tumor cells with silenced tumor suppressor gene have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally  methylated to maintain genomic integrity. Loosing methylation at integenic regions can lead to abnormal karyotypes, e.g. chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. The methylation of intergenic regions also silence cryptic transcription start sides or cryptic splicing sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Methylation at repetitive elements is also to maintain genomic integrity. They are silenced to prevent transposition and to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promotors. The methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions tent to be hypomethylated. This  leads to genomic instability. A consequence might be chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations because of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promotors or disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is on the human chromosome 11. The imprinted control region is unmethylated on the maternal allel. In its unmethylated form it can be bound by CTCF (insulator protein). It insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. These are free to raise the expression of H19.</p>
<p>The imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allel, the H19/lgf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. CTCF cannot bind to the imprinted control region when it is methylated. The enhancers are free to bind Igf2 and enhance its expression. H19 is methylated too, due to hetrochromatin spreading and therefore silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor, a child kidney tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated. The maternal allel is now methylated too. The consequence is Igf2 expression from both allels.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene, which promotes growth. Overexpression in cells leads to unnatural growth and can result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a cytidine Desoxynucleosidanalogon, and functions as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. As a DNA-demethylating agent it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>In low doses it selectively inhibits DNA methyltransferases DNMT, leading to Gene promoter hypomethylation. When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Promotor hypomethylation results in reactivation of the Tumor suppressor genes, and induction of cell differentiation, or senescence followed by programmed cell death.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors are all nucleoside analogues. They are incorporated into the DNA and bind irreversibly to DNMTs even during replication. Because of the dependency for replication for the inhibitors to have an effect, cancer cells are more severely affected since they are dividing more often.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p title="Embryonic stem cell">DNA-methylation is an important component in cellular processes, like genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and preservation of chromosome stability. Errors can lead to a variety of devastating consequences, including several human diseases. DNA methylation stably alters the exppression of genes in cells as cells devide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are actively remodeled.</p>
<p>The periods that are sensitive are those of primodial germ cell development to the production of sperms and matured eggs (so during childhood), the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. These are periods of active remodeling of the genome. At that time the genome is most sensitive to the environment.</p>
<p title="Genomic Imprinting">Treating younger patients who are developing germ cell (sensitive period) with DNA-altering drugs would be inadvisabe, because the afereffects would not be predictable but permanent and unidirectional during the period of somatic maintenance. It could influence not only cancer cells, but also a variety of cellular processes. The long term side effects can’t be forseeable.</p></div>
