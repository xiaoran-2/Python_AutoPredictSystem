    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics refers to those heritable changes in gene expression that occur without a change in the nucleotide sequence. Epigenetic changes alter the way in which genes are expressed. Among the major changes found DNA methylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation occurs in CpG dinucleotides, which can be grouped in<strong> CpG islands</strong>. These regions are generally found in gene promoters and are generally unmethylated. Methylation in these dinucleotide has the function of regulating gene expression. This methylation is critical in the silencing of genes, gene imprinting, heterochromatin formation and inactivation of the X chromosome. Methylation causes gene inactivation through mechanisms such as the formation of a chromatin repression structure or preventing binding of transcription factors.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions</strong>. These regions are normally methylated. It is believed that its main function is to maintain genomic integrity silencing, probably,transcription  start sites or cryptic splice.</p>
<p><strong>Repeated elements</strong>. Are generally methylated. Its main function is to maintain genomic integrity silencing either repeated elements to prevent the transposition, transcriptional interference by strong promoters or preventing recombinanción.</p>
<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
<p>The main characteristics of epigenetic dna methylation are: Locus specific DNA hypermethylation ( CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes and  ICRs loss of imprinting) and Genome wide DNA hypomethylation (Repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters, ICRs – loss of imprinting).</p>
<p><strong>The CpG islands</strong> are hypermethylated. This results in silencing tumor suppressor genes and over expression of oncogenes and deregulation of tissue specific genes and imprinting genes. There is also the hypermethylation of CpG islands shores. Also  the chromatin structure is afected.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions</strong> and  <strong>repeated elements</strong>  are hypomethylated in cancer. This results in genomic instability. What produces  deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions kariotypes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The conceptualization of cancer as a genetic disease led to consider that epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation can intervenirse chemically. This led to the development of drugs that have effects on the epigenetic machinery. Among them is the Decitabine.</p>
<p><br />Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Thia agent acts Interfering DNA methylation by the DNA-methyl transferase and  inducing hypomethylation. This results in the restoration of the function of genes that are critical in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation such as tumor suppressor genes and therefore in controlling the cell cycle. It also has cytotoxic effects by forming adducts with DNA methyl transferase. Decitabine hava no effects in non dividing cells. This drug is  aproved by FDA in the treatmen of <span>myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome that can be inherited to daughter cells until the epigenetic marks disappear. For example, a cancer cell treated with a epigenetic drug like Decitabine can have various effects on it. In a short period of time can reactivate genes related to the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. In the long term these changes are inherited to daughter cells, reestablishing the normal cell cycle.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is that one where epigenetic marks are  removal between generations to restore totipotency (Epigenetic reprogramming). There are two sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. The first one is the preimplantation period and early development where there is DNA demethylation and histone marks removal. The other is the sensitive period  is the priordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>The treatment in these phases is appropriate because there is a reset epigenetic marks, allowing reset them normally. If in a tumor cell exist a  hypermethylation pattern and this cells were treated with a hypomethylatin drug  at this stage you can restore the normal pattern. First favoring the expression of tumor suppressor genes and then resetting epigenetic marks, which in  turn can be inherited to daughters cells</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic regulation mechanism that establishes a differential  sex specific pattern of methylation of the genetic material that is inherited. The establishment of these patterns determines the expression of certain genes in one of the parental chromosomes but not the other.</p>
<p>The H19 gene is active on the maternal chromosome and inactive in the parental, while IGF2 is active on the paternal and inactive in the mother. Both are controlled by the imprinting control region (ICR), which is methylated on the maternal chromosome and methylated on the paternal.</p>
<p>The insulator protein CTCF binds to demethylated ICR  on maternal allele and isolate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This enhancers, then acts on H19 promoting its expression. When ICR is methylated in paternal allele CTCF is unable to bind and therefore is not able to isolate, by acting on both enhancers increasing Igf2 expression.</p>
<p><span class="hps">Mutations and</span> <span class="hps">deletions may</span> <span class="hps">promote loss</span> <span class="hps">of imprinting causing that the maternal allele behaves as the paternal. This promote Igf2  overdose and cell growth and loss of tumor suppressor genes like the CDKN1C. Loss of imprinted patterns cause fetal and postnatal overgrowth, macroglossia and predisposition to childhood tumors such as Wilms tumor.</span></p>
