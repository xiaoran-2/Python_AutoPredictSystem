    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, whether the genes associated with them are active or not (Takai, Jones, 2002) . Interons and repeated groups are also methylated. The reverse happens in cancer. CpG islands tend to be methylated while interons and repeated groups are unmethylated (Feber., Wilson., Zhang, et al., 2011). CpG sites are cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides. DNA methylation forms between the nucleic acids cytosine and guanine, the cytosine being upstream of the guanine (Herman &amp; Baylin, 2003). Regions of dense CpG population are called CpG islands. When these islands are methylated, this fixes the closed state of the gene, effectively silencing it. Frequently, 5-methylcytosine spontaneously deaminates to produce a thymine mutation. Hence, in cancer, methylation of CpG islands can silence or mutate many critical genes, such as tumor suppressors. Also, hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic areas can over-activate growth factors and nonsense transcriptions.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of methyl groups in the Igf2 cluster causes loss of imprinting in Wilms’ tumor (Feinberg, 1999). There is also greater variation in the amount of demethylation across tissue samples compared to normal tissues (Hanson, Timp, Bravo, et al., 2011). Changes in nuclear positioning of chromosome 1 and 16 may occur in Wilm’s tumors (Qu G-Z, Grundy PE, Narayan A, et al, 1999), with resulting in changes of activity of oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The imprinting of the Igf2 and its growth factor is up-regulated in Wilms’ tumor (Vu, Chuyen, Li, et al., 2003). Reverse-order maternally imprinted antisense transcription Igf2-AS also occurs, in equal proportion to Igf2. In tumors studied, Igf2-AS was imprinted if Igf2 was imprinted. However, when there was loss of imprinting for Igf2, four of six tumors retained imprinting for IgfF2-AS. Some authors state that upregulation of Igf2 is caused by loss of heterozygosity (Moulton, Chung, Yuan, et al., 1996). Others maintain that heterozygosity is not required for up-regulation of Igf2 (Vu, Chuyen, Li, et al., 2003).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The demethylating agent Decitabine (Dacogen), 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine, is a cytidine analog which attached to DNA strands, blocks methyltransferase in order to restore hypermethylated DNA to its normal state (Wikipedia, Decitabine, 2013). This can enable silenced tumor suppressor genes to actively transcribe.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylating the DNA of a gene can silence it, closing it to transcription during the life of the cell unless demethylating agents open the DNA to transcription. During certain periods of development, gametogenesis and after fertilization, DNA methylation reprogramming occurs (De Carvalho, You, &amp; Jones, 2010). Other critical vulnerable periods, when cells are sensitive to epigenetic modification, include times of embryonic and placental development (Cortessis, Thomas, Levine, et al., 2012) (Feng, Jacobsen, Reik, 2010). Other periods include oocyte demethylation during female childhood (Faulk &amp; Dolinoy, 2011), postnatal periods and puberty. Treating patients during sensitive periods may interfere with development and differentiation, as epigenetic states are differentially tied to each period of development.</p>
