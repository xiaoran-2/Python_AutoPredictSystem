    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic marks. Thus, if incorrectly placed, there can be grave consequences.</p>
<p>Generally it is known that in normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated, since methylation of these CpG islands, usually found near promoters of genes, are almost always associated with gene silencing. Although not true for all genes, proper methylation is necessary to control the proper expression of the correct genes. In cancer, there are errors with the epigenetic machinery (random/accumulated), and what results is the hypermethylation of CpG islands, causing uncontrolled gene silencing/activation. Generally, throughout the genome, DNA methylations levels decrease, resulting in genomic instability and loss of ability to control tumour suppressor genes. The loss of control of tumour suppressor genes implies diseases (generally true), as uncontrolled cell growth and often a plethora of other harmful phenotypes result from the mutations and incorrect silencing of genes, including the infamous cancer.</p>
<p>The opposite is true for methylation in intergenic regions and repeats. In normal cells, these regions would be hypermethylated (since DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing), to protect the cell's genome from the expression of various gag pol and env proteins and from the detrimental and mutagenic effects from repeats and transposable elements (insertion into a gene is a mutation; we want to silence the bad genes). However in cancer, there is targeted hypomethylation of these repeats and intergenic regions, implying increased genomic instability and mutagenesis (questionably stable), yet the result of abbherent epigenetic machinery and improper methylation resulting in incorrect genes silenced. The underlying principle of disease can be condensed; the activation of oncogenes, and the inactivation of tumor suppresor genes, the result of either genetic or epigenetic errors and mutations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are ones that are only 'expressed' in one parental allele. Thus, either epigenetic or genetic mutations disrupting such genes can result in various diesases including cancer. In the discussed case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, mutations can result in tumours (e.g. Wilm's tumour). </p>
<p>Generally this cluster is paternally imprinted; the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. It also works by enhancer blocking. In the maternal allele, the inmethylated ICR allows for the binding of the protein CTCF, which blocks the enhancers from the Igf2 gene downstream, this activating the H19 gene (although H19 is irrelevant to causing cancer, it is a miRNA reservoir). However in the paternal allele, this protein does not bind. As a result of the heterochromatin spreading, the promoter of the H19 gene is also methylated (this H19 is not expressed from the paternal allele), and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is one example of how disruption of imprinted genes can cause cancer. When the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, it results in the appearance of two paternal alleles. With that is the upregulation of Igf2, which is an oncogene, promoting the growth of tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers have a knack to involve generally the suppression/mutation of tumor suppressor genes in combination with the overexpression of growth promotors and other factors. The fact that epigenetic marks can be treated chemically and are removable offers hope and possibilities to treat epigenetically related cancers and diseases. </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, used to treat myelodisplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. As its name suggests, the drug overall decreases the levels of methylation found throughout the genome. They do this probably by inhibiting various enzymmes that lay down these epigenetic marks, and are also overexpressed in tumour cells. Since abbherrent methylation may result in accidental silencing of tumor suppressor genes, there is hope that by inhibiting the enzymes that lay down these marks, the disease may be slowed down.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although epigenetic marks are not permanent, many if not all are mitotically heritable, thus unless cleared/reset or an error, the current epigenetic state will be maintained.</p>
<p>Throughout a human's life, there are two sensitive periods, of when the epigenome is being cleared. Sensitive periods (in relation to epigenetics) are defined as when the epigenome is more susceptible to errors and mutations, also during periods of clearing the epigenome. </p>
<p>There are two periods of resetting of the epigenome, both occuring in very early live. The first is the pre-implantation period, between the zygote and the blastocyst. The second is after implation during primordial germ cell development. During these periods the epigenetic machinery work to clear the epigenetic marks while maintaining the marks of some other parts (e.g. repeats) of the genome. All this happens to ensure cell totipotency in the next generation. </p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during this period as the drugs may have unknown or harmful effects on various epigenetic complexes and mechanisms, resulting in improper clearing and resetting, potentially resulting in disease (due to the mechanism of action of the drugs).</p>
