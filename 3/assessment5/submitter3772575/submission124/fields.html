    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is important for regulation of gene transcription. CPG islands are normally unmethylated to prevent silencing of expression of  gene promotors so proteins required by the body can be produced.</li>
<li>In some diseases like cancer, transcriptional silencing of genes occurs due to CPG hypermethylation  which results in silencing of genes such as tumor supressor genes so may contribute epigenetically to cancer development if other carcinogenic factors exist.</li>
<li>human intergenic regions (REs) are generally highly methylated to maintane chromosome structure and genome integrity for example by preventing exepression of genes in opposite directions via RNA polymerases.</li>
<li>methylation of repeptive eliments is also required for maintinance of genomic integrity for example by silencing of repeats to prevent transposition &amp; to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition and prevent illegitimate recombination.</li>
<li>one of the biomarkers of human cancers and of cardiovascular disease is REs &amp; repetitive eliments  hypomethylation &amp; genomic instability.</li>
<li>hypomethylation of REs/repetitve eliments is more common than hypomethylation of CPG poor promoters which results in Genomic Instability via allowing Illegitimate recombination between repeats, Activation of repeats and transposition and Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</li>
<li>exampe: Human disease - mutations in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome, where genomic instability is a characteristic feature.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Methylation of the paternal allele at ICR blocks binding of CTCF insulator protein so DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate which is oncogene and growth promoting gene.</li>
<li>While unmethylation of the maternal allele at ICR allows CTCF insulator protein to insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</li>
<li>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes results in increased cell growth and tumor formation such as Wilm’s tumour at which Hypermethylation of ICR and Igf2 overexpression occurs.                                                                                                                          So, loss of DNA methylation at ICRs is common in cancer.</li>
<li>Aberrant expression of imprinted genes results in specific diseases, for example: overdose Igf2 results in fetal and post-natal overgrowth (Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome).</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is an anti-cancer "antineoplastic" or "cytotoxic" chemotherapy drug.Decitabine is classified as an "antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent as it inhibts DNMT.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransfrases. It can only be incorporated into DNA strands not RNA strands.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.One way that it works is by <span style="text-decoration:underline;">demethylation</span> or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.                                    Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called <span style="text-decoration:underline;">antimetabolites</span> which are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.        </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip jig-ncbipopper">Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand <span style="text-decoration:underline;">genomic instability</span> and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand <span style="text-decoration:underline;">silencing of tumor suppressor genes</span> – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.                                                                 another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores. These regions were initially identified hypermethylated in colorectal cancer and represent regions of tissue specific methylation in normal tissues . Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors</li>
<li>sensitive periods are: Periods of epigenetic reprogramming at which environment can affect epigenetic make up and epigenetic hertability can be transfared to the offspring. {so, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable}.</li>
<li>
<div dir="ltr">Sensitive periods are: primordial germ cells formation, pre &amp; early post implantation peroids when active remodiling of epigenome occurs and during <span>embryogenesis/gametogenesis</span> when marks are established rather than maintained.</div>
