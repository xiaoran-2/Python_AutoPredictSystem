    <div class="field-value"><p>Abnormalities are due to two different mechanisms are in a state of hypomethylation of DNA and site-specific hypomethylation of the genome in normal and abnormal cases for DNA hypermethylation. The genome is methylated by repetitive elements in the same intergenic regions and introns of cancer cells. CpG islands are now more likely to be methylated. They are not all methylated, but is more likely to be methylated to a normal cell. And the rest of the genome, including repetitive elements, and the elements intergenic and introns are indeed hypomethylated CpG islands are found in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. Could do it genetically or epigenetically could happen by silence tumor suppressor gene, thus blocking in its active state and since the mitotically DNA methylation is heritable. It means tha that this is a good locking mechanism down in terms of epigenetic silencing. DNA methylation is maternically hereditary, so it is effective way to silence a tumor suppressive gene and these epimutations can indeed be selected quickly. So silencing tumor suppressor gene will allow to have a particular cell competitive advantage over others in surrounding tissues. then, over the period of time that the cells have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly or not to die as much. The DNA hypermethylation is reversible, adn this is very important becasuse if they in this case hypermethylation.  DNA methylation and cancer occurs frequently results in consequence to the cell, but is reversible. Hypermethylation is more frequent than genetic mutation. The cancer progress have increase methylation od CpG islands that are associated with tumor supressor. Thus, it can very useful diagnosis and prognosis. it is known that cancer is just a consequence of aging, perhaps we are all in a kind of pre neoplasic state slightly as we age.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cell is loss of imprinting. One of the possible causes of cancer is the silencing of genes are expressed in growth. These genes act as growth promoters or suppressor. So, not only found hypermethylation of the imprinting control regions in cancer. If paternal alele is methylated and maternal no, we have high level of IgF2. IgF2 acts in promoting growth, adn this is associated with the Wilm's tumor. In this particular case, analyzing the genome kidney child. Then, the loss of imprinting, is observed ina wide variety of tumor types. And, in fact, occurs as an event pre neoplasic tissues. This suggests tha perhaps these events in imprinting control regions, such hypermethylation or hypomethylation events can occur early in tumor events </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drug that inhibits the enzme that acts on histone deacetylase, resulting in decrease of tumor</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lunf cancer. Although it is too early to say for sure, Dr. Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cell in some lasting way that made them more suceptible to standard chemotherapy. That is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand-daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>
