    <h1>Submission 87 from Anon (session_user_id: 98ff0e90f56f844ae368ce4f33491759a1d37926)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Decitabine inhibits the activity of the EZH2 enzymes that attach methyl groups to histones.</p>
<p>2. Enzymatic overactivity induces supression of genes, including the tumour supressor genes. Decitabine prevents this.</p>
<p>3. A DNA-demethylating agent is compound that can inhibit methylation, resulting in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes [1].</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. DNA methylation can maintain its patterns in the daughter cells, thus altering the DNA methylation can have lasting effects on gene expession. </p>
<p>2. A sensitive period is a limited timeframe when certain progenital cells are formed.</p>
<p>3. In emryos this is around midgestation, later in adolescence (girls 8-12, boys 9-13 years) this process is continued (germ cell maturation, Sertoli cells in males).</p>
<p>4. Treating patients during sensitive periods may disrupt normal germ cell formation and result in infertility or future embryo malformation.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span>1. </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span>In genetics, </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><strong><span>CpG islands</span></strong></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span> or </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><strong><span>CG islands</span></strong></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span> (CGI) are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. The "p" in CpG refers to the phosphodiester bond between the cytosine and the guanine. Unlike CpG sites in the coding region of a gene, in most instances the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated if the genes are expressed. This observation led to the speculation that methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression. </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>2. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>in cancer. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span><span>3. DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue.</span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>4. DNA methylation normally contributes to the gene expresion. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. [4] </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>5. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes is now firmly established as an important mechanism for gene inactivation. [5]</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span>6. CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumor type. Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), p14(ARF)), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13), detoxification (GSTP1), etc. [5]</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

<p><span>1. </span><span>Wilms' tumo</span><span>u</span><span>r or nephroblastoma is cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults. Its common name is a namesake. </span><span>[1] H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, found in humans and elsewhere. </span><span>[2] On the paternal allele, downstream gene enhancers act to promote ig</span><span>f2</span><span> growth factor expession, while H19 gene and its promoter are methylated.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. On the maternal allele, the same enhancers promote H19 expression, acting on CTCF promoter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. and 4. In Wilms` tumour,  H19 expression is silenced on both alleles, whereas igf2 is expressed on both. This results in double measure of growth factor expression and hence excessive tissue growth. [3]</p>
