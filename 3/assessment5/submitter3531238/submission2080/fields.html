    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG clusters often forms CpG islands at the genes promoters. Methylation of this islands and their shores leads to silencing of current gene.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there are both hyper and hypomethylation occurs. Hypermethylation occurs at gene promoters and hypomethylation occurs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Locus-specific hypermethylation of genes promoters leads to silencing tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul><li>GSTP1 hypermethylation occurs in prostate cancer cells,</li>
<li>miR-34b/c hypermethylation associated with metastasis,</li>
<li>MGMT hypermethylation associated with glioma.</li>
</ul><p>Imprint control regions hypo or hypermethylation can lead to loss of imprinting. This can happen in two ways: loss of expression of growth restriction genes or in overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions, genes introns and repetitive elements methylation usually play role in silencing and mutagenic process. This helps to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>Depending on the location of hypomethylated regions in genome the consequences may be different.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. This can be transpositions, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, cryptic promoters activation and illigitimate recombination.</p>
<p><span>CpG poor promoters <span>hypomethylation </span>may lead to oncogene activation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is the form of DNA-demethylating agents. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </span>Decitabine belongs to DNMTi (DNA methyltransferases inhibitors) class of epigenetic drugs.</p>
<p>Have good effect on haematological malignancies, becouse they are dependent of hypermethylation on tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine is nucleoside analog and it binds irreversible with DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases, that lays down methylation markup) after they are incorporated into DNA. This leads to demethylation of tumor suppressor genes promoters.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. It's state maintains by DNMT1 protein throughout the life. </p>
<p>Sensitive period in this case is time when epigenetic drugs can alter normal epigenetic state. This is early development (during fetus development), and in childhood, when primordial germ cells are still develops.</p>
<p>Decitabine and it's analogs not very specific drugs and can have long-term effects on the normal cells. Also, mechanism of their action still unclear. For younger patients using this drugs <span>would be inadvisable becouse of impact they has on germ cells. </span>For older patients primary aim of treatment is patient survival. Therefore side effects are not as important as for the younger.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells paternal ICR is methylated and CTCF protein can not binds to it. DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it. Enhancers acts on Igf2 and causes it's expression.</p>
<p>Maternal ICR is unmethylated, and CTCF binds to it as insulator protein. Enhancers act on H19. Igf2 silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor ICR and H19 promoter is hypermethylated, i.e. methylated in both maternal and paternal allele.</p>
<p>This leads to overexpression of Igf2 (double dose of gene).</p>
<p>Igf2 involved in the cell's interactions and growth stimulation. Therefore it's overexpression is common feature in some <span>tumours</span>.</p>
