    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are  in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. It could do so genetically, or it could happen epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene. DNA methylation can be one of the hits of cancer to occur.</p>
<p>But hit and take out one tumor suppressor or perhaps one copy of the two alleles of a tumor suppressor,  is not sufficient to cause tumor regenesis. We need to take out both copies of the tumor suppressor. Other hits, will need to occur and the cell will end up rather than dying, going on and forming a chimer. So, DNA methylation and consequent epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes can be  one of hits. CpG island hypermethylation, an associated gene silencing, occurs really frequently in tumors. This is probably because DNA methylation is maternically inheritable, so it is a very effective way of silencing a tumor supressive gene. And these epimutations can be rapidly selected for. <br />Silencing a tumor suppressor allows that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues. Then over a period of time the cells that have this epimutation are more likely to divide more rapidly or to not die as much. And therefore they will take over. And this is  how  cancers eventuate.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation  is more frequent that genetic mutation. This isn't true for every tumour but it is  extremely frequent. Hypermethylation of particular CpG islands or CGIs varies by tumor type. While one tumor type may hypermethylate one set of CpG islands that belong to tumor suppressor genes, a different tumor type may hypermethylate a different set of tumor-suppressor gene promoters or CpG islands. And this has been discovered looking at the methylation genome-wide.</p>
<p>As the cancer progresses we get increased methylation of CpG islands that are associated with tumour suppressors. Epigenetic mistakes accumulate.Hypermethylation can do the same job as mutation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We can find hypermethylation and also hypomethylation of imprint control regions in cancer. Depends on the particular imprint control region and the function of the genes that are found within the control region. CpG island tends to be unmethylated but in tumor cells methylated.</p>
<p><br />In the IGF2 H19 cluster is the imprint control region methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so no  expression. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to intulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting and  high hipermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele, on these maternal allele, we have expression of Igf2. So a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with <strong>Wilm's tumour</strong>.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types. And occurs as a very early event, so it's often seen in preneoplastic tissues.</p>
<p>Recently discovered was hypermethylation of regions surrounding CpG islands, CpG island shores.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Targets the enzymatic epigenetic regulators.</p>
<p>Decitabine is very similar to 5-Azacytidine,which inhibits DNA methyltransferase one.They're nucleoside analogs. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and  when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. The action of these drug is division dependent, the cell must be replicating. Cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.</p>
<p>This drug is used at a low dose to kill the tumor cells. All cells -normal too- have the potential to be affected. We don't know if they have other mechanism of action as well.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>The drug cause DNA demethylation and you actually have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, you kill the tumor cells. But it affects  all dividing cells to some extent, and so, we don't know what the long term consequences would be on normal cells, that will divide at same point.</p>
<p>Younger patients,  may have developing germ cells  in sensitive periods when takings cancer drugs.The sensitive period is a period where the drug can have intergeneration effects in the epigenetic machinery. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p>In epigenetic reprogramming, the genomically imprinted genes are programmed between generations.The largest time periods of epigenetic reprogram, considering the genome in general, are during early development and during primordial germ cell development.The differences in germ cell chromatin and the different gene expression signatures need to be removed before the next generation's can develop.  We have removal of much of the DNA methylation, and  the histone marks throughout the genome. After this stage, we have resetting of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>TheEpigenetic marks are re-established in a lineage specific fashion. Each lineage has its own set of epigenetic marks,  associated with the particular gene expression patterns that are required with each lineages.</p>
