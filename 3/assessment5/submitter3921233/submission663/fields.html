    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually, DNA methylation at CpG islands silences gene expression - it therefore often occurs at promoters of genes. In cancer-patients, there occurs both locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. DNA hypermethylation can silence tumor repressor genes and therefore promote cancer. The effect of DNA hypomethylation depends on the location: in repeats and intergenic regions, it leads to genomic instability; in CpG poor promoters, oncogenes are activated. Usually, repeats and intergenic regions are inactive and hence not expressed. Hypomethylation of those regions can lead to the activation of repeats and transposition and thereby activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighbouring genes. Genomic instability leads via deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations and illegitimate recombinations between repeats to an abnomral karyotype where cancer-promoting genes. In the case of disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can both be due to hyper- and hypomethylation and result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes or the overexpression of growth promoting genes. In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) of the Igf2/H19 cluster is methylated in the paternal allele in unmethylated in the maternal allele. Therefore, in the maternal allele, CTFT can bind to the ICR and enhancers make H19 be expressed whereas Igf2 is silent. In the paternal allele, CTFT doesn't bind to the ICR and therefore enhancers act on Igf2 and make it be expressed. In a Wilm's tumour cancer cell, also the maternal ICR is methylated (-&gt; hypermethylation) which is why CTFT doesn't bind and in both alleles Igf2 gets expressed and H19 is silent. Igf2 is growth-promoting which is why a double dose of Igf2 leads to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, an epigenetic drug, is a D</span>NA-demethylating agent to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukaemia. The chemically cytidine analog can be incorporated both in DNA and RNA chains and  hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. By demethylating the DNA at the right loci, previous abnormal hypermethylation can be revoked and/or tumour supressor genes can be demethylated and therefore activated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While parts of the epigenetic marks are reset during early development (fertilised egg -&gt; blastocyt) and during germ cell development (primordial germ cells -&gt; gametes) (the process is called epigenetic reprogramming, the mentioned phases of development in which epigenetic marks are removed and reset are the so called sensitive periods), DNA methylation in repeats (IAPs) is usually not reprogrammed during the sensitive periods (and at imprinted regions only during the second sensitive period) and therefore inherited even over generations. Altering DNA methylation can thus even be sustained over generations, but especially at cell division within one live span. If thus DNA methylation is altered due to drugs, those marks are not immediately reerased but rather stay in the cells and their daughter cells. If an altered epigenetic mark makes one more susceptible to standard chemotherapy, those effects endure. Treating patients during sensitive periods would mess up a lot the epigenetic reprogramming during those time spans as most probably not only the re-demethylation to revoke a hypermethylation or the other way round (which the drug is meant for) will be the effect, but a general hypomethylation at the locus - if not also at other places in the genome.</p></div>
