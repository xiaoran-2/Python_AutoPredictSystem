    <h1>Submission 1150 from Anon (session_user_id: 49e99e6bd1703a699fa2bd2b86c1783e082e7daf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an <strong>hypomethylating agent</strong> which is normally used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. It is chemically a cytidine analogue. It's mode of action for treatment against various tumors lies in its ability to insert itself into<strong> DNA</strong> after phosphorylation and from thereon inhibits the action of <strong>DNA Methyltransferase</strong>. It inhibits DNA methylation invitro and mostly at doses that doesn't supress overall DNA methylation.</p>
<p>After using decitabine, the meoplastic cells attain normal functional genetic makeup especially those genes which play a major rolein cellular differentiation and proliferation. It doesn't act on quiescent cells. It's cytotoxicity on dividing cells though is assumed to be due to it being able to form covalent adducts after incorporation into DNA with DNA Methyltransferase thereby inhibiting methylation of DNA.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA metylation patterns have a varied effect depending on the time at which they are modified. If they are modified during sensitive periods, these changes become part of the genome which will then be passed on to the progeny i.e. they become transgenerational in nature. That is why pregnant mothers are refrained from smoking and various other vices as these have the ability to change the epigenomics of the child and may hence harm the progeny.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development during which enviromental factors can influence the epigentic makeup of an organism. These are periods where the genome is most vulnerable and hence can be easily changed.</p>
<p>The main senstive periods during development have been identifed as :-</p>
<p>1. from primordial germ cells to the gamete formation stage and </p>
<p>2. pre implantation and postimplantaion stages (fertilized egg, blastocyst, epiblast).</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would result in permanent epigenomic changes which could even be carried on to the progeny. Treatment at these times when the patient is vulnerable to epigenomic changes will result in various changes in the genome some of which may be destructive or have a negative impact.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA Methylation at CpG islands acts normally to reduce transcriptional noise; i.e. it tags areas of the genome which are not to be transcribed. These include areas coding for carcinogens and normal developmental processes like x-chromosome inactivation and supression of repressive elements.</p>
<p>In cancer, various CpG islands are  seen to be abnormally hypermethylated or hypomethylated. Hypermethylation is normally seen in the regulatory sequqnces of genes leading to uncontrolled proliferation of cells which is the characteristic of cancer and leads to gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation meanwhile has also been implicated in causing various malignancies.</p>
<p><span>While epigenetic changes are required for normal development and health, they can also be responsible for some disease states. Disrupting any systems that contribute to epigenetic alterations can cause abnormal activation or silencing of genes.</span></p>
<p>DNA methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally present to maintain the genomic integrity and especially to protect the genome form trasposable elements. This includes silencing of cryptic transcription start sites, methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination and so on.</p>
<p>Hyper or hypomethylation of above mentioned sites leads to the improper and uncontrolled proliferation of cells due to improper transcriptional silencing and or transposon integration and hence results in cancer.</p>
<p>Disruption in methylation patterns which are normally seen will reult in various diseases due to improper transcription and illegitimate recombination and so on.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele Igf2 is nonimprinted and is favourably inherited.</p>
<p>In maternal allele Igf2 is imprinted and not inherited normally.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumour, the Igf2 is expressed at higher levels than normal and also in most cases is expressed biallelically and the H19 are expressed at very low levels (almost undetectable) and in most cases shows loss of heterozygosity (LOH) i.e. there is preferential loss of the maternal allele at chromosome 11. That is it can be said that there is activation of the paternal Igf2 allele while there is silencing of the maternal H19 allele.</p>
<p>Abnormal imprinting in Igf 2 and H19 can result in various diseases. 2 of these are:-</p>
<p>1) Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome often results from changes in  methylation that affects the ICR1 region. Specifically, hypermethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene activity and increased activity of the <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene in many tissues. </p>
<p>2) In Russell-Silver syndrome, the ICR1 region often has too few methyl groups attached (hypomethylation). Hypomethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene activity and increased activity of the <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene in many tissues. </p>
