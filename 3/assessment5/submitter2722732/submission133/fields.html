    <h1>Submission 133 from Anon (session_user_id: 718ed37fb28f9be84bd094358db895d61cb69300)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and is targeted at myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>It has been identified that the enzyme EZH2 (in a lot of lymphomas) is overactively methylating. Which subsequntly has the effect that the genes that are methylated get "silenced". Among the "silenced" genes are tumour-suppressors, thus promoting uncontrolled growth - a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine being a DNA-demythylating drug its purpose is to "reset" methylation marks that may have been set by e.g. EZH2. Tests on a related drug (GSK2816126) in lab have demonstrated that the drug on cell cultures and lab animals removes the methylation and inhibits the proliferation of tumour cells without any impact to nearby normal cells.</p>
<p>As epigentic modifications are mitoticaly inheritable, once a cell has been "cured" future daugther cells will have the correct methylation marks (i.e.behave as non-cancel cells), thus reducing the tumour. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotic heritable, i.e. that they are passed on during cell division to daughter cells, and these changes remain active during future cell devision.</p>
<p>The changes are reversable, thus it is possible to erase the changes, but changes require active erasure. Thus it might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>Epigeneric therapies need to consider sentitive period, which is "a period of epigenetic reprogramming". I.e. the clearing (DNA demethylation) and resetting (DNA methylation) of epigenetic marks. Different gene types have different reprogramming:</p>
<ul><li>Sensitive period for maternal and paternal genomes are during "early embryonic development" (before the zygote has implated) and "germ cell development" (during embryo development and pre-adulthood).</li>
<li>"Repeats / IAPs" have no sensitive period, i.e. no substantial demethylation occurs for these genes.</li>
<li>Sensitive period for imprinted genes is during "germ cell development"</li>
</ul><p>As the setting and resetting of epigenetics marks occurs during sensitive periods. Any treatment that targets epigenetic marks during a sensitive period for a gene will have a lasting effect on that genes function for future daughter cells, due to the mitotic heritability of epigenetic changes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The primary epigenetic effect known is DNA methylation, and changes to this is identified as a cancer indicator.</p>
<p>In normal cells (mostly) the DNA is hypomethylated at the CpG islands, i.e. that the CpG islands are not methylated. For cancer cells this is reversed, i.e. that the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated.</p>
<p>Methylation of the CpG islands has the effect of silencing the gene following the CpG island, and in cancer cells the methylation of the CpG islands impacts silencing of e.g. tumour suppressor genes. With the tumour suppressor genes silenced the cell be able to exibit tumour behavior such as uncontrolled cell division, avoiding to die etc.</p>
<p>For intergenic and repetitive regions in genes of normal cells the DNA is methylated. Methylation of the intergenic region has been seen to stabalize the genome, but it is also to some degree used for silencing gene expresion.</p>
<p>Repetitive regions are associated with transposal genes that through "copy / paste" or "cut / paste" are changing the genome. Thus methylating the repetitive regions is done to silence transposal genes and also to silence the promotes that can activate other then the transposal genes  through the strong promotes that are part of the repetitive regions (the LTRs)</p>
<p>For cancer cells this is reversed, so that the intergenic and repetitive regions are hypomethylated (i.e. not methylated). This leads to genome instability (due to lack of methylation of the intergenic region) and activation of the transposal genes and activation of other genes (due to lack of methylation of the repetitive regions). Genomic instability is known to be an important cancer cause, also activation of genes due to the strong promotes of repetitive genes will modify the cells normal behavior (could also lead to cancer).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic of imprinted genes occurs by DNA mythelation of ICRs (imprint control region). This controlls the activation / silencing of genes on either the maternal or paternal allele.</p>
<p>For the H19/Igf2 cluster the epigenetics in normal cells is as such:</p>
<ul><li>On the maternal allele the ICR is demethylated. This allows for CTCF protein to bind to the ICR, which blocks downstream "enhancer" from activating the Igf2 gene, i.e. Igf2 is not expressed. Instead the H19 gene is additionally expressed by the "enhancer".</li>
<li>On the paternal allele the ICFR is methylated. The methylation of ICR blocks CTCF protein to bind ICR, thus the downstream enhancer enables the expression of Igf2. The methylation of ICR via histone modification also methylates the CpG island of H19 thereby silencing it.</li>
</ul><p>Wilm's tumour is a disease due to abnormalities in expression of Igf2 and Cdkn1c. The two genes are in close proximity on chromosome 11. Cdkn1c expression is controlled by Kcnq1 cluster, and is maternal imprinted.</p>
<p>Thus e.g. Uniparental disomy will result in Igf2 being overexpressed and Cdkn1c not expressed at all. Igf2 is a growth promoter and Cdkn1c a growth suppressor, thus leading to excessive growth, a hallmark of cancer.</p>
