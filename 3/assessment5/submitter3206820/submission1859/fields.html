<p class="hg-tinymce-code">CpG islands which are regions with high quantity of CpG dinucleotides and are ubicated in more than half of gene promoters in the genome. This CpG islands usually are free of methylation. A feasible function to keep CpG islands in promoters free from methylation could be to try to make this regions more stable avoiding a mutagenic pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;">The studies in cancer have revealed that it is common to find the promoters CpG islands hypermethylated in different kinds of cancer.  This altered cells are able to divide and to produce descendant cells with the same altered epigenetic pattern.</span><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;"> </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;">In consequence of this fact, this altered cells are having a abnormal gene expression because lots of genes, which don't have to, are being silenced. Some of this gene can be involved in apoptosis, DNA repair, controlling cell cycle, etc. This is one of the reasons that make the cancer cells genomically inestable, they lost the control of cell cycle and became inmortal. </span><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;font-weight:bold;line-height:42px;"> </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;">In human beings is common find the intergenic regions and repetitive elements methylated in the genome. </span>The function of <span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:16.2px;line-height:42px;">intergenic region</span>methylation could contribute to give stability to the genome. In the repetitive elements the function is mantein the integrity in the genoma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">The cancerous cells have a global hypomethylated pattern, intergenic regions and repetitive elements appear hypomethylated.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">The hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements trigger unstability in the genoma in cancerous cells. They are going to be more susceptible to transposition, abnormal karyotype, transcriptional interference and to illegitimate recombination. This cells are going to have a altered expression pattern, will altered its functions and the control of its own cycle.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele we can find the ICR (imprinting control region) methylated, this fact inhibit binding between CTCF factor, without this binding this methylation can spread to H19 promoter that it is downstream, silencing H19 expression. Then enhancers can bind to Igf2 promoting its expression.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele we can find the ICR demethylated, CTCF can bind to ICR, this protein insulates the access of enhancers to Igf2, then this enhancers bind to H19 promoter, H19 has expression.</p>
<p>In this tumor the cells have maternal allele with the same profile expression than paternal allele, thus they have double levels of Igf2, it is a growth promoting. </p>
<p>This disorder can be caused by mutation or by delection. Can also be caused by uniparental disomy, two copies from the parental chromosome (paternal imprinting).Can be caused by epigenetic disruption, in the sensitive periods the genome the enviroment can cause variations in the epigenetic pattern at this cluster level.</p>
<p>Cells from Wilm’s tumour have a oncogen active producing double of Igf2, this factor is activating the growth. This is responsible of the fast growth of cancer in patients (this cancer has embryonic or childhood predisposition) and the tumouration in itself.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, It is a drug which belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, they carry out desmethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">In presence of Decitabine the cells in division are going to replicate its genome without any methylation, we know the replication of DNA is a semiconservative process, </span></span>with any division the methylation (previous treatment) is being diluted.</p>
<p>In this line of thinking, the tumoral exposure to Decitabine will dilute its methylation in general, affecting in lots of spots to the focal hypermethylation which appear proper to tumoral cells, as CpG islands in promoters. If this regions are restoring slowly its epigenetic normal pattern, is restoring his normal expression and the appropiate behaviour of this cells.</p>
<p>It is a clear anti-tumoral effect</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA demethylating agents act inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), blocking the new methylation. Tumoral cells are characterised by high division rate, every single division in this conditions, is dissolving the methylation in a passive desmethylation process. Then promoter CpG islands would start to become more desmethylated as happen in healthy cells, some silencing gene in tumour are reactivating after treatment with this drug, making possible to the cell to acquire a intermedial altered epigenetic status, stable through generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods, are periods of time in the development of a organism when it is more susceptible to change his/her epigenome by the influence of altered enviroments.</p>
<p>In mammals we can find two sensitive periods, one of them goes from gametes to epiblast (embryogenesis), another goes from the development of primordial germ cells to the gametes development (gametogenesis).</p>
<p>We don’t know the effect to treat with this kinds of drugs (can alter epigenome) in sensitive periods as would be treat children or pregnant women, it could produce alterations gametes and in the fetus, respectively. We know in this sensitive periods the epigenetics marks are established, therefore interference in this process could have unknown effects, with high probability an adverse effect.</p></div>
