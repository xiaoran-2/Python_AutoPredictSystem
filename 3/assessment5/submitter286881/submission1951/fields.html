    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are not methylated, and these promotor genes can initiate transcription as usual.  However in a cancer cell, the CpG island is more likely to be hypermethylated.  This hypermethylation represses transcription of the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, leading to gene silencing.  This gene silencing gives the cell the ability to potentially progess to cancer.  This hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumors, and is both mitotically heritable and rapidly selected for, causing the tumors to grow.  A few examples of genes in which CpG island hypermethylation leads to cancer are: RB (retinoblastoma); MLH1 (colorectal cancer); BRAC1 (breast cancer); MGMT (gliomas) </p>
<p>In a normal cell, the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are methylated, and therefore inactive.  However in a cancer cell, the intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements are more likely to by hypomethylated.  Activation of these promoters as a result of this hypomethylation genome wide, contributes to chromosomal instability, leading to enhanced tumorigenesis.  This chromosomal instability leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, for example: deletions; reciprocal translocations; and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, as CTCF is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR silences H19, and prevents binding of CTCF, which allows enhancers to access Igf2, resulting in Igf2 expression.  However on the maternal allele, CTCF blocks enhancers from accessing the promotor for Igf2, and they instead promote H19 expression.  The expression of Igf2 is imprinted because it is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene (growth promoting).  Sometimes, as a result of a mutation or deletion, there is a loss of imprinting.  If imprinting is disrupted, and the maternal allele is no longer expressed, the result will be too much Igf2 expression, leading to potential tumor growth.  This over expression of Igf2 can lead to Wilm's tumor by promoting tumor growith.  This loss of imprinting will also result in a decrease in expression of H19.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA Methyltransferase) inhibitor.  By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine causes hypomethylation.  Decitabine irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.  Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because the DNA methyltransferase is bound, can no longer be released, and this inhibiting effect of the drug is division dependent.  Cancer cells, which divide more rapidly than normal cells, will be much more effected by the action of Decitabine, and the inhibition will be maintained through each mitosis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the methylation is sustained and maintained through mitosis.  The daughter cells will have the same methylation marks as the originally targeted cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development that is sensitive to environmental signals, and epignetics marks are established.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development include blastocyst development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because at these times, methylation is being reset.  It would not be advisable to treat with drugs until the epigentic marks are set.</p></div>
