    <h1>Submission 1556 from Anon (session_user_id: aed2547ec39d8978747f4072309502ea97b1b513)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">Decitabine can generally be described as a DNA-demethylating agent. More specifically, it inhibits DNA methylation by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase and that leads to hypomethylation.It is also a nucleoside analogue. It is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are <span>the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. DNA methylation is a mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells by switching on and off various genes. When DNA methylation is increased this can result in silencing some tumor suppressor genes which are crucial in controlling cell division and growth. Then, cells start dividing rapidly and that can lead to cancer. Decitabine intervenes in that mechanism by inhibiting DNA methylation so that the normal function of tumor suppressor genes is restored. That means that these genes can control cell growth again. That's how Decitabine works and shows an anti-tumour effect in specific types of cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">There are drugs that affect in the long term the epigenetic makeup of a patient by altering DNA methylation. That can happen because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. A sensitive period means that epigenetic reprogramming can occur. Reprogramming happens when epigenetic marks ,such as DNA methylation, are being erased and remodelled again. There are two sensitive periods during which reprogramming happens. More specifically, clearing of epigenetic marks occurs firstly in early development at the pre-implantation period and secondly during the primordial germ cell development. Different paterns of reprogramming are observed at the paternal and maternal genome. </span><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">Special attention should be given in patients who have developing germ cells in </span><span style="color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:20.4px;">sensitive periods. It is highly recommended not to treat patients during these sensitive periods because epigenetic alterations can be passed on to future generations and affect that way their epigenetic profile.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code" style="text-align:justify;">DNA methylation can occur at various spots and in different ways around the genome. More specifically, in cancer you can observe both DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation at different sites of the genome. CpG islands, inergenic regions and repetitive elements are the spots that altered DNA methylation patterns are being observed. Hypermethylation occurs in CpG islands in the promoter region of certain tumor suppressor genes and is associated with gene inactivation in cancer. Genome-wide hypomethylation refers mainly to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, induces genome instability and that way plays a key role in cancer. In normal cells CpG islands are not methylated in contrast to the intergenic regions and repetitive elements that are methylated. In cancer, hypermethylated CpG islands and CpG island shores lead to silencing tumor suppressor genes ,which are crucial in controlling cell division and growth, and subsequently cells start dividing rapidly and that contributes to cancer. It should be mentioned that hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumour type and also DNA methylation is reversible, a fact which is extremely interesting for therapy approaches. When it comes to genome-wide hypomethylation, it is observed in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and leads to genomic instability. Genomic instability entails abnormal recombination between repeats such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes ( Avy and Axinfu alleles ). Last but not least, another type of hypomethylation ,which is less common than hypomethylation of repeats, occurs in CpG poor promoters which leads to activation of genes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. Generally speaking, DNA methylation is altered in both ways (hypo and hypermethylation) at different regions of the genome in cancer and taking these procedures into account can help improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:justify;">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of imprinted genes. In a normal cell the ICR of the H19 gene is hypermethylated on the paternal allele and that means that H19 is silenced and Igf2 is expressed at the paternal allele. At the same time, the opposite happens at the maternal allele. More specifically, the CTCF protein binds to the ICR (imprinting control region) of the H19 gene, which stays unmethylated, and that means that the H19 gene is expressed at the maternal allele while the Igf2 gene is not expressed. The methylation patterns change in Wilm's tumour. A loss of imprinting of Igf2 occurs in that type of cancer. ICR of H19 gene is hypermethylated in both the maternal and paternal allele and as a consequence H19 is not expressed at all while at the same time Igf2 is overexpressed in both alleles. Wilm's tumour is cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children. </p></div>
