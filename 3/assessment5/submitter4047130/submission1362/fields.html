    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, generally there’s no methylation at the CpG islands. In general you find that the genome is methylated. In a normal cell, there are repetitive elements through the intergenic region and in the introns of genes. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are likely to be methylated. Usually they aren't all methylated, but they are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. In general, the rest of the genome is hypomethylated.  The methylation is swapped in terms of where the DNA methylation is found in normal cells and in cancerous cells. Different patterns of CpG island hypermethylation are associated with different disease prognoses and responses to therapy. CpG island hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumors. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Some examples of CpG island hypermethylation are <em>RB</em> in retinoblastoma, <em>MLH1</em> in colorectal cancer, <em>BRCA1</em> in breast cancer, and <em>MGMT</em> in gliomas and colorectal tumors. CGI methylation progresses with time.</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up of intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and others places where you would generally find that the CpG's were methylated in normal cells. In cancer, these regions tend to become hypomethylated, giving them less methylation then you would see in normal cells. Hypomethylation most commonly occurs at repeats. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions lead to genomic instability. DNA methylation makes sure genetically, the genome is stable. Illegitimate recombination between repeats results in reciprocal translocations between two chromosomes. In a normal cell, reciprocal translocation recombination would not occur because the repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatinized. In cancer, there is hypomethylation of the repetitive elements or the intergenic regions. Repeats can be activated by the hypomethylation which may activate neighboring genes resulting in additions, deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations. The role of DNA methylation depends on the tumor type and the stage of disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated. The insulator element, CTCF, binds to the ICR. As a result, the enhancers will act on H19, silencing the expression of Igf2.  On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated. The enhancers act on Igf2 because CTF2 is not binding to insulate the ICR. As a result, Igf2 is expressed. Wilm's tumor is a particular childhood kidney tumor. In a cancerous cell, there is hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele as well. Now on the maternal allele there is expression of Igf2 as well as on the paternal allele. This results in a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what is in a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting, which is associated with Wilm's tumor.  Overall, there is hypermethylation of the ICR and overexpression of Igf2 in Wilm’s tumor. Alteration in DNA methylation at imprint control regions can result in loss of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes causing disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company. Azacitidine and decitabine are DNA-demethylating agents used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Histone-deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat a rare illness called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Decitabine decreases the DNA methylation of cells in cancer. This activates tumor-suppressor genes whose job is to stop uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Researchers led by Stephen Baylin have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumor. Some who didn't show response to the trial went on to show good reactions to routine chemotherapeutic drugs they received next.It is too early to say for sure, but Dr. Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, historically the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome-wide lack of methylation. Altered DNA methylation patterns cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes. DNA hypomethylation initiates chromosome instability, while DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation is a feature found in all cancers ever studied, and was found more consistently than genetic mutations. Epigenetic control is important throughout development, and goes wrong in disease. The sensitive period is a period of development that is susceptible to environment signals. The sensitive periods in epigenetics are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Changes in the environment have the greatest effect on epigenetic control during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods during embryogenesis or gametogenesis are when marks are established rather than maintained. It would be inadvisable to treat cancer patients during sensitive periods because mitotic heritability of any epigenetic difference brought about by environmental change is required to see a sustained alteration. Treatment would be wiped out during the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Dr. Baylin predicts that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. </p></div>
