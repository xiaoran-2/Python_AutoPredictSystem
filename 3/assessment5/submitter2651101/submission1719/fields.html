    <h1>Submission 1719 from Anon (session_user_id: 9fb519bf0988b088c3914e3ba57af8636b077c10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 imprinting locus employs at least two mechanisms in order to ensure the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele and the expression of H19 from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the insulator model of imprinting the unmethylated maternal ICR binds to CTCF, preventing the access of Igf2 enhancers to Igf2 and favoring the expression of H19.On the other hand the methylated ICR on the paternal allele cannot bind to CTCF which allows Igf2 enhancers to favor the expression of Igf2.Moreover the methylation of the paternal ICR spreads to the H19 CpG promoters and blocks the expression of H19.</p>
<p>Another imprinting mechanism at this locus involves a long non-coding RNA. If the promoter of the ICR is methylated, the long non-coding RNA is repressed and cis-linked genes are expressed.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the ICR from both parental alleles is methylated leading to a biallelic expression of Igf2.The overexpression of Igf2 subsequently favors cell growth and accounts for a pre-neoplastic state, increasing the risk of childhood cancers, such as Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analogue able to irreversibly inhibit DNMT after it is incorporated into the DNA. As a result Decitabine is able to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes (since it inhibits DNA methyltransferases which were originally involved in the methylation of promoter regions from tumor suppressor genes).</span></p>
<p><span>The ant-tumor effect of Decitabine depends on whether that particular tumor is determined by silencing tumor suppressor genes, which is the case of hematologic malignancies. Moreover this effect requires active cell division since Decitabine should be first incorporated into the DNA.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation of CpG islands is associated with the decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes. In a similar fashion the incorporation of epigenetic drugs such as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have long term consequences on the DNA methylation in a large number of organs and tissues on the long turn. These genetic modifications will also have an impact on other epigenetic regulators.</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods refer to the specific phases during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These involve the early embryonic preimplantation period and primordial germ cell development (in humans these could be attributed to the early stages of development during childhood as well as during pregnancy).</span></p>
<p><span>Exposure to epigenetic drugs during these periods leads to<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>mitotically hereditable alterations of the epigenome and could thus affect following generations.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of various somatic mammalian genes is associated with gene silencing.</li>
</ul><p>      In normal cells CpG islands from promoter regions tend to be unmethylated irrespective of whether that specific gene is being translated or not. As a result these regions are less frequently subjected to spontaneous point mutations.</p>
<p><br />     In cancer cells CpG islands found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. Hence silencing of these genes induces dysregulations of the mechanisms that govern the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms.The methylation pattern of these CpG islands varies according to tumor type and more importantly DNA methylation tends to increase with tumorigenesis.Certain CpG islands display a particular increased DNA methylation pattern and are also known as CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype).In colorectal cancer CIMP correlates with a number of clinicopathological features ( patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability, MLH1 function and prognostic outcome).Therefore these methylated CpG islands could serve as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis ( as they are specific for a certain tumor type and its location), treatment and prognosis (since the increase in CpG island methylation parallels tumorigenicity).</p>
<ul><li>Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells is responsible for maintaining genomic stability.In particular methylation of the repeats silences these elements and in turn prevents potential transpositions throughout the genome as well as transcriptional interference.</li>
</ul><p>One of the earliest findings in any cancer cell involves genome wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats.As a consequence genome instability ensues, including reciprocal translocations, transpositions, deletions, insertions, the activation of cryptic promoters or neighboring genes.</p></div>
