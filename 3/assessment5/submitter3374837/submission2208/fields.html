    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is necessary for normal development and is associated with genome inprinting, X-Chromosome inactivation, supression of repetitive elements and carcinogenesis. Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called<em> </em>CpG islands which are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes. In disease processes such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene and secondly methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl CpG binding domain proteins (MBDs).  MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin i.e heterochromatin. In particular, loss of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett Syndrome; and methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MDB2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.</p>
<p><span>RNA polymerase transcribes DNA all over the place. Transcription factors just increase transcription at genes, but there is nonspecific transcription happening genome-wide.This nonspecific transcription is waste of time and energy by the cell which has finite resources and is potentially harmful if random DNA is transcribed that causes downregulation of a gene by RNAi pathways when it is not supposed to. So DNA methylation, which usually serves as a mark of transcriptional downregulation, helps prevent these deleterious consequences by preventing transcription from happening in places it has no business happening. Nonspecific transcription still happens, but probably at a much lower rate than it would otherwise.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the imprinted control region on the paternal allele is methylated hence its paternally imprinted. because of the methylated ICR the CTCF can't bind to ICR so no insulator action is there and the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and hence CTCF(insulator protein) can bind to it. there's a LncRNA produced just from maternal allele i.e H19 and it has nothing to do with the establishment of imprinting in this particular cluster. the CTCF binding insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. hence the enhancers are not working on the Igf2 and are free to act on H19 and enhance its expression on the maternal allele. this happens due to chromatin looping. the preferred loop is between enhancers and the Igf2 but when the CTCF blocks this by its binding to ICR, the enhancers loop to the H19. this shows that igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not from the maternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is a chemical analogue of the cytosine. Decitabine is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. As Decitabine is a deoxyribonucleoside, it incoporates into DNA. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>a sensitive period is such a period when the epigenetic makeup is influenced by environmental factors.</p>
<p>sensitive periods of development are 1) the period of primordial germ cell develpoment all the way through the production of mature gametes and 2) the preimplantation and early post implantation period which are period of active remodeling of the active genome.</p></div>
