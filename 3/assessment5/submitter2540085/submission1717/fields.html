    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation marks at the CpG islands present epigenetic <span class="hiddenSuggestion">modifications</span> that usually silence the respective genes. The hypermethylation of a region that <span class="hiddenGrammarError">should be</span> less methylated and vice versa can change the expression profile of a cell. This altered expression will result in altered function of the product and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the accumulation of</span> these ‘<span class="hiddenSpellError">epimutations</span>’ may lead to diseased state. In cancer, these epimutations may <span class="hiddenSpellError">hypermethylate</span> the tumor suppressor genes foregoing the growth suppression function or may hypomethylate the oncogenes resulting in overexpression of growth enhancing factors leading to the immortal phenotype. Both genome-wide hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation is generally seen in the cancers. The altered DNA methylation in upstream or downstream regions of the CpG islands may also <span class="hiddenSuggestion">contribute</span> to cancer and have a diagnostic as well as prognostic potential more efficient than gene expression or even CpG island epimutation profile of a cancer, alone. In normal tissues, the intergenic sequences and the repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated thereby inhibiting their activity or the disruption that they can cause by jumping around in the genome. The loss of methylation at these regions result in their transition from a closed, heterochromatin configuration to a more open, euchromatin configuration allowing the illegitimate recombinations between them. This may eventually result in genomic instability caused by the transpositioning of these regions as they may disrupt or overactivate a gene and its expression. The final effect depends on the type of gene affected, that is, <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the suppression of</span> tumor suppressor genes or <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the production of</span> a deformed product causing decreased growth regulation and <span class="hiddenGrammarError">the activation of</span> cryptic promoters regulating the oncogenes causing abnormally high growth of these cells. The therapeutic potential of epigenetic treatments therefore, highly depends on the epigenetic profile of the particular cancer and the stage of the cancer treated.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The imprint regions are methylated on one parental allele while unmethylated on the other. These differential methylation marks are required for the expression of a product in single dose, that is, from a single parental allele. For example, the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated at paternal allele which allows the enhancers to increase the expression of Igf2. However, it is hypomethylated at the maternal allele which allows the CTCF to bind to the insulator so the enhancers can increase the expression of H19 instead and therefore Igf2 is not expressed. The methylation is altered if the maternal allele gets hypermethylated resulting in expression of Igf2 from both alleles and a double dosage and activity of the oncogene product. This eventually leads to Wilm’s tumor, a childhood kidney tumor. In other instances, the expression from both alleles can also be inhibited</span>, which in the case of tumor suppressor genes, can lead to indefinite growth and thus, cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, is an FDA approved small molecule DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used for treating myelodysplastic syndrome (acute myeloid leukemia stage). It is a nucleoside analog which enters the genetic sequence upon replication of the DNA and binds irreversibly with the DNA methyltranferase, DNMT1 while it is setting up the methylation marks in the daughter strand. Since the activity of these inhibitors require the cell to be in the replicating stage, the cancer cells are more widely affected therefore, allowing targeted treatment resulting in much lesser side-effects. However, this specificity is only seen at low doses at which the readily replicating cancer cells are more susceptible to DNA demethylation than the normal cells. These inhibitors will cause hypomethylation and thus increased expression of tumor suppressor genes in the target (cancer) cells which will lead to cell death and thus, the regression of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Any change in the epigenetic mark in an individual is passed on to their generation and are thus heritable. A sensitive period is the time when epigenetic marks of an individual are being set, that are, the early embryonic development period and germ cell (GC) and, primordial germ cell (PGC) development periods. Any alteration during this period will be passed on to generations unless they are removed. The alterations maybe in response to certain chemicals such as a diet rich in methyl donors which may hypermethylate certain genomic regions and may also be nurture/stress-sensitive.  An epigenetic drug that causes alterations in the epigenome of a patient, may be unspecific during these sensitive periods causing genomic instability. This happens because the epigentic marks are being laid down and so the maternal affect proteins are not active to protect the genes from resetting marks. Also, the repeats which are usually protected and are only reset later during PGC development may be affected by the drugs. Furthermore, if the embryo survives, these non-specifically, highly altered marks will be passed doen to all the future generations.</p></div>
