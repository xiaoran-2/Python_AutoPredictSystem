    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is the addition of a CH3 group to the 5' position on cytosines. It happens most commonly when a cytosine is followed by a guanine - a CpG dinucleotide. Methylation is integral to imprinting, X inactivation, genomic stability and heterochromatin formation. </span></p>
<p><span>CpG islands are regions which have a high density of CpGs and are found in about 60% of promotor regions. Normal CpG islands generally do not show a lot of methylation regardless of their activity (X-inactivation being an exception). This allows transcription factors to bind to promotors located upstream of the gene.</span> In cancer cells these same CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, blocking the binding of transciption factors to the promotor region and resulting in the gene being silenced. Thus disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands in promotor regions contributes to cancer by silencing tumor supression genes.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally tend to be methylated. It is believed that methylation of the intergenic regions contributes to genomic stability. Without appropriate methylation in these regions chromosomal deletions, insertions, duplications and translocations have been observed to occur.  Intergenic region methylation is also known to be involved in the silencing of cryptic promotors and splice sites; thereby preventing transcriptional interference.</span><span style="font-size:14px;">Methylation of repetitive elements is also believed to contribute to genomic stability in a number of ways. Transposition is prevented by repeats being silenced or mutated from meC to T. Transcriptional interference by strong promotors is avoided, again through silencing of the repeats. It is also believed that methylation of the repetitive elements may prevent illegitimate recombination. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">In cancer, methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is often lost and so, consequently, is the genomic stability as described above. This hypo-methylation has been found in all tested tumor types.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) due to loss of imprinting has been found to result in an overexpression of growth promoting genes. This event is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, an early stage in tumour development. One example of how the disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer is seen in the overexpression of IGF2 in Wilm's tumor. In a normal cell the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. The insulator complex CTCF4 is capable of binding to the unmethylated ICF, preventing expression of IGF2 and allowing the enhancers to act on H19 for the maternal allele. As the ICF is methylated on the paternal allele, CTCF4 can not bind, the enhancers can act on it and IGF2 is expressed. However, in the case of Wilm's tumour, imprinting is lost and the the maternal allele ICR is hypermethylated as a consequence. CTCF4 can not bind to either ICR and IGF2 is now expressed from both the paternal and the maternal allele. The result is the double dose of growth factor associated with Wilms tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine, is a DNA-demethylating agent that is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes </span>and acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that becomes incorporated into DNA on replication. When DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) reaches the nucleoside analog to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it covalently and irreversibly binds with the analog, leading to passive demethylation during replication and cell division. DNA methylation is thus inhibited and an anti-neoplastic effect results. A number of mechanisms for this action have been observed including the inhibition of cancer "stem cells", <span>decreased genome-wide promoter DNA methylation, restored <span>pathways involved in the cell cycle and in cell repair, maturation, differentiation, and programmed death, gene re-expression</span> and <span>inhibited signaling in pro-tumorigenic pathways. Success with MDS suggests that </span></span>Decitabene may be acting on CpG island hypermethylation resulting in re-expression of tumour suppression genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As epigenetic changes, like DNA methylation, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells any alterations will have enduring effects on the epigenome. For example, if Decitabene removes CpG island hypermethylation from a cell resulting in the re-expression of tumor suppression genes then those genes will continue to be expressed in the daughter and granddaughter cells. During development there are two periods of time where the cell is more susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming and control. These times are known as the sensitive periods. The first is from primoridial germ call through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second is the pre-implanted and early post-implantation period of development. These developmental periods are when the major epigenetic reprogramming and remodelling occurs. Adding an epigenetically active agent, like a de-methylating agent, at these times could have extreme and unintended results on the epigenetic machinary. For example, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is caused by global hypomethylation of the blastocyst. The treatment of younger patients still undergoing germ cell development also needs to be considered with great care. The Overkalix cohort demonstrates what can happen when the epigenetic machinary is disrupted during this second sensitive period.</span></p>
