    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA     methylation exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotide in Mammals.  CpGs are usually clustered into CpG island, often at the promoters of genes. This is where transcription machinery     binds. So if there is methylation in these regions silencing of genes may     take place. This is mainly studies for  X chromosome inactivation.</li>
<li>DNA methylation in cancer cells is altered. The epigenetic     changes is altered in these cells compared to the normal cells. These DNA methylation causes the scilencing of tumor suppressor genes which may lead     to uncontrolled cell growth, immortality and immune to repairing mechanism     of DNA damage by hypermethylation of these promoters in CpG islands. In stochastic     methylation was differing in cancer cells, large hypervariable regions     showed difference in gene expression involving tumor associated genes     which where the advantageous for tumor cells in their cellular mechanism. Also     hypomethylation caused the alteration in cancer cells leading to chromatin alterations.</li>
<li>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype) and was first     identified in colorectal cancer. CIMP is associated with diverse     clinicopathological characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability and genetic mutation in the <em>BRAF</em> gene.     CIMP can also be found in other tumor entities as breast cancer, In genetic     mutation, tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation has     proven useful for tumor classification of different tumor types. These     defined alterations are currently evaluated for their use as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapy response for different     cancers.</li>
<li>Methylation in repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity. Silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and also mutation     of repeats to prevent transposition may occur. So silencing of repeats     avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Methylation of  repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. </li>
