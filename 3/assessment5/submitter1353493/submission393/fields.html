    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are generally unmethylated. In this case the gene is expressed since the promoter is active. If the gene were a tumor suppressor gene this is exactly what we would want.</p>
<p>In many cancers, gene promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated. This will result in transcriptional silencing of the gene. If the gene that is silenced is a tumor suppressor gene that would be OK<strong> if</strong> the other copy of the allele is expressed. However, if there is a "double-hit" (i.e., both copies are affected) then the tumor can manifest.</p>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">one copy: normal; the 2nd copy: normal ==&gt; no cancer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">one copy: normal; the 2nd copy: silenced epigenetically ==&gt; no cancer</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">one copy: silenced epigenetically; the 2nd copy: inherited mutation ==&gt; cancer [Two hits] This is a likely scenario.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">one copy: silenced epigenetically; the 2nd copy: </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">silenced epigenetically</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> ==&gt; cancer [Two hits] This is also a likely scenario.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> </span></li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>The epimutations have a selective advantage due to (a) these cells are less likely to die, (b) the epimutations are inherited in duplicated daughter cells thus causing high likelyhood in scenarios 4 and 6 above. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In a normal cell, there are lots of repeats intergenic regions that span all chromosomes and it would be possible to find large chunks of DNA in two different chromosomes that are identical due to these repeats. This similarity could result in illegitimate recombinations. This is avoided by hypermethylation of CpGs in these repeats which chromatinizes these parts of the chromosome. This dense packaging will prevent recombination in these repeats.</span></p>
<p>In cancer, these repeats tend to become hypomethylated. Therefore, illegitimate recombination between chromosomes can occur. The repeats can also jump around in the genome and transpose and disrupt neighboring coding genes. The net result of hypomethylation of repeats is genomic instability.</p>
<p>In humans, mutations in Dnmt3B (a de novo methyl transferase) result in immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, and facial anomalies syndrome (ICF).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><strong>Drug class:</strong> Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor drug class and therefore is a hypomethylating agent.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia AML).  </span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Impact on DNA Methylation:</strong> When a cell is ready to replicate DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 binds to the DNA. The drug Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT1 and prevents methyl trasferase release. DNMT1 is a maintenance methyltransferase (as opposed to de novo) and acts only on replicating somatic cells. Inhibition of methyltransferase reduces the likelihood of methylation of CpG islands. Decitabine therefore results in unmethylated replicated cells.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Impact on Tumors</strong>: A possible effect of Decitabine may be due to dependance of MDS/AML on CpG island hypermethylation surrounding tumor suppressor genes. If these CpG islands are unmethylated, the tumor suppressor genes could be activated which then detect the malignant nature of the cell and kill the cell. Replication of cancer cells is rapid and therefore the drug affects them much more than the normal cells.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/lgf2 cluster region in chromosome 11 has the following subregions.  </p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">---Igf2---ICR1---H19---Enhancers---  </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In a normal cell: </span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">in the paternal copy of this cluster, ICR1 and H19 alleles are both methylated; ---Igf2---ICR1(me)---H19(me)---Enhancers---. The enhancers can then act on<strong> Igf2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2) gene which therefore is expressed</strong>.   </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">in the maternal copy of this cluster- CTCFbinding insulates the ICR1. ---Igf2---ICR1(CTCF)---H19---Enhancers---. Enhancers are blocked by CTCF and cannot access Igf2 gene but will access H19 gene. As a result, <strong>maternal Igf2 allele is silenced</strong> and maternal H19 gene is expressed.</span></li>
</ul><p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;"><span class="geneSymbol">H19</span><span> gene restrains growth, and  </span><span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span><span> gene promotes growth.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In Wilm's tumor (cancer of muscle tissue), maternal ICR allele is also methylated just as paternal ICR1. Disruption here is methylation of ICR1 in maternal allele.. There is no CTCF binding to maternal ICR as in a normal cell. As a result, Igf2 gets expressed in both maternal and paternal alleles this providing double dosage of lgf2 and no H19 at all. This loss of imprinting of this cluster occurs very early in development and causes childhood kidney tumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;"><span>An increased amount of Igl2 may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks on somatic cells are preserved in the daughter cells upon replication. Therefore, it is likely that once an epigenetic drug is used to alter the epigenome, the normal epigenetic machinery in a human cell can continue to maintain the altered epigenome even after the drug treatment is halted. The drug usage is required only as long as it takes to cause sufficient change in the epigenome for treatment of the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive period</strong> refers to the period when epigentic reprogramming which involves erasure and remodeling of epigenetic marks takes place.</p>
<p>The sensitive period includes <strong>early embryonic development</strong> and gametogenesis (<strong>primordial germ cell development</strong>).</p>
<p>In early embryonic development there are very few cells that are not yet differentiated into variious tissue cell types. If drug treatment is done during this period, epigenetic alterations would impact stem cells and spread to all cell types when the cells differentiate. This would be bad since the same epigenetic changes are not required in all cell types and may have extremely deletrious effects in some cell types. Furthermore, in early development, since there are only few cells, the magnitude of epigenetic alterations by the drug would be colossal and irrevrsible even with low dosage. The embryo may not be able to withstand the toxicity of the drug may </p></div>
