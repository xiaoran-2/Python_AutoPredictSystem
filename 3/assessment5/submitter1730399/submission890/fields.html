    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA_methylation alters gene expression in cells as cells divide and differantiate from embryonic stem cells tospecific tissue. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional. DNA methylation is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development.</li>
<li><span><span><span>hypermethylation and hypomethylation of CpG islands compared to normal tissue is associated with a large number of tumers.<span> The genomes of cancer cells are shown to be hypomethylated overall when compared to normal cells, Exception: hypermethylation at genes involved in cell cycle regulation, tumor cell invasion, </span><span class="ontologyTermLink">DNA repair</span><span>, tumor suppressorion and others genes in which silencing propagates </span><span class="glossaryTermLink">metastasis</span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li>Disturption of DNA methylation at CpG islands may lead to sillencing of certain genes that's required for normal growth for exmaple. Or overexpression of certain genes lead to overproduction of certain hormone. <span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Errors in methylation could give rise to  various diseases such as cancer, lupus, muscular dystrophy, and a range of </span><span class="glossaryTermLink" style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">birth defects</span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;"> that appear to be caused by defective </span><span class="glossaryTermLink" style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">imprinting </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">mechanisms.</span></li>
<li>DNA_methylation at Intergenic regions helps to Maintain genomic integrity ( e.g Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability)<br />DNA_methylation at Repetative elements helps to Maintain genomic integrity through silencing of repeats and prevention of  transposition,so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination.</li>
<li>
<p>repeats/ intergenic intervals are hypomethylation in cancer lead to Genomic Instability:<br />- Illegitimate recombination between repeats       - Activation of repeats and transposition<br />- Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles)</p>
</li>
<li>repeats/ intergenic intervals are hypomethylation contribute to disease through several mechanisms. Activation of transposition for example may cause incativation of several genes (through mutaion) required for certain hormone production leading to its deficiency causing a disease state.  </li>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

<p>The rationale behind demethylation therapies is the ability of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to revert hypermethylation induced gene silencing. Hypermethylation-induced gene silencing of tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes plays a fundamental role in human tumorigenesis. The reversion of these epigenetic mutations can therefore restore proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>Experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These experience-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes</span></li>
