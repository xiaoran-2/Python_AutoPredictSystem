    <h1>Submission 1258 from Anon (session_user_id: 427c947f643ae5182dd6a43f9ca341321af1feec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplasitc syndrome.</p>
<p>It inhibits DNA methylation, which in turn will allow the tumor suppressor genes to remain active, allowing the cell to fight the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once the parent cell loses its methylation pattern, it gets passed to the next generation of cells. Once the first daughter cells are lacking the pattern, future generations of cells will also lose the methylation pattern.</p>
<p>A sensitive period, is a time at which the developing cell is highly susceptible to epigentic changes. Sensitive periods of development include, post fertilization when the epigenetic markers are erased and any time where germ cells are differentiating into specific cells, as these times are extra sensitive to environmental changes that affect the epigenome.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods is inadvisable as it can have an unwanted affect as the drug can overshoot its target, affecting a wider area of the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands are generally demethylated in the mammalian genome. In a cancerous cell the CpG islands are hypermethylated. This methylation pattern silences tumor suppressor genes allowing cancer to proliferate.</span></p>
<p><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancerous cells they can become demethylated, turning on a function that is detrimental to the cell.  </span></p>
<p><span>Repetitive elements are methylated. Demethylation of the repetitive elements in cancer allows for mobility of these elements. They can now copy and insert themselves throughout the genome disrupting normal gene function. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele methylation of the ICR block the binding of CTCF on the DNA molecule. This allows the H19 locus to be methylated and allows the enhancers to express the Igf2 gene. </p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated allowing CTCF to bind to the DNA molecule. This blocks the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene, silencing it. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the ICR is hypermethylated in the maternal allele, causing overexpression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In cells that have disrupted imprinting, the expression of Igf2 is twice the normal expression, while there is no expression of H19</p></div>
