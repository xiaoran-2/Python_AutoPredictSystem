    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Broadly speaking, in cancer occurs locus-specific DNA methylation (specially at sub-sets of promoter CpG islands and island shores of tumor suppressor genes) accompanied by Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Normally, the degree of methylation of the promoter region of genes is inversely correlated with the level of expression of such genes. However, most CpG islands in the promoter regions are demethylated. On the other hand, high degrees of methylation, in the intergenic regions, specially at repetitive elements, is highly disseminated throughout the genome. Gene body methylation is also present in highly expressed genes and has a signaling role.</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG islands in cancer tends to silence tumor suppressor genes, which control the progression of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. This loss of expression may act as a hit in the Knudson hypothesis. Silencing of both copies of a tumor suppressor gene is enough for a cell to enter a tumorigenesis process.</p>
<p>In contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are subjected to hypomethylation, which results in an increased instability of the genome, and ultimately, in an accumulation of further mutations. Examples of the mechanisms responsible for the instability when the methylation is lost are: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is a common feature in cancer, since many of the genes that are normally expressed in a monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific manner are involved in regulating growth. One molecular mechanism that is usually involved is changes in the methylation pattern of the Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs).</p>
<p>One example of imprinting disruption in cancer is the overexpression of the <em>Igf2</em> gene.</p>
<p>Normally, this gene is only expressed from the paternal allele, whereas the maternal allele is silenced. This monoallelic expression is due to the methylation of the paternal ICR of the <em>Igf2/H19</em> locus, which inhibits the binding of CTCF, that insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers and would annul its expression. On the other hand, the maternal allele remains unmethylated, thus allowing the binding of CTCF, the silencing of <em>Igf2</em> and the expression of <em>H19</em>.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is an hypermethylation of the ICR of the <em>Igf2/H19 </em>cluster on the maternal allele as well, which causes the loss of imprinting and leads to overexpression  of the <em>Igf2</em> gene, which is growth promoting and can contribute to the development of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat cancer that belongs to the family of DNA-demethylating agents, in particular, to the DNMT inhibitors.</p>
<p>These agents are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA  preventing the clonal manteinance of tumor-methylation marks.</p>
<p>Because of its <em>modus operandi</em>, it affects cells that are actively replicating.</p>
<p>As it has a demethylating effect, it is most effective in the treatment of tumors that present heavy CpG island methylation, such as myelodysplastic syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because these epigenetics marks meet the definition and, in consequence, are mitotically heritable and clonally maintained.</p>
<p>Since drugs that affect DNA methylation do not target exclusively the tumor cells, treating patients during sensitive periods in which epigenetic marks are cleared and reset  would be inadvisable, since it could result in an aberrant establishment of these marks.</p>
<p>The most sensitive periods in epigenetic reprogramming are the pre-implantation period and early development of the embryo, and the primordial germ cell development. Since the latter still occurs in young patients, the secondary effects should be taken into account in relation with drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery, in particular, DNA methylation.</p></div>
