    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at CpG groups and almost always silences the gene in which it occurs. Some CpG groups are located within CpG islands, regions of DNA with a higher concentration of CG sequences than other parts of the genome, and most of these are not methylated in normal cells. When they are methylated it is usually only at certain stages of development or in specific types of cells. DNA methylation also occurs at the CpG islands in the inactive X chromosome, silencing those genes and ensuring the mitotic heritability of the X inactivation.</p>
<p>Overall the genome is less highly methylated in cancer cells. There is more DNA methylation, however, at CpG islands. Both of these trends are amplified as the cancer progresses. Most CpG islands are found in gene promoters, many are found in the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes. When these CpG islands become methylated, the tumor-suppressor genes are silenced.</p>
<p>In normal cells CpGs are usually methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA contributes to genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombinations, which could lead to the deletion, insertion, translocation, or duplication of parts of the chromosomes.  In cancer cells these repeats regions are hypomethylated. When they are unmethylated, they are free to recombine with non-homologous chromosomes that contain a matching repetitive DNA element. DNA methylation in intergenic regions silences cryptic promoters and strong promoters that could interfere with the transcription of adjacent genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike methylation in promoters, methylation in the ICRs (Imprint Control Regions) does not necessarily lead to gene silencing. The gene for Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) is paternally imprinted. In the paternal chromosome, the ICR for Igf2 is methylated, preventing the insulator protein, CTCF, from binding to the ICR.  This allows the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 gene so that it is expressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal chromosome, the ICR is not methylated and Igf2 is not expressed. The unmethylated ICR is covered by an insulator protein, CTCF, that blocks the enhancers from Igf2</p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can be disrupted by a mutation or deletion, both chromosome copies coming from a single parent, or loss of imprinting. When this imprinting is disrupted on the maternal chromosome, Wilm’s tumor results.</p>
<p>Cancer results from activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors. When imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted such that the maternal ICR is methylated, Igf2, which promotes growth, is expressed from both alleles and Kcnq1ot, which restricts growth, is not expressed at all. Since Igf2 promotes growth, it is considered an oncogene.  Since Kcnq1ot restricts growth, it is considered a tumor suppressor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that inhibits an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  It is a nucleoside analog that becomes incorporated into the DNA. When the DNA is replicated, DNA methyltransferase becomes irreversibly bound to the DNA, preventing methylation in the replicated DNA. Decitabine has been found effective in myelodysplastic syndromes. Hypermethylation in CpG islands in myelodysplastic syndromes is associated with a poor prognosis, so inhibiting methylation in the CpG islands may suppress the tumor.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When the DNA methylation of a cell’s genome is altered, this change is passed mitotically to the daughter cells. Sensitive periods are those stages of development when environmental influences have the greatest effect on epigenetic regulation. This is because the epigenome is becoming remodeled by the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks during these stages. The sensitive periods of development include primordial germ cell development, early embryonic development, and even childhood. During the pre-implantation stage of early development epigenetic marks are removed, after implantation epigenetic marks are laid down in a lineage-specific way. There are also periods when certain organs are more sensitive to environmental influences because they are undergoing tissue-specific differentiation. Drugs that target cell epigenetics affect not just cancer cells, but all the cells in the body. If a patient is given a drug that inhibits DNA methylation at a time when germ cells are developing, this may prevent appropriate genetic marks from being laid down in those germ cells. This change could affect the phenotype not only the offspring, but in some cases even in the grandchildren.</p>
