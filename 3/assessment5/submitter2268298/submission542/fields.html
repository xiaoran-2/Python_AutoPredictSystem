    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands in promoter regions are hyomethylated but in Cancer they become hypermethylated which leads to silencing of the underlying gene. There is a general hall mark of cancer where there is a genome wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation. This may lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes and explain part of the multiple hit hypothesis of Knudson. Besides deregulation of tissue specific genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. This methylation is mitotically heritable, differs by cell type and this epimutation is thought to be reversible.</p>
<p>Examples of CGI methylation genes in cancer is RB in Retinoblastoma and MLH1 in colorectal cancer thats why they can be used as biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis and may give information about type of treatment needed.</p>
<p>In intergenic and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated where it plays a role in genomic stability and decrease transcriptional noise. But it has been shown that a decrease in methylation occurs in cancer. In case of intergenic elements this hypomethylation causes genetic instabiliy leading to reciprocal transolcations sometimes while in repeptitive elements might lead to activation where they make a copy of themselves and transpose. other theories imply activation of cryptic promoters.This is evident in cases of DNMT3B in ICF in humans and Dnmt1 deletion in the mouse model.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cases of disruption of DNA methylation patterns at ICRs in cases of cancer this leads to loss of imprinting and overexpressing of a growth promoting factor or under expressing of a growth restricting factor.</p>
<p>Normally in the maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster CTCF lies near an insulator protein which insulates IGF2 from downstream enhancers, while in paternal allele DNA methylation of ICR blocks this CTCF binding and methylation spreads to H19 promoter silencing it where enhancers now have access to IGF2 and it's activated </p>
<p>As an example hypermethylation at ICR may lead to over expression of IGF2 found in Wilm´s tumour and it was also notable that this loss of imprinting is an early even preneoplastic event. In that case hypermathylation of both alleles will lead to biallelic expression of IGF2 which is an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine sold as Dacogen is a demethylating agent used in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes progressing to AML.It was found that at much lower doses than previousely used they have less side effects and toxicity and better demthylation. This drug works on DNMT using small molecular inhibitors/nucleoside analogues binding DNMT irreversibly so they are replication dependant. They work on hematological tumours possibly because of hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes there but actual mechanism is unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and the epigenetic changes they cause are known to be mitotically heritable and are passed from daughter to grand-daughter cells so they are shown to have an ability to stop cancer without killing the cell. Sensitive periods that may affect such permanent changes are in primordial germ cell stage or early emberyonic development and where those methylation marks are removed. It is not advisable treating young patients for fear of affecting germ cells irreversibly .</p></div>
