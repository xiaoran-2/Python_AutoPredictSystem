    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of an imprinting control region (ICR) may contribute to cancer. One example is the disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster due to ICR hypermethylation, which contributes to Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>The imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is regulated by DNA methylation of the ICR, located between the genes Igf2 and H19. In paternal allele, the ICR is methylated leading to inhibition of H19 gene expression (as DNA methylation spreads through its promoter region) and inhibition of CTCF (an insulator) binding to the ICR leading the downstream enhancers to stimulate the expression of Igf2. So in paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed and H19 is silenced. By the other hand, the absence of methylation of ICR in maternal allele leads to H19 expression (the promoter region is unmethylated) and Igf2 silencing (due to CTCF binding to ICR, which insulate the access of enhancers to Igf2).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted because maternal allele is methylated in a similar fashion to the paternal allele, so the ICR is hypermethylated. This DNA hypermethylation leads to biallelic expression and overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene that contributes to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be caused by locus specific DNA hypermethylation (in CpG islands of tumour supressor genes and in imprinting control regions - ICRs - of imprinted genes) or by genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (in CpG island-poor genes, as oncogenes, and in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and ICRs of imprinted genes).</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands of genes is to promote gene inactivation or silencing. It occurs because DNA methylation blocks the binding of the transcription machinery and recruits inhibitory proteins that promote chromatin condensation, both features associated with gene silencing. In cancer, the DNA methylation of CpG islands may be disrupted due to locus specific hypermethylation in CpG islands of tumour supressor genes. Normally, these CpG islands are hypomethylated and tumour supressor genes are active. However, in cancer this disruption of  DNA methylation, leading to DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, results in inactivation of tumour supressor genes that are involved in inhibition of tumorigenesis, which leads to the development of cancer.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to promote chromatin stability, because it prevents chromosomal deletions, insertions and translocations, and also inhibits transposable elements to be random inserted in the genome. In cancer, the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is reduced (DNA hypomethylation), which leads to chromosomal instability and also in silencing or activation of genes due to the incorporation of transposable elements. Thus, DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions results in chromosome instability and aberrations, which are main features of cancer. Also, the insertion of transposable elements in the genome may result in cancer once it may activate oncogenes or silence tumour supressor genes located in the neighboring region where these elements were transposed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class of DNA-demethylating agents. It is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Decitabine results in DNA demethylation, which means that it reduces the DNA methylation or promotes hypomethylation throughout DNA replication and cell divisions.</p>
<p>As Decitabine promotes DNA demethylation, it may be used as an anti-tumour agent in cases where DNA hypermethylation is the cause of cancer. Then the use of Decitabine depends on the epigenetic context of cancer. For example, Decitabine may be used to promote demethylation and consequently gene reactivation in cases of cancer associated with locus specific DNA hypermethylation and silecing of tumour supressor genes. In this situation, Decitabine will demethylate locus specific CpG islands in cells under division (for example, in cancer cells) leading to reactivation of tumour supressor genes, which in turn will inhibit tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications, which include DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable. So epigenetic modifications induced in one cell will persist on its daughter and granddaughter cells (in the future generations of cells).</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in development where the epigenetic marks are being extensively established or remodeled. Then this period is more critical to the occurrence of epigenetic errors due to external influence or injury. There are two sensitive periods of development in mammalian: the first period is during the preimplantation development (between fertilization and blastocyst development) and the second period is during primordial germ cell formation and gametogenesis.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would lead to genomic global epigenetic modifications (and not only modifications of genes that were disturbed due to disease) and also to epigenetic disturbance in germ cells, resulting, respectively, in inadvisable effects in the patient and maybe in the offspring of this individual.</p></div>
