    <h1>Submission 567 from Anon (session_user_id: 95284c5b45ee90bcab4f2596bfea10f0f5ba18ba)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Decitabine is a DNA demethylater, it inhibits DNA methyl transferase</li>
<li>It causes hypo methylation of DNA</li>
<li>It restores normal function of genes that control cellular differentiation and proliferation.</li>
</ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is long lasting within the cell and is mitotically inherited so all progeny will have the change inherited also. The sensitive periods are those when methylation is laid down, such as embyonic development or germ cell differentiation.</p>
<p>If people were treated during these times, the treatment would disrupt the normal methylation patterns required for development.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands will supress the involved gene. In cancer many of these normaly unmethylated islands will be hypermethylated. The hypermethylated CpG islands turn OFF tumor supressing genes, thus enabling unregulated growth and possibly cancer.</p>
<p>Normally intergenic and repetitive areas are hypermethylated. In cancer they become hypomethylated, allowing them to translocate more easily thus causing genomic instability. They may also effect transcription and turn on oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is a maternally imprinted gene, ie, it is methylated and turned off on the maternal allele and unmethylated and transcribed by the paternal allele. In wilms tumor Igf2 is expressed by both alleles and thus Igf2 is over expressed.</p>
<p>Igf2, insulin like growth factor2 gene is involved in growth, and thus if overproduced is implicated in embryonic solid organ tumors like wilms tumor. Also H19 is linked to Igf2 production such that when Igf2 transcription increases H19 transcription is decreased. Since H19 may be a tumor supressor, down regulation may contribute to oncogenesis.</p>
<p>Disruption of the Igf2 /H19 locus lalso lead to 'tissue growth' diseases like Beckworth Wiedeman syndrome, characterised by overgrowth.</p></div>
