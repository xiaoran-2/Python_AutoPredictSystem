    <div class="field-value"><p>It is found with all cancer DNA methylation is altered.  In normal cells, CpG islands or CGI's are unmethylated which are associated with over half of mammalian gene promoters.  While intergentic regions and repeative elements are methylated. This combination prevents the cell from reverting back to a stem cell state and also allowing the daughter cells to inherit the same expression.  But with cancers these CpG islands, not all the time but most of the time, which are locus specific, are hypermethlated.  In contrast, there is a genome wide hypomethylation.  This hypermethylation of the CpG islands cause transcriptional silencing that is passed to the daughter cells through cell division.  This hypermethylation of CpG islands are located at the promoter region of the tumor suppressor genes.  Furthemore DNA repair that would normal happen is surpressed leading to disease.  This also happens with programmed cell death where cell that normally would die are living and also with controlling cell cycle.   The intergenic regions and repetive elements being hypomethylated can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats.  <span>Normally recombination occurs between like chromosomes then are protected through methylation but as seen in some cancers these similarities in repeats can be recombined causing mutations.</span> These once stable regions prevented adnormalities as mentioned chromosome translocation or deletion and insertion of a chromosome.  Since these regions are not packed down in hectachromatin they can be active due to hypomethylation and jump around in the genome or activate their promoters.  The implications with cancer are that cell cycle machinery control cell proliferation.  Cancer is a disease of inappropriate cell division. This division complemented with a lose of signaling telling the cell when to die leads to disease.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 are imprinted gene which is to say it is a parent of orgin gene.  In normal cells the maternal H19 are expressed and on the paternal side Igf2 is expressed.  The imprinted control region between the H19 and Igf2 of the paternal chromosome is methylated therefore is imprint.  This imprint blocks the insulator protein CTCF buffer from attaching allowing the enhancers to express Igf2.  In the maternal allele the CTCF buffer can bind to the unmethelated region blocking the enhancer's preferred route thus enhancing its second choice H19.  In the case of Wilm's tumor the maternal chromesone is reverted back to a paternal type.  The lose of the imprinted gene H19 is due to methylation of several sites upstream of the H19 promoter. Since the CTCF is now blocked by the methyl group, Igf2 is turned on in the maternal chromosome just like in the paternal chromosome.  Now there is an over expression Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene it promotes cell growth suggesting h19 to have tumor suppressor like effect. So loss of the imprinted gene H19 and over expression of Igf2 contibutes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as a demethylating agent that act on a small molecule inhibiter.   This drug targets the epigenitic machinery DNMT1 (DNA methyl transferase 1).  Normally DNMT1  is a maintenance hemimethylated dna substrate, methylates one strand of the DNA after cells divide.  In some cancers like glimoas over expression of DNMT1 results in methylation of tumor suppressor gene.  When Decitabine is up taken into DNA through replication it<span> is bound at the active site for DNMT1. O</span>nce incorperated this irrevesably inhibits the DNA methyltransferase thus blocking this epigenic machinery DMNT1 from  methylating this gene in the daughter cells. Cancer cell replicate more than normall cells.  So If we can reduce the DNA methylation of the hypermethylated tumor suppressor gene with Decitabine then we can supress tumorigenesis. Very low dosage of DMNT1 inhibitors  works well at killing tumor cells but high levels are toxic.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes with methylation is mitodically inheritable.  Drugs that treat for epigenetic   expressions could be passed on</span>to daughter cells and granddaughter cells. This would allow for a lasting affect even after the drug has been stopped.  It has been observed in patients that have been treated with some epigenetic therapy there was a lasting effect that was thought to make chemotherapy more susceptible . Epigenitic control is crucial for every cell type.  In most cases as an adult our genes are very stable.  When epigenetic drug therapies are applied there is little effect on these well established and protected genes.   Cancer cell which are very dependent on there epigenitic changes,  multiply more rapidly therefore more drug is around these genes making it easrier to alter. To preserve totipotency in primordial germ cell development and early development, DNA is demethylated.  This allows for the epigenetic marks to be reprogrammed.    These two sensitive periods, primordial germ  cells and earily development, are vulnerable to epigenetic changes and its not advisable to treat patients with drugs that disrupt epigenic machinery.  With women who are pregnant this could be lethal to the fetus.  Changes in the normal epigenetic germ cells development could have numerous transgeneration side effect.</p></div>
