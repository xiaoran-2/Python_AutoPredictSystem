    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in 60% percent of gene promotors and they are usually protected from methylation. Methylation of CpG islands leads to gene silencing, and when they are normally methylated they keep their methylation status. In cancer they tend to be hypermethylated, which leads to silencing of genes that regulate cell growth (tumor suppressor genes). These genes regulate cell division, DNA repair and cell apoptosis, and their silencing greatly contributes to development of cancer. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Purpose of their DNA methylation is to preserve genomic integrity, that is, to prevent illegitimate recombinations, translocations, deletions or insertions. In cancer we find genome wide DNA hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. It is the earliest epigenetic abnormalitiy found, it progresses with time and occurs in all tumor types. The consequent genome instability leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters which disrupt neighbouring genes. This results in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations which can contribute to cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, cancer methylome is characterized by genome wide hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster on the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents CTCF from insulating the region and allows enhancers to act on Igf2 gene, allowing its expression. On the maternal allele ICR is not methlylated, CTCF insulates it and thus preventing enhancers to act on Igf2 gene, which than instead act on H19, which is expressed. When loss of imprinting occurs, that is, when the imprint control region is methylated on the maternal allele too, the result is Wilm's tumor, a child's kidney tumor. Due to loss of imprinting, CTCF no longer insulates ICR on the maternal allele, which results with expression of Igf2 on both alleles, maternal and paternal. Now we have a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting, and therefore promotes the growth of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors), which means it is a nucleoside analogue. It is incorporated in DNA and then irreversibly bound to DNA methyltransferase. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase causes passive demethylation of DNA. The exact mechanism by which Decitabine acts is still unclear, but it is probably due to demethylation of CpG islands that tend to be hypermethylated in cancer that it has an anti-tumour effect, especially in myeloid dysplastic sindrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If we inhibit a DNA methyltransferase, we will cause passive demethylation, which will be maintained after the cell completely looses a methylation mark (that is, on both DNA strands), which is a permanent effect on the epigenome. There are periods of development when cells go through extensive epigenetic reprogramming, and during which epigenetic disruptions can have long term effects on health. Those sensitive periods are early embryonic development and germ cell development. Therefore, treating children and pregnant women with drugs that target epigenetic machinery could have a permanent detrimental effect on their fertility and health of their offspring because the drugs would most likely disrupt epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in germ cells and embryonic development.</p>
