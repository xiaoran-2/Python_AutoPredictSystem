    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the features of cancer. Alteration in DNA methylation can be found both as hypermethylation and as hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation at CpG islands functions as a regulator of gene expression. Its main function is, by regulating gene expression, to determine the phenotype each cell lineage would adopt during early development. In the organism, all cells have the same DNA, but not all of them express the same genes. This cell-specific (or tissue-specific) gene expression is regulated, mostly, by differential DNA methylation in specific genes.  A proper lay down of methylation marks during reprogramming periods is essential to ensure that each cell lineage would acquire its specific phenotype. In general, a high rate of CpG island methylation (hypermethylation) is related to a reduced expression whereas a low rate of methylation (hypomethylation) is related to enhanced gene expression. It has been shown that a common feature of cancers is that they show altered DNA methylation at CpG islands. On the one hand, hypermethylation at CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes and ICRs (imprint control regions) and, on the other hand, genome-wide hypomethylation (affecting repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs). Disruption of DNA methylation in CpG islands contributes to disease by promoting tumour growth (silencing of tumour suppressor genes), genomic instability (hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats) and altered gene expression.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic stability and to prevent transposition or recombination. In normal cells, these DNA regions are usually methylated. However, in cancer cells it has been shown a genome-wide hypomethylation affecting intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This causes genomic instability and, therefore, mutations and chromosomal rearrangements occur leading to disease</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Loss of DNA methylation at ICRs is common in cancer.</p>
<p>Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is a protein hormone which has growth-regulating, insulin-like and mitogenic activities. Its expression is regulated by the H19/Igf2 cluster. This cluster contains the <em>Igf2</em> gene, an ICR which is a binding site for the protein CTCF, the <em>H19</em> promoter and enhancers of gene expression. The regulation of this cluster is different in maternal and paternal alleles.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and CTCF binding is prevented. As a consequence, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it. In this situation, enhancers can access <em>Igf2</em> and activate its expression. On the other hand, in the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, CTCF binds the ICR, <em>H19 </em>expression occurs and enhancers cannot promote <em>Igf2</em> expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, a hypermethylation of ICR is shown. The maternal allele presents ICR methylation (as the paternal does) and, therefore, an <em>Igf2 </em>overexpression occurs. As Igf2 is a growth factor, its overexpression leads to enhanced growth and disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of epigenetic inhibitors that inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTi). This means that it is a demethylating drug and, thus, reduces DNA methylation.</p>
<p>One of the most important and common features of different types of cancer is that they show hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes at CpG islands and/or ICRs (imprint control regions). In such a case, tumor suppressor genes are not expressed or expressed at a lower extent and, therefore, tumorigenesis is enhanced. In the case of methylation of ICRs, these alterations could lead to a loss of expression of growth restricting genes and, thus, an uncontrolled tumour growth.</p>
<p>In this context, Decitabine would have an anti-tumour affect by reducing hypermethylation in tumour suppressor genes, allowing their expression and limiting tumour growth. However, as a drug subjected to systemic administration, it would affect every single cell in the organism, not only those in the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and, therefore, changes in the epigenome caused by an epigenetic drug could be maintained during cell generations, from daughter to granddaughter, until they are completely removed. This could explain how an epigenetic drug may have affect after treatment removal.</p>
<p>In the present context, a sensitive period is a lapse of time in which the DNA of an organism can be epigenetically altered. There are two sensitive periods during development in which epigenetic reprogramming occurs: during early development (in the pre-implantation period) and during primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>The use of epigenetic drugs during any of these sensitive periods should be avoided because any epigenetic change caused by them would be established as a “normal” epigenetic modification and would affect every single cell in the whole organism.</p></div>
