    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in promoter regions (5' regulatory regions) of genes. In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated and this hypomethylation allows gene expression. In a cancer cell, gene promoter CpG islands are abnormally hypermethylated, which results in transcriptional silencing. In cancer, hypermethylated CpG islands are generally found in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes that are genes that prevent the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Hypermethylation leads to the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, which will give a competitive advantage to the cell bearing the epimutation. This cell may divide more rapidly or be more resistant to cell death, which means that over a period of time, this cell will be selected over normal cells. However, it is believed that several epimutations/genetic mutations are required for cancer to develop.  </p>
<p>It is thought that the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is 1) to silence cryptic transcription start sites and therefore prevent non-specific transcription and 2) to maintain genomic integrity. DNA methylation in repetitive elements is also involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity in three different ways: 1) it silences the repeats to prevent transposition, 2) it silences the repeats to avoid transcriptional interference (i.e. activation of neighbouring genes), and 3) it prevents illegitimate recombination by maintaining the repeats heterochromatinised. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and this hypomethylation increases with tumorigenicity. Abnormal hypomethylation found in cancer cells leads to genomic instability resulting from 1) illegitimate recombinations between repeats (due to their euchomatinisation) leading to abnormal karyotype, including deletions, insertions...,  2) activation of repeats, which can then make a copy of themselves and transpose in other genomic regions (potentially disrupting the coding sequence of critical genes), 3) abnormal activation of genes neighbouring either repeats or intergenic regions (especially oncogenes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. Hence the transcriptional repressor CTCF cannot bind the ICR, enhancers interact with paternal Igf2 promoter elements and Igf2 is transcribed/expressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and therefore, CTCF binds to the ICR insulator elements, preventing the interaction between enhancers and the Igf2 promoter. Those enhancers act instead on  H19. As a result, H19 is expressed while Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, there is a loss of imprinting at the ICR region. There is hypermethylation on the ICR of the maternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to this hypermethylated ICR and Igf2 is expressed on the maternal allele. Hence there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Igf2 promotes cell growth. In the case of a loss of Igf2 imprinting, the resulting excess in Igf2 protein leads to excessive cell growth leading to a particular tumor type, named Wilm's tumor, which occurs in children's kidneys.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into DNA during normal DNA synthesis and binds irreversibly to DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) when DNMT1 comes to copy methylation marks to the DNA daughter strand during cell replication. Hence Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNMT1 and the use of Decitabine leads to hypomethylation/demethylation of DNA. One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands, which inactivates tumour suppressor genes. Hypermethylation requires the continuous activity of DNMT1 to maintain abnormal hypermethylation marks through cell divisions. By inhibiting DNMT1, Decitabine prevents the maintenance of hypermethylation epimutations. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they take up more Decitabine and are therefore more affected than normal cells, which main explain why Decitabine does not appear to have detrimental effects on normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has long lasting effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation marks are heritable. During cell division, DNMT1 copies DNA methylation to daughter DNA strands. If DNA is demethylated by drugs such as Decitabine, the resulting hypomethylation will be passed on to daughter cells. There are periods of development when the use of drugs altering epigenetic marks should be avoided. Those sensitive periods of development are periods during which epigenetic marks are reprogrammed after having been cleared. There are two such periods during development: the first is after implantation of the embryo, at the blastocyst stage, and the second is during primordial germ cell development. The use of epigenetic drugs in pregnant women or children is not advisable as these drugs are used throughout the system, meaning that every single cell has the potential to be affected by these drugs. These drugs could have desastrous effects on genetic reprogramming that occurs in primordial germ cells in children or during post-implantation embryonic development.</p></div>
