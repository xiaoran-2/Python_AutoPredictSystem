    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found in gene promoters. When CpG islands are highly methylated, transcription factors cannot bind to DNA and the corresponding gene cannot be expressed, so heavy methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing.</p>
<p>Some genes have a tumor supression function as they control processes such as cell division and cell death. If CpG islands in the promoters of such genes suffer heavy methylation, these genes are not expressed and cells may acquire immortality and develop a high rate of division, becoming cancer cells. As the methylation of CpG islands is mytotically heritable, the number of cancer cells grows fast, leading to the formation of tumors.</p>
<p>On other side, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually highly methylated. The function of this methylation is maintaining genomic stability as it prevents illegitimate recombination that may cause translocations, transpositions, delections and other genetic mistakes leading to abnormal genomes.</p>
<p>When they are hypomethylated, these DNA intergenic regions become euchromatine, and are thus open to undesired gene activation, DNA recombination and genomic instability that may lead to mutations that finally result in cancer.</p>
<p>So, as we have seen, hypermethylation of tumor supressors and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, may unleash a chain of processes leading to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A lot of imprinted genes have a role in controlling cell growth. Altering this imprinting may promote considerable changes in this control, leading to uncontroled cell growth and the formation of tumors.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a DNA region whose action is controlled by imprintment. When this cluster is unmethylated (as is the case of the maternal allele), an insulator protein, the CTCF binds to the promoter and prevents the enhancers to make their primary role of expressing Igf2. This enhancers are thus free to enhance H19 expression, which is their secondary role. On the other side, when this cluster is methylated (as is the case of the paternal allele), the CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers are thus free to enhance the expression of Igf2 (their primary role).</p>
<p>When the imprinting is disrupted, the maternal allele becomes methylated and the expression of Igf2 is doubled as CTCF cannot bind. As Igf2 is a growth promoter, the uncontrolled growth of cells is far more likely, leading to the appearance of Wilm's tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As the article states, Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, so its use should lead to a reduction in DNA methylation.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the first question, hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes plays an important role in several types of cancers. The use of Decitabine, as a demethylating agent, may reduce this hypermethylation to normal levels of methylation, so tumor supressor genes may be normally expressed. This expression of tumor supressor genes should restore control of normal growth and death of cells, making the appearance of tumors a far less likely event.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome regulates the expression and silencing of genes. An alteration in DNA methylation may lead to important changes in DNA structure, expressing genes that were formerly silenced and viceversa, so the epigenome is seriously affected.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in which the epigenome is being reprogrammed, older epigenetic marks being removed and newer ones being laid down all over the genome. The most important sensitive periods are the primordial germ cell development to the production of eggs and sperms and the early embryonic development (pre and early post implantation). It looks there are other, less sensitive, periods of epigenetic reprogramming for particular organs.</p>
<p>In this sensitive periods there's a high sensibility to environmental conditions so treating patients with drugs altering DNA methylation during these periods may lead to serious abnormalities in their epigenome, leading to worse problems than those we are trying to fix. Out of these sensitive periods, the epigenome is far more stable and the risk of damaging it is far lower.</p>
