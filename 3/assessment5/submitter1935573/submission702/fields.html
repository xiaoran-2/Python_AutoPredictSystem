    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation means that instead of a normal C (cytosine) the DNA contains a methylated version of C (denoted by meC). DNA methylation is  a common form of epigenetic gene regulation, methylated DNA is in general associated with silencing: the methylated part of the DNA is in the form of a heterochromatine, a condensed form of DNA. </p>
<p>In a normal cell, the methylation of the CpG islands around the promoter of a gene determines the activity of the gene: if the CpG islands are non-methylated then the gene is active, otherwise (when the CpG islands are  methylated) the gene is inactive. (Methylation (among other factors) transforms euchromatine into heterochromatine.) </p>
<p>In a cancer cell, the CpG islands of some tumor supressors genes (which should be active to suppress excessive cellular growth, so in a normal cell their CpG islands are un-methylated) become methylated. In this way tumor supressor genes cannot work, cells can grow on excessively and proliferate.    </p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated so this part of the DNA is in an inactive state. Since repetitive elements and intergenic regions are inactive, there are less translocations and transpositions, thus the genome is more stable. </p>
<p>In a cancer cell,  these repetitive elements and intergenic regions suffer hypomethylation. It means that more transpositions and translocations occur, which results in genome instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting means that one of the two copies of an allele is not working: only the paternal  or the maternal copy of the gene is active. In the first case the gene is maternally imprinted, in the latter case it is paternally imprinted. Imprinted genes are often found in clusters, the process of imprinting is regulated by the imprinting center (ICR) of the cluster. </p>
<p>On the 11th human chromosome there is a gene cluster containing the H19 lncRNA and the Igf2 gene.  Igf2 is an oncogene. </p>
<p>On the maternal  allele the ICR of this cluster is  not methylated  so a special insulator protein, called CTCF can bind to it. This protein insulates  the upstream Igf2 from the downstream enhancers: the enhancers cannot  activate Igf2, the Igf2 gene on the maternal allele is inactive.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR of the cluster is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to it thus nothing insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, Igf2 is activated by the enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilm tumor both allele of the ICR of the cluster is methylated (because of a hypermethylation on the maternal allele), thus both Igf2 allele are active resulting in overexpression of an oncogene causing cell proliferation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. A DNMTi inhibits the work of a  DNA methyltransferase enzimes which transfers methyl groups to the DNA. Thus using a DNMTi reduces the general methylation of the DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine works in the following way: while the cell is replicating and a DNMT enzyme binds to the DNA, the DNMTi irreversibily binds the DNMT enzyme.  With this binding the DNMT can no longer work, the general  methylation is reduced.  </p>
<p>Tumor-cells in general contain methylated i.e inactive tumor supressor genes, so  when the general methylation of the DNA decreases, the activation of these genes is no longer supressed.  </p>
<p>Tumor cells divide much more than normal cells so the effect of Decitabine is more sever for them than for the normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks, especially DNA methylation are mitotically inherited, so all the daughter cells will have the same epigenetic state. Thus an altered DNA methylation will last for a long time after the treatment. </p>
<p>This long-lasting epigenetic state can have some non-wanted consequences because in a treatment like this all the cells are concerned, that is the treatment alters the epigenetic state of all the cells of the body of the patient.  If these cells are in sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, it is advisable to avoid such a therapy. A sensitive period is for example the period of germ cell development and the period of early embryotic develepoment.</p>
<p>If the patients (i.e. young patients or pregnant women) are treated with such drug treatment during these sensitive periods then non-wanted long-lasting epigenetic modifications may occur in their germ-cell or in the cell of the growing emryo. This can cause several epigenetic driven deseases, infertility or  the death of the embryo.  </p>
