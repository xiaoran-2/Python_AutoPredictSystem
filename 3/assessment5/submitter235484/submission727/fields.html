    <div class="field-value"><p>                   </p>
<p>In mammalian somatic cells, approximately 80% of the CpG sites in DNA are methylated. However, the so called CpG islands, found in approx. 60% of promoters, are usually not methylated, an state that in many cases is associated with absence of methylated-driven expression suppression (this lack of methylation-driven suppression must not be understood as transcription activation, only as lack of one of many kinds of gene expression blockade).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, many of those CpG islands are methylated, meaning that the associated promoters, hence the genes, are silenced, resulting in the suppression or severe disruption of cell death, proliferation control, DNA repair or other cancer-sanitizing pathways in the cell. In the last years, it has been discovered that in some cancers, the areas around the CpG islands, called CpG island shores, are also hyper-methylated. It has been found that the pattern of hyper-methylation in CpG islands defines a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), that can be used to differentiate different types of cancer, with a clinical use in detection and diagnosis, treatment adaptation and prognosis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repetitive sequences in the DNA are usually methylated, even in intergenic (intron) regions, understood as a genome stabilization mechanisms. Non-methylated repetitive sequences can trigger undesired chromosome recombination (via pairing with similar repetitive sequences in another chromosome). Also, some sequences include very strong promoters (sometimes known as crypto promoters) that are activated when un-methylated, causing transposon replication and DNA migration (disrupting existing genes); modifying a nearby gene sequence (as transcription would start in a different place); and others. All this effects can be seen in cancer, where repetitive sequences are hypo-methylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting control for IGF2 and H19 genes is carried out by enhancer blocking. In the maternal allele, lack of methylation at one site recruits the CTCF protein, blocking access to IGF2 gene from nearby enhancers. As a result, the enhancers act over the H19 gene, that it is expressed, and IGF2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, however, we find methylation at the CTCF binding site and also at the H19 promoter. CTCF can not bind because of the methylation, and enhancers can activate IGF2 gene. H19 is methylated-silenced.</p>
<p>As a result, only the paternal allele IGF2 is expressed, and only the maternal allele H19 is expressed. A normal cell is then producing then long non-coding RNA determined by the mother allele, and IGF2 protein determined by the father allele.</p>
<p>If, because of an error in the epigenetic machinery, the maternal allele CTCF binding site is methylated, then that allele will be expressing IGF2, and not H19. These cells express double the amount of IGF2 (both maternal and paternal alleles), and no H19. Given that IGF2 is involved in growth control in early development, this methylation disruption can be one factor in the cell becoming cancerous. This imprinting disruption is found in Wilms tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the article, decitabine is described as a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that its action is through influencing the molecular machinery that works on adding DNA methylation or on conserving the DNA methylation after cell division. The drug would act by inhibiting new methylation and the re-methylation after cell division.</p>
<p>For those cancers with a mechanism associated with hyper-methylation, treated tumour cells would gradually lose that hyper-methylation, hopefully stopping cancerous behaviour. It is important to note that not every cancer would benefit and that, in principle, healthy cells would also see affected its DNA methylation mechanisms. However, as cancerous cell divide more often, the effect on them can be more quick and potent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once established, DNA methylation is conserved in somatic cells in a very stable way. Thus, cells with an epigenome modified through the use of a drug would probably keep that modification on, unless their conserving mechanism is altered. If the drug is safe and it has been safely administered, only cancerous cells would have undergone those modifications, with healthy cells left mostly unaffected.</p>
<p>The stability of DNA methylation means that the phases where methylation is established, the "sensitive periods", are very important, as any mark introduced during those periods would normally be conserved through the adult life. In mammals, the main sensitive period is in early embryo development, with the production of gametes also being sensitive (as the full epigenetic marks need to be imprinted from pluripotent, epigenetic stripped out germ cells). Studies have also demonstrated that the prenatal period and early childhood are also sensitive periods where some epigenetic marks can be deposited (e.g. studies on maternal care effect, mother diet, etc.)</p>
<p>Treating patients during those period with drugs that can modify the epigenome would mean increased risk of introducing epigenetic modifications that would be conserved for the rest of the life of the patient, with unknown, potentially severe, results.</p></div>
