    <h1>Submission 1844 from Anon (session_user_id: 9f06c5658e8237fe755e4a10b30472580bc7af65)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent. This drug is in the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), thus, it inhibits the action of methyltransferase enzymes which catalyze the transfer methyl groups to DNA. DNMT inhibitors work by irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA (they are nucleoside analogues).  The impact of Decitabine is therefore to decrease DNA methylation. Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect by inhibiting aberrant methylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressors. By inhibiting the methylation of the CpG islands of tumour suppressors, methylation will not be copied when the cell divides, and the CpG islands of the tumour suppressors will become hypomethylated and active. The tumour suppressors, once expressed, could lead to cell death or prevent the growth of the tumour.</p></div>

In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer involves the activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumour suppressors. This activation and inactivation can occur through genetic or epigenetic changes. One such example of an epigenetic change would be changes in the DNA methylation of CpG islands. The normal function of DNA methylation of CpG islands is that there is hypomethylation of genes that are expressed, such as tumour suppresors. In cancer, however, hypermethylation often occurs, silencing genes including tumour suppressors. Silenced tumour suppressors will be unable to function (such as causing the cell to undergo programmed cell death if the genome becomes damaged) which will contribute to cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to act as a silencer - there is usually hypermethylation. In cancer, however, there is genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This leads to genome instability, as there can be genome rearrangement through illegitimate recombination between repeats or activation of transposons which will jump around and insert themselves seemingly randomly within the genome. These random insertions can even lead to activation of cryptic promoters and/or disruption of neighbouring genes. Ways that disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease are the activation of cryptic promoters may be activated leading to increased expression of oncogenes, or disruption of tumour suppressors (through genome rearrangements, which could, for example, lead to a truncated and thus inactive tumour suppressor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the peroid of drug treatment. This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; when cells divide, the methylation pattern is copied and thus the two resulting cells from the mitotic cell division have the same methylation pattern.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. There are two sensitive periods during development when treating patients with such epigenetic altering drugs should be avoided. These are pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development. During sensitive periods most of the DNA methylation is removed from the genome and then the proper methylation pattern is set up. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because in the first case (treating patients during pre-implantation development, thus when a female is trying to conceive) could have dramatic effects on the offspring.  Any drug which effects epigenetic marks might have a drastic effect on the epigenome of the child. In the second case, during primordial germ cell development, the DNA methylation of the germ cells of the patient could become altered in undesirable ways resulting in the patients offspring having altered metagenomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, for example, in the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Regularly for the paternal allele, the H19 and an imprint control region are methylated, which prevents the CTCF insulator protein from binding to the imprint control region (ICR). When the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind, it can't prevent a downstream enhancer from activating the Igf gene. Thus, the paternal allele expresses Igf2 which is activated by the enhancers. In the maternal allele, however, both H19 and the CTCF insulator protein binding site are not methylated. Because the CTCF insulator can bind to the imprint control region, it insulates the Igf2 gene from being enhanced, and thus the Igf2 expression status is off (not expressed). Instead, the downstream enhancer enhances H19 which is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation in the maternal allele, and thus the maternal allele expresses Igf2 and does not express H19 (acts like the paternal allele). This results two alleles instead of one expressing (overexpression) of the growth (and tumour) promoting gene Igf2.</p></div>
