    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of a normal paternal allele has the imprint control region (CTCF) and H19 methylated. This allows the enhancers to express Igf2. On the the maternal allele, the imprint control region and H19 are not methylated allowing the enhancers to express H19. However, when both imprint control regions and H19 are hypermethylated in both the maternal and paternal alleles, the enhancers act upon Igf2. Overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoter, is assosiated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation starts with the hypomethylation of the CpG island and the methylation of the intergenic region, the repetitive elements of the DNA and in between the genes. In a cancer cell the CpG island are more likely to be methylated and the intergenic region, the repetitive elements and in between the genes are more likely to be hypomethylated. If a methylation of the CpG island occurs, it can silence tumor suppresser genes. This is mitotically heritable, and without an active growth suppresser, is able to spread quickly. Although methylation of the CpG island is associated with cancer, there must also be multiple methylations of other regions of the DNA to effectively silence tumor suppresser genes. An example is in the intergenic and repetitive element regions. If these are methylated it decreases the chance that a tumor suppressing gene will be promoted somewhere else within the DNA. Cancer being the result of multiple hits in the DNA was hypothesized by Knudson.          </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabin belongs to a class of drugs called DNA Methylation Transfer Inhibitors, or DNMTi. Along with another DNMTi, vidaza, decitaine is FDA approved. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that works well against Myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine removes inhibitory methyl groups from CpG island promoter sequences that are tumor suppressors. This removal can restore tumor suppressors and normal gene expression further down the DNA, ultimately leading to greater stability.</span></p>
<p><span>Of the four drugs approved by the FDA, all of them are not cellularly selective so small doses are used during therapy. However, they are also all effective against lymphoid malignancies and work well with each other. This translates to smaller doses of DNMTi, HDACi, and traditional chemotherapy that will lead to better survival rates and less side effects.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Demethylation and deacelylase drugs, such as decitabine and vorinostat, can produce a "memory" antitumor response that can be mitotically heritable. If these changes persist mitotically, they can be passed along to the offspring because of the lasting effect on the epigenome. This demethylation is important for research and treatment because cancer cells need, more than normal cells, DNA methylation to proliferate. </span></p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is when reprograming occurs during development. There are two periods when this occurs. The first is during pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development. During pre-implantation development, removal of the DNA methylation and histone marks in the genome are removed after the zygote is formed. After the blastocyst stage, the epigenetic marks are replaced until demethylation occurs the second time during primordial germ cell development. While this reprograming is occurring, the repeats of the genome remain methylated. This continued methylation of the repeats creates genome stability that is required for healthy development. Treating patients with a demethylating drug could jeopardize the methylation and silencing of the repeating elements in the genome. This will promote instability of the genome and may complicate development.</span></p></div>
