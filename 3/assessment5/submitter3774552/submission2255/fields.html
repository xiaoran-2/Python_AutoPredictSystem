    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="s2"><span><span class="s2">In the paternal chromosome the imprint control region is methylated so the CTCF cannot bind to the imprint control region so there will be no insulation of the Igf2 </span><span class="s2">will</span><span class="s2"> occur and the enhancer will be free to act on the Igf2 and promote the Igf2 expression. In the maternal chromosome the imprint control region is </span><span class="s2">unmethylated</span><span class="s2"> so the CTCF will bind to the imprint control </span><span class="s2">region which lead</span><span class="s2"> to insulation of the Igf2 from downstream to the enhancers. This will lead to the silencing of the Igf2 on the maternal chromosome.</span></span></p>
<p class="s2"><span><span class="s2">In </span><span class="s2">Wilm’s</span><span class="s2"> tumor the Cdkn1 is </span><span class="s2">hypermethylated</span><span class="s2"> which will lead to over expression of the Igf2. The </span><span class="s2">Cdkn1</span><span class="s2"> is </span><span class="s2">a tumor suppressor since it restrict</span><span class="s2"> growth of cells while the Igf2 is an oncogene since it promotes growth. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p class="s2"><span><span class="s2">The sensitive period is the period where the epigenetic factors are formed to be inherited </span><span class="s2">and then maintained</span><span class="s2">through  </span><span class="s2">life</span><span class="s2">. </span><span class="s2">These sensitive periods</span><span class="s2"> include the </span><span class="s2">promodial</span><span class="s2">germline</span><span class="s2"> and the </span><span class="s2">embryogenesis.
