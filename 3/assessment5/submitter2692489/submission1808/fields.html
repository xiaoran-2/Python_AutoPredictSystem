    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA refers to addition of methyl group to the cytosine base.The methyl group is laid down by DNA methyl transferases enzyme during cell division.Disruption of methylation patterns are usually associated with disruption of gene regulation leading to irregular gene function, disease and variable phenotype.</p>
<p>The CpG dinucleotides are found near the promotor region of the genes and they are usually clustered. In an actively transcribed gene the CpG islands are usually protected from methylation. DNA Methylation of CpG islands are associated with gene scilencing by either forming a repressive chromatin complex (by associating with MeCP proteins) or by preventing the transcription factors from binding to the promotor region.The CpG island can either be hypermethylated or hyopomethylated and are specific to a locus. Hypermethylation of the CpG island  in the cancer cells</p>
<ol><li>can lead to scilencing of important genes such as tumor suppressor gene leading to abnormal cell division.</li>
<li>a set of CpG islands called  CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)  can lead to colorectal cancer</li>
<li>CpG island shores (2kb region surrounding CpG region) leads to expression of a gene which are normally absent in the cell eg nerve sheath tumors </li>
<li>imprint control regions leads to loss of imprinting leading to loss of expression or over expression of a gene eg.wilm's tumor, X inactivation </li>
</ol><p>On the other hand, hypomethylation of the CpG islands can lead to a weak promotor thereby activating genes that are normally switched off eg., activation of oncogenes in cancer cells</p>
<p>The Methylation of intergenic regions and the repitive elements helps to maintain genomic stability by silencing the cryptic transcriptional start site or cryptic splice site and by preventing  transposition and illegitimate recombination respectively. Genome wide hypomethylation of these region can cause genomic instability and cancer by causing illegitimate recombination between chromosomes, activating transposon genes which might disrupt other gene functions, activation of cryptic promotors leading to disruption of the neighbouring genes activity, loss of imprinting and leading to activation of oncogene</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genome imprinting is a epigenetic process in which certain genes are expressed in mono alleclic parent of origin specific manner. One of the models to study the imprinting pattern is the H19/Igf2 cluster. The H19 gene expressed by the maternal allele and the Igf2 expressed by the paternal allele share a common enhancer. The enhancer is controlled by the insulator protein CTCF whose binding site (ICR) is located between the two genes. In the maternal allele the CTCF protein binds to the ICR and activates the H19 promoter. However this prevents Igf2 form accessing the promoter. In the paternal genome the ICR region is methylated which also spreads to the H19 promoter region. This methylation prevents the CTCF protein from binding to the ICR leading the enhancers to gain access to Igf2 and also scilences the H19 gene. Disruption in the methylation pattern of the ICR region H19/Igf2 along with Kcnq1cluster leads to beckwith- weidemann syndrome, where Igf2(oncogene) is overexpressed and the Cdkn1c (tumor supressor gene) is under expressed leading overgrowth of cells. This results in the fetal and postnatal overgrowth, macroglossia and childhood tumor. Similarly hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 ICR in the maternal chromosome leads to overexpression of Igf2 leading to Wilm's tumor due to overgrowth of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a FDA approved drug developed against the DNA methyl transferase enzyme. They belong to class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors. <span>Decitabine is</span> used to treat<span> myelodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor of <span>acute myeloid leukaemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into DNA during replication and irreversibly binds to the DNA methyl transeferases enzyme thereby preventing DNA synthesis and also causing hypomethylation of DNA. Since the drug binds to DNMT during replication they are replication dependent. In cancer cells, which are actively dividing, <span>Decitabine  at low dose is shown to have anti neopastic effect and hence useful in the teratment of cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epgenetic reprogramming occurs during the early developmet and primordial germ cell formation. During this period the epigenetic marks are completely removed and then relayed. Hence this is called the sensitive period as any disruption to the epigenome during this period leads to abnormalities.</p>
<p>A combination of drugs that target and alter DNA methylation are used to treat cancer. These drugs have longstanding effect as they target the epigenetic machinary which are heritable until they are cleared. The administration of these drugs during the sensitive period is not advisable as they may be ineffective or target the methylation that are newly laid.</p></div>
