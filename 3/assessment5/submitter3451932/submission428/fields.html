    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster has been linked to the childhood kidney tumour known as Wilm's tumour. The Igf2 or insulin-like growth factor 2 gene shares enhancers with the H19 gene. Between the two genes lies a CTCF dependent insulator that plays a role in determining which gene will be expressed in either the paternal or maternal chromosome. In normal cells, the maternal imprint control region  is not methylated which allows the insulator protein CTCF to bind at 4 binding sites. Therefore, the enhancers enhance expression of H19 on the maternal allele instead of Igf2. H19 is a long non-coding RNA that is a reservoir for miRNAs. The ICR of the paternal allele, however, is methylated. Therefore, enhancers downstream of the gene enhance the expression of Igf2.  With loss of imprinting there is HYPERmethylation on the materal allele. Therefore Igf2 is expressed instead of H10. This double dose of Igf2 - which is a growth promoter - leads to Wilm's tumour. Hypermthylation occurs early during tumourogenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p>THe role of DNA methylation in cancer is both context specific and stage dependent. Cancer cells have regions that are likely to be more methylated than normal cells yet they also have areas that tend to be less methylated. </p>
<p>CpG islands are often found at the promoters of genes. In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated. Low levels of methylation indicate that a gene is likely to be active. High levels of methylation at a CpG island would silence a gene through the formation of repressive chromatin. However, cancer cells show <strong>hypermethylation</strong> at CpG islands - particularly those of tumour suppressor genes. Silencing of these genes through methylation would promote tumourogenesis. Thus these mitotically heritable epimutations are rapidly selected for and occur frequently. In fact, tumour supressor hypermethylation is more common in cancers than genetic mutations. For example, there is hypermethylation associated with MLH1 in colorectal cancer and BRCA1 in breast cancer. </p>
<p>In normal cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated in order to maintain genomic stability. However, in cancer cells there is <strong>hypomethylation</strong> in these areas. Since hypomethylation is associated with gene activity, this can cause major disruptions to the genome. This occurs in every type of tumour, is seen early and progresses over time. For example, without methylation at repetitive elements, illegitimate recombination can occur. In normal cells this is prevented due to the formation of heterochromatin. In cancer cells repeats can also make copies of themselves and transpose across the genome. This can lead to the activation of neighbouring genes. In mice, deletion of Dnmt1 leads to hypomethylation which results in cancer. In humans, ICF syndrome can results from a mutation in DNMT3B. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can also lead to cancer because it can activate oncogenes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is a drug that is currently "used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia" (Cancer's). Because leukemia is associate with <em>increased</em> methylation at promoter sites, an inhibiting agent like decitabine (or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) can be useful to slow down the progression of the disease. The drug is a nucleoside analogue and works by forming irreversible bonds with the active sites of the DNA-methyltransferase enzymes (Issa et al. 1635). This leads to <strong>hypomethylation</strong> of the gene (such as a tumour supressor) and allows it to be expressed. This either causes apoptosis in the cell or reduces cell division as it begins to differentiate. Both of these effects would slow the growth of a cancerous tumour. Decitabine targets cells that are rapidly dividing i.e. cancer cells, and is useful in low doses to produce an anti-neoplastic effect.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods of development include the pre-implantation period (after fertilization) and primordial germ cell development. These are sensitive periods because this is when epigenetic reprogramming is occuring. In the pre-implantation period, reprogramming allows epigenetic marks from the sperm and egg to be removed in order to restore totipotency in the zygote. During primordial germ cell development, there is differential resetting in oogenesis and spermatogenesis mid-gestation. Treating patients during primordial germ cell development could result in imprinting disorders. When using a drug like decitabine that results in hypomethylation, important epigenetic marks could be missing that distinguish maternal and paternal chromosomes. This could potentially lead to disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome or Angelman Syndrome.</p>
