    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;">DNA methylation at CpG islands results in methylation of the cytosine component of a CG sequence. This prevents RNA polymerase from accessing the region of the CpG island, preventing the island region from being transcribed. CpG islands are often associated with promoters. Many of the genes on CpG islands are tumor-suppressing genes. Cancer is often associated with methylation of CpG islands. Thus, hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer often results in lower expression of tumor-suppressing genes, which contributes to the growth of tumors, especially in conjunction with hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span></p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements often results in a suppression of transcription around these regions. Many intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated with unstable regions in the genome (like transposon), and do not necessarily code for proteins. These regions are usually highly methylated in normal cells. But cancer often causes a suppression of methylation in these regions, which increases the amount of transcription that these regions, which contributes to genomic instability. Increased genomic instability (translocations, jumping genes, etc), then contributes to cancer. This is especially common when a gene in one chromosome gets translocated to a region in another chromosome, and ends up getting overexpressed due to being downstream of the promoter in the other chromosome. </p>
<p>So in general, cancer is associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation in intergeneic regions and repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of normal controls, the H19 cluster is methylated. H19 prevents enhancers from accessing Igf2, so preventing the expression of H19 results in a positive Igf2 expression status for the paternal allele. Meanwhile, the H19 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This means that H19 is able to be expressed, which then inhibits Igf2 from being expressed. So Igf2 status is negative on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In patients with Wilm's tumor, the H19 cluster is methylated on both the maternal and paternal chromosomes.  This means that that enhancers downstream of the cluster enjoy unrestrained access to the Igf2 gene on both the maternal and paternal cluster, resulting in twice the normal expression of Igf2 - in normal controls, Igf2 would only be expressed from the paternal chromosome alone.</p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at the Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer because Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene. Without imprinting, the cell gets twice the dose of Igf2, which can contribute to cancer, as cancer is associated with anomalously high levels of cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It basically inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferases on DNA molecules, which reduces hypermethylation and can increase the expression of genes that were previously silenced. This can help increase the expression of tumor-suppressing genes, which are often inhibited by hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancerous cells, and can treat cancers associated with hypermethylation of these islands. </p>
<p>When a cell divides, it relies on DNA methyltransferase enzymes to pass on its methylation marks onto its daughter cells. When these enzymes are inhibited by an agent like Decitabine, these methylation marks cannot be passed onto its daughter cells. So once a carcinogenic methylation change (like hypermethylation of CpG islands) is erased, it does not return. This is effectively effective in cancer, as cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells. So Decitabine can be a more effective long-term treatment than other agents.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Reducing DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since certain enzymes (like DNA methyltransferases) are necessary for maintaining DNA methylation in a cell when a cell passes on its methylation status to its daughter cells. So if a cell divides, and DNA methyltransferase enzymes are inhibited, then its daughter cells will not have the same methylation that its parent cells had. Moreover, these methylation marks are effectively lost forever.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of time when certain cells of an organism undergoes significant amounts of epigenetic reprogramming. Sensitive periods of development include times when an organism's germ cells (eggs, sperm) are developing. So if someone is expecting to become a parent in the near-future, then treating them with DNA methylation drugs could result in en erasure of epigenetic marks that are important for their developing organism. So disrupting methylation could result in loss of methylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster, which results in no Igf2 expression in the parental chromosome, and inviable offspring. So if someone is expecting to have children anytime soon, they should not be treated with epigenetic drugs. </p></div>
