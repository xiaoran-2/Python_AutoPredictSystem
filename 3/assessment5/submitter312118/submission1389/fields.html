    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the DNA sites where methylation occurs is CpG islands. These are repeats of cytosine and guanine nucleotides usually located in the promoter regions of many genes. Methylation of CpG islands serves a silencing function - a methylated gene promoter can attract chromatin remodelling proteins which condense chromatin or, less often, methylated DNA can prevent transcription factors from binding to it.</p>
<p>In many types of cancer CpG islands can be hypermethylated, however the hypermethylation is locus-specific i.e. in each type of cancer different parts of genome or even single genes are affected. The genes that are silenced by CpG hypermethylation in cancer most probably are tumour suppressors - genes that provide growth limiting function and, when silenced cannot longer suppress the growth of some cells which become malignant.</p>
<p>Another place where disruption of DNA may take place in cancer is intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In a healthy state these DNA strands are hypermethylated which silences various sequences which pose danger to genome stability - these are transposons and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Conversely to CpG islands, intergenic regions in cancer are hypomethylated globally. In this situation genome instability may be caused by de-silencing of repetitive DNA sequences which, when aligned to each other, can lead to DNA recombination and also by transposable elements which are no longer silenced and can jump from one locus to another causing insertion mutations. These mutations can disrupt normal genes or they can activate so-called cryptic promoters and lead to unwanted gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is another epigenetic phenomenon observed in cancer. In the case of imprinting the two alleles inherited from father and mother are expressed differently. For example in normal (healthy) conditions maternal Igf2 gene <span>is repressed in a way that an insulator protein CTCF binds to an unmethylated ICR region downstream to Igf2. The lack of methylation directs the DNA enhancer regions that are even more downstream to activating the H19 gene instead of Igf2. Converesely, in paternal allele the ICR is methylated and it prevents CTCF from binding to ICR. The methylation also spreads to the promoter of H19. In this situation the downstream enhancers can interact with Igf2 promoter and activate its transcription. </span></p>
<p><span>In case of Wilm's tumour the maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster behaves as paternal allele. This can happen due to mutation</span> causing loss of imprinting, uniparental disomy or <span>epigenetic disruption. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene, the two copies of it causes uncontrolled growth of cells.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating angent which belongs to the class of epigenetic drugs called DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which, when incorporated into DNA binds DNMT enzyme irreversibly thus preventing DNA methylation in replication-dependent manner. This prevention of DNA methylation may be preventing the ill-borne silencing of tumour suppressor genes and thus have anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The enduring effect of methylation on the epigenome is explained by the fact that these marks are inheritable. The methylation marks are passed on during cell division by the help of methyltransferase enzymes which put methyl groups on the nonmethylated strand of the hemimethylated DNA molecule. These methylation marks are carried on until they are actively errased.</p>
<p>The period in which the epigenetic marks are deleted and reprogrammed is called a sensitive period. Any environmental effects or lack of certain inter- and intracellular signals may disrupt this epigenetic reprogramming. In terms of epigenetics two sensitive periods are known - during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period in early human development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods with medicine that acts on epigenetic marks may be detrimental to such patients' offspring because of disruption of genetic reprogramming. Many processes that take place during these periods can be affected, such as errasure of maternal/paternal genome or, vice versa - the persistance of imprinted genes or IAPs.</p></div>
