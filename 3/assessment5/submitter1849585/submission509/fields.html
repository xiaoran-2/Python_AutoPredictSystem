    <h1>Submission 509 from Anon (session_user_id: c65394ad3c54421d29884c0c507d7ca168713e99)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>
<p><span style="color:#1c3387;">Deitabine is used to treat disfunctional blood cells and acute myeloid leukemia.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#1c3387;">Decitabine is a drug that functions as a hypomethylating agent. It mode of action is to inhibit DNA methyl transferase.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#1c3387;">DNA methyl trasferase is a family of enzymes that catalyse the addition of a methyl group to DNA via a cytodine nucleoside. . DNA methylation is often associated with cancers especially if the methylation occurs in CpG islands in the region of promoters of for example tumour supressor genes. The relatively baulky methyl groupd can prevent the trasciption of these important genes by preventing the trasciption machinery from gaiining access to the promotor and hence preventing gene transciption.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#1c3387;">Decitabine being a cytodine  analog  is incorporated into the DNA strand and then it binds DNA methyl transferase irreversibly.  The amount of freely available DMTA decreases. The result is the loss of silencing marks and the subsequent transciption of genes that had been silenced.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">In a normal cell CpG islands are  unmethylated  and gene intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated<br /> CpG islands are often located near promoter regions of genes.<br /><br /> However in cancer the CpG islands are hypermethylated - one hit in the Knudson model. These changes are then mitotically heritable. Because the tumour suppressor genes cannot be expressed these altered cells tend to replicate much more quickly then normal  cells and tend to live longer and so  have a competitive advantage and so begin to predominate - hence tumorgenesesis can spread.<br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">It has also been found  by gene wide studies that the identity of hyper methylation of CpG islands varies by tumor type.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">Additionally areas near CpG islands the so called CpG island shores are also hypermethylated in tumors resulting in further silencing of the gene.<br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /> DNA intergenic regions and repetitive regions are much more common then CpG islands and so the state of DNA methylation is just as important . </span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">In normal cells hyper methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elments ensures genome stability. Because these regions are methylated and chromatin heavily compacted it is less likely that DNA in these cells  <span> will undergo illegitimate recombination</span> and that cells will gain or loose chromosomes.<br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /> However in  cancer, interegenic and repetitive  elements are hypo methylated and as such genome stabiltiy can result from illegitimate recombination between repeates. Additionally repeats can be activated to make copies of themselves and traspose to other parts of the genome. They can therefore either disrupt or activate other genes. This can result in uncontrolled growth and or disruption of tumor suppessor genes - all of which contributes to cancer.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">Overall deletions, insertions and recombination levels tend to increase.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">The effect of the level of DNA methylation is context dependent.  Different tumors have different dependencies. If cancer is driven by tumor suppression hyper methylation, then depletement of DNA methylation supresses  tumor genesis. If driven by chromosomal instability depletion of DNA methylation enhances tumor genesis.<br /></span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">Cancer cells display loss of imprinting - genes that normally should display mono allelic parent of origin specific expression no longer do so - the result is expression from both alleles or no expression at all (silencing)</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">Many imprinted genes are are involved in cell growth either in promotion or suppression.Disruption of this system can result in abnormal cell growth.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">An  important element of the imprinted genes is the the ICR. With  abnormal  hyper or hypo methylation the result can be disruption of the gene function.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">In the Igf2/H19  case in normal cells the ICR is methylated on the pateral allele and un methylated on the maternal allele. When un methylated ie on the maternal allelle CTCF binds the insulator region, this allows the enhancers to act on H19 so this gene is exprsessed while Igf2 in silenced.<br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">On the paternal allele because of the silencing of the ICR,  enhancers result  in Igf2  expression.</span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;"><br /></span></div>
<div><span style="color:#1c3387;">However with the loss of imprinting methylation also occurs on the maternal allele. CTFC can no longer bind the ICR; so Igf2 is expressed as well as on the paternal allele - this results in a double dose of Igf2 produced. Igf2 is  growth promoting - an increase rate of cell growth occurs and this causes a condition called Wilm's tumor.</span></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has effects that last beyond the treatment period due to trasgenerational inheritance via the gametes.  This can be achieved by either incomplete epigenetic reprogramming and by possible mediation via piRNAs.</p>
<p> Sensitive periods in humans refrers to a period in development where there is removal and the laying down of epigenetic marks of the genome. This can be seen in the level of DNA methylation which dectreaes and then increases.</p>
<p>The two major sensitive periods are during Primordial germ cell  development through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The second period is pre implanatation and the early post implmentation period. However there are also some sensitive periods during the somatic maintenance periods. In particular  the Dutch famine studies identified  the peri implantation period and the Overlix study identfied possible correlation between grandparents (father = 9 to 12 years, mother 8 to 10 years) and diseases in their grandchildren..</p>
<p> If so then it may be to advisable to avoid these periods when treatment is given. This is because during these sensitive periods the genome  more susceptible to the environment eg drug administration. It is thus possible that any effects produced by these medications may be passed on to future generations and may have unforseen consequences.</p></div>
