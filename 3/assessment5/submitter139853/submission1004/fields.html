    <h1>Submission 1004 from Anon (session_user_id: ac7d9fa2d9ae1cdf7f08b0d3950eecee48a0a571)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). <span><span>It is FDA-approved for use against myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</span></span></p>
<p>The effects of Decitabine are not fully understood. In vitro, Decitabine leads to passive DNA demethylation by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). During DNA replication, a double strand of DNA is split into two daughter strands. Normally, DNMT lays down methylation on the new daughter strands of DNA. Decitabine, a nucleoside analog, inserts itself into the genome and "traps" DNMT. When DNMT is inhibited, new daughter strands cannot be methylated and epigenetic marks are dilluted out. This process is known as passive DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>Cancer is associated with hypomethylation of the entire genome, and hypermethylation at certain genes. In particular, tumor-suppressor genes are methylated and thereby silenced. By inhibiting methylation, Decitabine may turn these genes back "on", thereby reactivating the body's natural tumor suppressor mechanism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high concentration of cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG). CpG islands tend to be gene promoters. </span>Normally, CpG islands are not methylated. When it is present, methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing. Two mechanism lead to silencing. First, methylation at CpG islands attracts MeCP proteins, which recruit other proteins that condense the chromatin into tightly packed heterochromatin. Second, MeCP proteins prohibit transcription factors from binding to the CpG island.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. As a result, certain gene promoters are silenced and their associated genes are "turned off."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Normally, tumor-suppressor proteins keep cell growth and division in check. When tumor-suppressor genes are silenced, tumors are able to form and grow out of control.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive regions, formerlly referred to as "junk DNA", are vast regions of DNA that do not code for proteins. These regions are normally methylated. Methylation helps to compact these regions into tightly packaged heterochromatin. In a tightly packaged state, the heterochromatin is less suseptible to mutation.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can lead to mutations in the genome. "Oncogenes", or genes that cause cancer, can be activated.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) stimulates cell growth and division while H19 impedes it. With normal doses of Igf2 and H19, an organism grows to a normal size. The absence of H19 leads to an abnormally large organism, while the absence of Igf2 leads to an abnormally small organism. (If both genes are missing, the organism will be normal size.)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">H19 and Igf2 are imprinted genes: they are differentially expressed from the paternal and materal alleles. On a normal paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) blocks binding of the CTCF domain. The methylation spreads to the H19 gene, thereby silencing it. An upstream gene ehancer targets target the Igf2 gene, increasing its potency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On a normal maternal allele, H19 is not methylated (expressed) while the Igf2 gene is methylated (silenced). The H19 gene is enhanced by upstream enhancer genes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In some disorders, including Wilm's tumor, imprinting of the H19/Igf2 locus is disrupted. Rather than being expressed, H19 is silenced on the maternal allele. Instead of targeting H19, the enhancers target Igf2.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span><span>As a result, the organism gets a double dose of Igf2, which in turn leads to uncontrolled tumor growth (Wilm's tumor).</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>By definition, epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable: they are preserved during mitosis. Epigenetic marks may also be trans-generationally inherited, or preserved during meiosis.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">At certain times during development, epigenetic marks are wiped from the genome and laid down afresh. These periods are known as "sensitive periods." During sensitive periods, environmental factors can affect the epigenome. In turtles, temperature during a sensitive period determines sex. <span><span> In mammals, diet and maternal stress may affect the offspring's susceptibility to obesity and depression.</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mammals undergo two special phases of epigenetic reprogramming. The first occurs during gametogensis, when a primordial germ cell develops into a mature egg or sperm cell. The second sensitive period occurs during the early stages of embryo development: before and slightly after the embryo implants in the uterus.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In studies on mice, disrupted methylation during sensitive periods had lethal consequences. </span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation, such as Decitabine, should not be used by pregnant women, women who may soon become pregnant, or men who may soon father children (people who are in the midst of embryo development or gametogensis). By inhibiting methylation during a sensitive period, these drugs would be lethal.</p></div>
