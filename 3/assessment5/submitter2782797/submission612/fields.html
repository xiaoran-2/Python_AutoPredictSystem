    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cells is loss of imprinting. This occurs in Wilm’s tumor where the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted.</p>
<p>                  This cluster consists (in this order) of the Igf2 gene, the Imprinted Control Region (ICR), the H19 gene coding for a lncRNA and enhancers.</p>
<p>                  It is paternally imprinted and is therefore methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>                  On the paternal allele, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote its expression. The methylation of the ICR is able to spread to the promoter of H19, which is a CpG promoter. Thus methylation leads to H19 silencing.</p>
<p>                  On the maternal allele, the unmethylated ICR is able to bind the protein CTCF. CTCF is an insulator element. In that case, the enhancers act on H19 expression and Igf2 is silenced on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>                  In the Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of the maternal allelle is also found to be methylated, leading to the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele too. In Wilm’s tumor cells, we therefore have a double expression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting factor. This higher expression of Igf2 can therefore promote the tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery of the cells is becoming an intense field of research in oncology.</p>
<p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyl-transferase (DNMT) that is FDA approved for Myelodysplastic syndrome that progressed to Acute Myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated in DNA during replication. Decitabine then irreversibly bind DNMTs, which leads to a reduction of DNA methylation in the cells. As the action of Decitabine requires replication, cancer cells which are replicating faster than normal cells will be more affected.</p>
<p>Although the DNMT inhibitors have been used since a while, the mode of action is not clear. It is believed that they act by enabling the re-expression of genes which promoter had been methylated in tumor cells. These inhibitors are indeed very efficient in myelodysplastic syndrome that are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. Such genes could be tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It has been shown that cancer cells display epigenetic modifications when compared to normal cells. One of these modifications is the methylation of the DNA. Cancer celles display a genome wide hypomethylation with some Locus specific DNA hypermethylation</p>
<p>As a general rule, in normal ceels, CpG in gene promoters are not methylated. If they are found to be methylated, then this is associated with gene expression silencing.</p>
<p>In general in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell.</p>
<p>This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG Islands can contribute to cancers as many tumor suppressor genes are found to be silenced through these epigenetics modifications. Moreover, Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. The affected tumor suppressor genes are different from cancers to cancers.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the genome is in general methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The methylation of these elements are believed to maintain the integrity of the genome.</p>
<p>In general, in a cancer cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be hypomethylated. This was in fact the first epigenetic abnormality identified in cancer cells. It is found in all cancers cells and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation of this elements leads to a genomic instability (insertion, deletion, translocation) that can activate oncogenes and take part in the tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation using drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome even after the period of treatment. DNA methylation marks modifications induced by drugs are indeed mitotically heritable. The effect can than last after the treatment is over.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where the « environment » is able to modify the epigenetic marks of a cell. These periods correspond to periods where there is active remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>There are two main sensitive periods. The first one is the pre-implantation and early post-implantation of an embryo. The second one is the period of primordial germ cells development (development of mature oocytes and spermatozoids).</p>
<p>Although drugs targeting the epigenetic machinery seem to be a powerful concept to treat cancers, it would not be advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods. For instance, the use of these drugs in young patients who are generating germ cells could lead to abnormal germ cells and subsequent abnormalities if these germ cells are used to get an embryo. Moreover, the use of such drugs in an early pregnant woman could also lead to epigenetic abnormalities in the embryo and subsequent phonotypical abnormalities.</p></div>
