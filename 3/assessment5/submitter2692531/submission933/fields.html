    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells (ESC). DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons). The cause of reduced amount of methylcytosine observed in human tumors has not been determined.Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA Despite global hypomethylation, high activity of DNA methyltransferases has been detected in multiple human tumor types. This increase may be related to higher proliferation rate of malignant cells. Besides global hypomethylation, most cancers also show focal hypermethylation in distinct subsets of promoter-associated CpG islands. Affected genes are permanently silenced, since methylation marks are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone. Aberrant de novo hypermethylation occurring in transformed cells serves as an alternative mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Hundreds to thousands of genes can be epigenetically silenced by CpG island hypermethylation in human cancer, suggesting a general disturbance of epigenetic memory. Methylation affects individual cancer patients with varying extent. While some patients have minimal changes, others show concordant hypermethylation of multiple genes.  Thus, recent reports have identified genomic regions, which are associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns regulating gene expression profiles and chromatin compartmentalization.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Permanent inactivation of one X chromosome in females and parental imprinting of specific genes on autosomes are the best examples of stable epigenetic silencing exerted on one allele. Transcription factors present in the cell nucleus regulate expression of only the other nonsilenced allele. The genes encoding insulin-like growth factor 2 (<em>IGF2</em>) and <em>H19</em> are located ∼120 kb apart on human chromosome 11p15.5 and are reciprocally imprinted, leading to paternal expression of <em>IGF2</em> and maternal expression of <em>H19</em> in most tissues. Parental allelic expression is determined by an imprinting control region (ICR) located between the two genes, upstream of the <em>H19</em> promoter. The current model for the mechanism underlying this reciprocal imprinting proposes a critical role for CTCF, which binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR. The loss of differential methylation at the <em>IGF2</em> imprinting control region (ICR1), located just upstream of the <em>H19</em> promoter, correlates with LOI in Wilms tumors, bladder cancer  and colon cancer. Changes in CpG methylation in other regions may also be associated with LOI in colon cancer. We have only a rudimentary understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying imprinting or LOI of the human gene, and we do not really know if, or understand why, LOI should lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
