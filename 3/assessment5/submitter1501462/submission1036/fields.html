    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the fundamental characteristics of epigenetics is DNA methylation: the laying down of a methyl group on the cytosine of a CpG dinucleotide pair.  This methylation is mitotically heritable and affects chromatin structure (more methylation, more compact chromatin; less methylation, more open chromatin) and gene activation/silencing.</p>
<p>Epigenetics research has determined that a normal genome has average patterns of DNA methylation -- typically, CpG islands (groups of CpGs found at gene promoters) are <strong><em>un</em></strong>methylated, while intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns have methylation scattered throughout.  The lack of methylation at CpG islands keeps the associated gene promoters active (methylation would prevent transcription factors from binding at promoters), while the methylation in the other areas is a hallmark of inactivity, and promotes genetic integrity by preventing chromosomal modifications (duplications, insertions, deletions and translocations) and inhibiting the various deleterious effects of repetitive elements (mutagenic transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate combination).</p>
<p>In cancer, these two patterns are switched, denoted by <em>hyper</em>methylation at CpG islands (and CpG island shores) while the repeats and other intergenic regions become <em>hypo</em>methylated.  The increased methylation at CpG islands is associated with gene silencing (by preventing transcription factors from binding), particularly of tumor suppressor genes.  The decreased methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability (chromosomal deletions, insertions, etc.).  In particular, the lack of methylation in transposable elements increases mutagenic transposition (without methylation, the strong promoters of repeats are now easily accessed and thus activated), transcriptional interference (without methylation, cryptic promoters are activated), and illegitimate recombination (lack of methylation opens chromatin, causing recombination in areas aligning with similar repeats on other chromosomes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal expression of Igf2, a growth promoter, occurs from the paternal allele only, due to imprinting.</p>
<p>The maternal allele's expression is prevented due to lack of methylation of the maternal ICR (imprint control region) to which the CTCF complex binds (it is an insulator protein that only binds to an unmethylated ICR), insulating the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers (which are needed to activate Igf2 expression).  In this way, Igf2 is suppressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Due to paternal imprinting, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele.  This prevents the CTCF complex from binding to the paternal ICR, and the enhancers then preferentially loop with Igf2, resulting in activation and expression.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's Tumor, a childhood kidney disease, the maternal allele is <em>also</em> methylated, thus behaving the same as the paternal allele (no CTCF binding, so no insulator preventing the enhancers from chromatin looping with Igf2), resulting in <em>both</em> alleles expressing Igf2.  As Igf2 is a growth promoter, this overexpression causes a tumor of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many pharmaceutical companies are developing small molecule inhibitors to target epigenetic machinery, to help treat cancer via epigenetic alterations.  One class of these drugs works to inhibit DNA Methyl Transferases (DNMTs); a drug of this class is called a DNA Methyl Transferase Inhibitor, or <em>DNMTi</em>.  Decitabine is one such drug, already approved by the FDA for cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Decitabine permanently binds to DNMTs such that in cell replication, DNA methylation (normally put down as copies on daughter strands) is prevented.  Dividing cells then have continually reduced DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation at CpG islands causes failure to express genes which inhibit cell growth, also called "tumor suppressors".  With Decitabine present, this hypermethylation will be reduced or removed (in dividing cells), thus enabling these genes to do their tumor suppressing work again.  In this way, Decitabine targets malignancies caused by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell division (mitosis), DNA methylation is copied from the parent strand to the daughter strand.  This is the basis for mitotic heritability in epigenetics.  A drug that alters DNA methylation can thus have long term effects on the epigenome by disrupting the laying down of copied epigenetic marks -- as subsequent generations of cells would not have the original marks to copy, even if the drug itself is no longer present.</p>
<p>It is important to note that drugs that alter DNA methylation will affect cells whenever DNA methylation is being laid down.  Which is not only during normal cell division (mitosis), but also during the "sensitive periods" of primordial germ cell development, early embryonic development, and specific stages of cell differentiation.  During these sensitive periods, DNA methylation is erased and laid down anew.  Inhibiting DNA methylation during this active remodeling could have severe deleterious consequences; thus it would be inadvisable to treat patients with such drugs at those times.</p></div>
