    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a typical function of a heathly cell. In a healthy cell, Hypermethylation can be found in the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and in the gene itself. The CpG islands are not hypermethylated. In contrast, cancerous cells are found to be the opposite with hypomethylation of the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and in the gene. While, the CpG islands are heavily methylated. This hypermathylation of the CpG islands is importante as the hypermethylation is typically found in tumour suppressor genes, in effect turning the suppression off. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to insure genetic stability. The effects of hypomethylation of these regions can cause a loss of genetic stability resulting in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. The resulting increasing in genetic instability has been linked to the formation of different types of cancer. It is important to remember that the results of DNA methylation is context dependant.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The typically imprinting pattern of the H19/Igf2 cluster consist of an imprinted paternal allele that blocks the enhancers from acting on h19 instead acting upon Igf2. The maternal allel is not imprinted, allowing the enhancers to instead act upon h19. In Wilm's tumour, the loss of imprinting results in the expression of both the maternal and paternal allele. This results in the double expression of Igf2 instead of the single dose from one parental allele, as happens during a typical imprinted gene. This double dose of the expression of Igf2 results in devolpement cancerous tumour in the kidneys known as Wilm´s tumour. Since it is mitotically heritable, it developes early and is often seen in children but rarely in adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p title="DNA methyltransferase">Decitabine is a drugs produced by Eisai and marketed as Dacogen. It is a DNA-demethylating agent or a hypomethylating agent. Decitabine hypomethylates the DNA via inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This can be benefical in cancer because in cancer cells, CpG islands are typically hypermethylated. CpG islands are often located in tumour suppressor genes. This hypermethylation of the CpG regions in the tumour suppressor genes inhibits the suppressor gene from working, allowing the cancerous tumuors to grow. With the use of Decitabine, the hypermethylated CpG islands would be returned to their hypomethylated states, allowing the tumour suppresor gene to function and inhibit the growth of the cancerous tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and will be passed on throughout the persons life time. No until germ cell development are the epigenetic marks reset. This allows the epigenetic drugs Dr. Baylin speaks about to have lasting effects. Since these drugs have lasting effects it would not be asvisable to treat patients with these drugs during sensitive periods in the epigenome. These sensitive periods are when epigenetics markers have been earsed and new epigenetics markers are being layed down. This have been found during gametogenesis and during preimplantation embryonic stage. Using drugs that alter the epigenetic state during these sensitive periods could unforeseen consequences to the development of the epigenetic state.</p></div>
