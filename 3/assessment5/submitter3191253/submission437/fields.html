    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells are differentiated into the various tissue types. Cells express different genes in different tissues,which means that only certain genes are activated to give the tissue it's specific function and characteristics. Methylation of DNA (and other mechanisms) play an important role in the regulation of this gene expression and in general is associated with inactivation (repression) of gene expression .In normal healthy cells on the whole there will be no methylation of the CpG islands in the promotor regions of genes, active as well as inactive ones. But DNA methylation will be found on the DNA of repetitive elements and the intergenic regions and even on the introns of genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there are two major shifts in the pattern of DNA methylation. Firstly there is the locus specific DNA hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes.This means that these genes no longer suppress growth (cell division) ,and the tumor can expand. Methylation here increases with time and will include neighboring regions of the promotors.Secondly there is a genome wide hypomethylation at the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions,the introns off genes and at CpG poor promotors. Thirdly there are alterations in DNA methylation (hypo or hyper methylation) at imprint control regions of imprinted genes .</p>
<p>In healthy cells repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated ,so heterochromatin is formed here and repression takes place. In cancer these regions become hypomethylated, becoming euchromatinized. Because of the similarity of repeats illegitimate recombinations occur. Hypomethylation of repeats  also means they will make copy's of themselves. These then will jump around in the genome disrupting coding regions of genes and activating neighboring genes dependent upon where they settle.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A large number of tumours show loss of imprinting. One place where this can occur is the H19/Igf2 cluster of genes. This cluster is controlled by an imprint control region ( ICR ) that is imprinted ( or methylated ) on the paternal allele. This means that the ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated  in healthy cells. The nonmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is able to bind an insulator protein CTCF. This causes down stream enhancers not being able to reach the upstream Igf2 oncogene, with the effect that this gene is not expressed on the maternal allele ( but the enhancers can then reach H19 which is expressed instead ). The opposite is true for the paternal allele. Here the ICR is methylated, CTCF therefore cannot bind on it, the enhancers are able to reach Igf2 and this gene is expressed.This is monoallelic gene expression of Igf2 in healthy cells.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor loss of imprinting occurs at this particular ICR ,which means hypermethylation at the ICR on the maternal allele. Now both the paternal and the maternal allele work in the same way, which results in over expression of Igf2 , and abnormal cell growth .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a methyltransferaseinhibitor. Its structure is very similar to 5-azacytidine. It is a cytidine analogue and a nucleoside molecule. After modification,the decitabine molecule is incorporated in the DNA upon replication. There they interact with all three DNA methyltransferases with which they bond. In the following rounds of DNA replication and cell division, DNA  methylation is inhibited. In myeloid dysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia this drug is particularly effective ,probably because these cancers are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation, and therefore sensitive to the inhibition of  methylation ,but this is not known for certain. This drug acts in principle on all the cells of the body.Because these cancer cells divide so quickly, they are more affected than other cells. The drug is given in a low dosage, in higher higher dosages decitabine becomes toxic and less effective against the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Drugs that alter DNA methylation, means that methylation marks on the DNA are affected, changed. Since these marks are mitotically heritable, subsequent cells of the lineage will also be affected and so the effect of the  drug is lasting ( passed on to the daughter cells ). In principal cells of all the tissues in the body can be affected. Their long term effect is not known. Therefore doctors are carefull to use the drugs, that are approved by the FDA, only on elderly patients, where increasing life expectancy and side effects are important and longer term consequences can be ignored. Because these drugs can effect all the cells of the body and in particular those cells that divide the most, they are not used on people in sensitive periods. That is people who still have to grow or people, who still can have children ( with developing germ cells) and especially pregnant mothers.</p>
