    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>

<div>
<div>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is an analogue of cytosine, one of the four DNA bases. Rapidly growing cancer cells incorporate decitabine in place of cytosine during DNA replication. But methyltransferases are not able to add methyl groups to decitabine. If a tumour suppressor gene might otherwise be epigenetically regulated by a methylated cytosine in a cancerous cell, decitabine prevents this methylation silencing the gene, instead leading to activation of the tumour suppressor gene and an inhibition of tumour growth. These features make decitabine a particularly effective chemotherapy as it targets cancerous cells while having a negligible effect on healthy, normally functioning cells.  </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><div><span>Methylation of regions in gene promotors can control the expression of genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands within the promotor regions of tumour suppressor genes have much higher levels of methylation than for normal healthy cells. Hypermethylation of these regions leads to a reduction in expression of tumour suppressor genes. Their absence can cause cancerous cells to grow more rapidly, or to metastasize, for example. Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In intergenic regions, and repetitive elements, methylation helps maintain genomic integrity. If intergenic regions are hypomethylated, they may no longer silence cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites. This could lead to a loss of gene function. If repetitive elements are hypomethylated, DNA may recombine at these repeats, or transposition could happen. Disrupting DNA replication may cause subsequent generations of cells to lose or gain function. In this way, hypomethylation of intergenic regions or repetitive elements can cause or exacerbate disease.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><span>H19 is a long, non-coding RNA gene, and Igf2 is a gene that encodes Insulin growth factor 2, which as its name suggests, is a growth factor and is also an oncogene. These two genes are located within the same locus of chromosome 11. In normal cells, the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Expression of these genes is modified by nearby promotor regions, with methylation of sites upstream of H19 on the paternal gene. On the maternal gene, these same sites are unmethylated. For cells of the kidney in Wilm's tumor, the promotor regions are methylated on both maternal and paternal alleles. This means that H19 is not expressed, and in fact, Igf2 is overexpressed. This is the cause of the abnormal growth seen in Wilm's tumour. This same epigenetic effect is seen in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. In these patients, as a result of a disruption to X-imprinting, and a loss of the CTCF protein that otherwise prevents Igf2 being acted on by downstream promotors. activation of the maternal allele in effect behaves like the paternal allele, although this syndrome is caused by additional disruption at another gene cluster.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><span>DNA methylation occurs with different frequency depending on the cell type within the body and the period of development. A sensitive period is one where the epigenetic marks on the sell, such as methylation, are removed and reestablished. These are the period of early development, from fertilisation to formation of the blastocyst, as well as formation of primordial germ cells and gametes. DNA methylation is important for maintenance of normal gene function within the body, as part of processes like X-chromosome inactivation.    Although the regulation of DNA methylation can malfunction in cancer, it is of critical importance during the sensitive periods. If DNA methylation were disrupted during these periods, X-imprinting could malfunction. As a bigger issue, modification of methylation is critical for the cell differentiation that occurs during early stages of development. Inhibiting these periods may cause permanent damage to the gametes, and thus to the offspring.</span></div></div>
