    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a dominant and well characterized mechanism in epigenetics; it is associated in general with silencing or inactivation of gene expression by forming a repressive chromatin structure. Normally the CpG islands are kept in an unmethylated state due to most of them are in close relation with promoter regions of relevant set of genes that need to be active constitutively. However in cancer there is an aberrant pattern in which a hypermethylation of these CpG islands is a common feature resulting in silencing, in this case, of tumor suppressor genes. This phenomenon would favor an uncontrolled cellular growth profile leading in turn to a higher risk for developing malignancy. In a similar but opposite way under physiological conditions there is a predilection for methylation of intergenic intervals and repetitive elements, and the purpose of this is basically to maintain a genomic stability by either silencing cryptic transposition or repressing abnormal splicing sites and poor promoters. Nevertheless in cancer occurs an abnormal genome wide DNA hypomethylation in these specific regions (in this way increasing chromatin accessibility for inappropriate and excessive activation), which can lead to illegitimate recombination of repeats or activation of cryptic promoters, both mechanisms causing disruption (by insertion, deletion, translocation or duplication) of neighboring clusters of genes that are essential for controlling cellular differentiation and growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster acts by enhancer/insulator blocking mechanism. Because these genes (H19 and Igf2) share the same enhancers and insulator protein (CTCF protein insulates Igf2 from downstram enchancers), their expression depends on the methylation state of the control region which in turn is parent of origin specific; normally in the paternal allele there is a methylation of the ICR and this blocks CTCF from binding, which allows DNA methylation to reach the H19 promoter and silence it. As a consequence enhancers gain access to the Igf2 gene which is then finally expressed.  Meanwhile the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated leading CTCF to bind; this blocks enhancers to reach distal Igf2 but lead downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter preferentially, which is then activated. Many inprinted genes are involved in growth processes and loss of imprinting is characteristic of cancer; If the maternal allele is lost or changed in a way that resembles the paternal allele causing methylation of the ICR of the cluster, the Ifg2 gene is then upregulated and it has been associated with predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors like Wilm´s tumor due to Ifg2 is predominantly an oncogene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of drug approved by the FDA for certain types of cancer. By causing DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) irreversible inhibition, it is essentially a drug that targets enzymatic epigenetic regulators and acts like a DNA demethylating agent. It´s been suggested that this demethylating effect can be used to counteract the hypermethylation (silencing) of tumor suppressor genes observed in some preneoplastic states like the myelodysplastic syndromes, which are known conditions that are precursors of some malignancies (specially hematological ones like acute myelogenous leukaemia). Therefore if the main epigenetic aberration pattern is dependent of the hypermethylation of a set of given genes then the depletion of this methylation would help to suppress the tumorigenesis by leading to reactivation of the negative feedback of cell growth (Tumor suppressor genes).  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Predeterminado">A promising feature of  epigenetic therapy of cancer is that alterations in the epigenetic state are mitotically heritable; for example in the case of drugs that influence the DNA methylation, the induced changes are maintain through mitosis due to DNA methyltransferase 1 enzyme which keeps the methylation profile from cell to cell during replication, reassuring in this way that endurable effects will be seen at least in already differentiated tissues (theorically the effect will last all the cell´s cycles that a given tissue experiment until death).  However there are defined periods of time (during primordial germ cell development and early development) where a reprogramming of some of the epigenetic marks takes place; the epigenetic marks need to be cleared to restore totipotency for normal development. Environment can have a profound impact in epigenetic control during these sensitive periods and therefore are quite vulnerable for disruption; the use of DNA methylation drugs during these intervals could cause the abnormal reprogramming of certain regions of DNA (imprinted genes and genome derived from paternal and maternal DNA). The abnormal methylation setting would lead to aberrant patterns of expression favoring the emergence of imprinted disorders (beckwith-wiedemann syndrome) or uncertain embryonic malformations. </p></div>
