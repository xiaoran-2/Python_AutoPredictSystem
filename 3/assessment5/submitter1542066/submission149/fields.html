    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p> The normal purpose of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the  silencing of a genes and providing a barrier to destabilizing elements like transposons.  In cancer there is hyper methylation of tumor suppressor genes, so, tumor supression iis turned off.  This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and the cells that have this hyper -methylation are able to divide more quickly that normal cells that are not hyper methylated.  This hypermethylatiion at tumor supressor genes increases over time.  Although in itself this does not cause cancer, it is one of the "hits" that contributes to cancer.  Multiple tumor suppressor genes or alleles of tumor suppressors must be hyper methylated to start tumorgenesis.</p>
<p>Another epigenetic hallmark of cancer is the hypo methylation intergenic and repetitive gene regions. This hypo methylation in the whole genome  tends to destabilize the genome by allowing parasitic transposons to insert themselves into genes disrupting the function of whatever genetic elements they have interfered with.   Hypomethylation at repetitive sequences Also cause genetic instability by allowing themrepeats to actively copy.  There is illegitamate recombinations  aand transpositions which theninterfere with neighboring genes.  Loss of methylation of intergenie regions is the result of the loss of function of DNA methyltransferases specifically, the maintenance  molecule DNMT1.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is an imprinted gene.  The allele is silenced from the maternal side and transcribed from the paternal side.   There is an imprinted control region upstream from the Igf2 gene that is methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated from the maternal allele.  In this case methylation doesn't have the silencing effect.  The unmethylated  maternal allele becomes bound with CTCF a protein complex that blocks the action of the enhancers of the igf2 gene upstream.  Instead the enhancers act  on the H19 gene Which codes for a long non coding RNA.  In the paternal allele the imprinting control region is methylated and the action of the upstream enhancers acts on the Igf2 gene itself because the DNA loops around and that is the region it prefers.  Igf2 Is a growth promoting gene.  In cancer  and Wilm's disease both imprint control regions are methylated and so the enhancer regions upstream act on both copies of the Igf2 gene.  There is a double dose of the growth promoting gene igf2.  In Wilm's disease this causes a childhood kidney tumor, in a cancer it would be another growth promoting gene which would act in concert with other gene changes to cause tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analog in that it gets incorporated into the DNA strand when the cell is replicating.  When the DNMT1 comes along and binds to that particular sequence, it gets stuck and cannot pull away.  This category of drug targets the enzymatic class of epigenetic regulators.  Because it targets dividing cells it acts selectively upon rapidly dividing cells like those in cancer.   In Myelodysplastic syndrome* and tumor supressor gene becomes highly methylated and silences it's tumor supressing activity, the drug Decitabine would reverse this aberrant epigenetic mark.  Even though, something that inhibits DNMT1 would act throughout the patient's system, for some unknown reason this drug seems to work well for MDS patients.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period in a person's  developement would be when their germ cells or somatic cells are still undergoing changes in their epigenetic developement.  In Barker's hypothesis; the  most sensitive time periods were the 1000 days in utero and the first two years of life.  This is when primordial germ cells are being formed and undergoing maturation.  Epigenetic markers are being laid down that not only affect the current generation, but also generations yet to be born.  In studies regarding the Agouti viable yellow strain of mouse, supplementation of diet with methyl donors affected genetically identical strains of mice such that those mice that had been in utero during supplementation had were more likely to be born pseudo agouti and this in turn also affected their long term health (propensity to obesity and diabetes).  In people, smoking and diet during primordial germ cell developement (ages 8-10 years in females and 9-12 years in males) affected generations yet to be born,  in propensity to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
<p>Obviously, if a child canot survive the cancer without treatment then, the treatment must go forward but with the caviat that the child's eggs or sperm may be compromised and a donor may have to be utilised if they are to have children in the future.</p></div>
