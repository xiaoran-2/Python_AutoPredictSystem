    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>a)DNA methylation is carried out by DNA methyl transferases whose function is to methylate cytosine before guanine and in turn leads to silencing of the expression of that gene.</li>
</ol><p>  b) In cancer there is aberrant DNA methylation of CpG islands which arises due to either genetic mutations and/or epigenetic alterations in DNMTs leading to disruption. There is hypomethylation of CpG islands at the promoter of oncogenes, intergenic regions and transposons methylation at CpG islands get demethylated and expressed due to over expression of DNA demethylating enzymes while the CpG islands of tumor suppressor specific gene are hypermethylated (methylation at promoter region).</p>
<p>c) Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to genomic instability which in turn leads to transformation of cells and tumor develoment. For ex. hypomethylation due to deletion of DNMT1 in specific tissues and mutations in DNMT3B result in genomic instability contributing to disease. </p>
<p>d) The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and to to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoter and prevent illegitimate recombination in turn maintain genomic integrity.</p>
<p>e) In cancer, since there is genome wide hypomethylation, there is aberrant over expression of transposable  elements like LINE and SINE.</p>
<p>f) Since there is genome wide hypomethylation which causes various mutations and rearrangements leading to cancer and other related diseases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>2.a) The methylation pattern on paternal allele is that the imprinting control region (ICR) which is located immediately upstream of the neighbouring <em>H19</em> gene and downstream to Igf2 gene. As ICR contains four methylation-sensitive CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding-sites mediating the assembly of a chromatin insulator that blocks interactions between the <em>Igf2</em> promoter and enhancers downstream of the <em>H19</em> gene. Methylation at ICR causes CTCF to not to bind it. So the enhancers activate Igf2 expresssion as there is no binding of CTCF to insulate it and methylate H19 gene.</p>
<p>b) The methylation pattern on maternal allele is that because of unmethylation at ICR, CTCF bind to it. So the enhancers which are downstream to H19 gene activate H19 gene expression and are insulated to bind Igf2 leading to the repression of Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>c) In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of ICR in maternal allele also resulting in the expression of Igf2 from maternal allele also and which in turn leads to over-expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>d)Igf2 express only from paternal allele while disrupting its imprinting by hypermethylating ICR in maternal allele leads to over-expression of growth promoting factors in turns contributes to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>3.</p>
<p>a) Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine<strong> </strong>is a cytidine analogue like azacytidine it works as a DNA-demethylating agent. So it is grouped under a demethylating class.</p>
<p>b) Decitabine acts only on DNA by mechanistically inhibiting DNMTs. Decitabine passively dilutes DNA methylation marks globally and this is dependent on cell division in contrast to active DNA demethylation rendered by TET enzymes.</p>
<p>c) Decitabine can act as anti tumour drug. As this drug either alone or more effectively in combination with histone -deacetylase inhibitors causes global hypomethylation and re-express tumor suppressor genes. This effect can also re-activate methylated transposons.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>4.</p>
<p>a) DNA methylation decides whether the gene will be active or repress. </p>
<p>b) Sensitive period is the period during which the epigenetic reprogramming occur.</p>
<p>c) Sensitive periods of development are early development i.e pre-implantation period and PGC development.</p>
<p>d) Because during this period the patients are setting up there specific marks and how they react is unknown.</p></div>
