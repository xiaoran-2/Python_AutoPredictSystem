    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression and maintain genomic stability. Usually the CpG islands are unmethylated. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In cancer the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted. The CpG islands will be (hyper)methylated. This causes loss of imprinting and genomic instability.</p>
<p>When the DNA methylation is disrupted at CpG islands it will contribute to disease because genes that should be expressed are now silenced. In cancer the hypermethylation of histones at the CpG island will cause tumour-surpressors to be silenced and this causes growth of tumours.  </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In intergenic regions it silences DNMT1 null cells that display genomic instability and also silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.The silencing of repeats prevents transposition, mutation and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. The methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements will be hypomethylated (unmethylated). The factors that are usually silenced to maintain genomic stability will now be expressed. Causing deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations within the karyotype. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to disease because it causes genomic instability which can cause different types of cancers in humans.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated and it will be unmethylated on the maternal allele. CTCF will be able to bind on the maternal imprint control region and this silences the expression of Igf2, the enhancers will express H19. In the paternal allele CTCF can not bind to the imprint control region due to the methylation. The enhancers will express Igf2 and H19 is not expressed. <br />In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation. This causes methylation on the imprint control region at the maternal allele aswell which causes expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele. Igf2 is double expressed and H19 is not expressed. Igf2 is growth promoting and will cause tumours when double expressed. <br />The growth promoting Igf2 needs to be properly expressed. Too little or too much expression of Igf2 will cause disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The altering of DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the changes will be maintained through cell division. It is not advisable to use these medications during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming. These occur in humans pre and after birth. They occur pre-birth in the early development and primordial germ cell development. After birth in the first two years and for boys between 9-12 years of age and for girls between 8-10 years of age. Alterations or removal of the normal epigeetic reprogramming process result in epigenetic abnormalities, and therefore genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, a DNMT inhibitor. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.<br />Decitabine causes the removal of methylation. Decitabine will get incorporated into the DNA upon replication. The DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it. Then DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand. That DNA methyltransferase can no longer be released. This action depends on replication of the cell. This means that cancer cells, that replicate more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more affected and the tumour will get smaller.  <br /><br /></p></div>
