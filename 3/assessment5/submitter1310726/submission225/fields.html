    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG Islands are usually not methylated. Cancer cells in contrast tend to have CpG islands that are hypermethylated. CpG Islands are mostly present in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, genes that suppress growth. Due to the hypermethylation, which is a silencing mark, tumor suppressor genes are silenced. For a cell to be cancerous, multiple tumor suppressor genes need to be suppressed and oncogenes need to be activated. Thus silencing of tumor suppressor genes due to hypermethylation at CpG Islands can be one of the hits needed to cause cancer(Knudson's hypothesis).</p>
<p>In normal cells the repetitive regions and the intergenic regions are usually methylated. But in Cancer cells these regions are usually hypomethylated. Repetitive regions and intergenic regions can provide identical nucleotide sequences for illegitimate recombination to occur. But this illegitimate recombination is prevented in normal cells by methylation and heterochromatinization of the repetitive regions. In cancer cells, due to hypomethylation, these regions are active, resulting in illegitimate recombination, translocation, insertion and deletion. This can also result in transcription of the repeats and activation of cryptic promoters that can disrupt functionality of other necessary genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the H19/Igf2 cluster is usually paternally imprinted, that is, the paternal allele of the imprint control region is usually methylated. Due to methylation, the enhancer blocking element CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 is expressed. On the other hand, the maternal alleles imprint control region is not methylated, thus CTCF binds to the ICR. As a result, CTCF blocks the enhancer molecules from promoting expression of Igf2, instead they promote expression of H19. Thus in maternal allele Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumour, The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated, that is both the paternal and maternal alleles ICR is methylated. This results in the expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Overexpression of Igf2 , which is a growth promoter(oncogene), leads to tumorigenesis in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that acts to inhibit DNA methylation. So this drug belongs to the class DNA methyl transferase inhibitors or DNMTi or DNA demythylating agent. When Decitabine is applied, these drug molecules get incorporated into the DNA, being analogous to the nucleosides, They bind to DNA methyl transferases following replication. But in this case, the binding is irreversible. Thus in tumor cells, when the cells are excessively replicating, the cells are more severely affected by Decitabine, they are not methylated and hence the cell cannot become cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore it usually have persisting effects. Moreover, most of the epigenetic changes are transferred to next generations unless these marks are actively erased in sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are time periods in development when the epigenetic marks are usually erased and new marks are set up. These periods, in humans are usually considered as the early-embryonic development and the primordial germ cell development periods. During these periods the epigenetic machinery are usually used to set up epigenetic marks. So treating patients during these periods, for example a yong adult with developing germ cells, with epigenetic drugs may disrupt the functionality of the machinery and have long term adverse effects on the individual. that's why the patients undergoing sensitive periods should be kept off of these drugs.</p></div>
