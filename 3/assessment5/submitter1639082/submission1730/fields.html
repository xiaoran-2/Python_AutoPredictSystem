    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA is a covalent modification that affects gene expression through various mechanisms. Methylation of CpG islands is usually at low levels in healthy cells and when it occurs it contributes to gene silencing, for instance in the case of imprinted genes. In case of cancer, methlyation of CpG islands is increased, mainly in the vicinity of tumor supressor genes, thereby these gene products are not present at sufficient levels to exert their protective function against tumorgenesis. Also, increased methylation at the shores of CpG islands results in misexpression of genes allowing the tumor to gain adaptive features for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, CpG methylation can result in loss of imprinting, for instance leading to overexpression of Igf2, thus leading to increased cell growth.</p>
<p>Constitutive methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is essential for the normal development and life of a cell. These processes repress transposable elements (thereby guarding genome stability) and also contribute to silencing of criptic splice sites, alternative promoters which would otherwise lead to misexpression of genes. In case of cancer cells, such regions tend to be hypomethylated and thereby lead to an abnormal transcriptome and an instable genome that is helpful for the development of a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 locus is an imprinted region of the genome, the hypermethylation of its ICR leads to gene misexpression resulting in a particular tumor type, the Wilm’s tumor. In case of the paternal allele, normally, the promoter of H19 is silenced (through methylation) along with its ICR that is therefore can not be bound by CTCF. This results in steric accessibility of enhacers to the Igf2 gene, which is thus being expressed from the paternal allele. In case of the maternal copy, the ICR (and the H19 promoter) is not methylated, H19 is expressed, the ICR is bound by CTCF and thus the enhancers cannot drive the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In case of Wilm’s tumor, both paternal and maternal alleles are methylated thereby the H19 expression is abolished and the Igf2 expression increaes by twofold (CTCF is not bound and the enhancers exert their function). As the Igf2 gene is growth promoting, it leads to overproliferation of tissue (childhood kidney) and tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that exerts its function via decreasing DNA methylation of a cell, thus it belongs to the class of DNA demethylating agents. The big advantage of treating the epigenetic changes in cancer cells, that these (as opposed to genetic mutations) can be reversed and this reversed state is inherited mitotically. Desirably, Decitabine would work in a way that it could erease the methlyation from hypermethylated CpG islands of tumorsupressor genes, therby resulting in their re-expression. Also, such epigenetic drugs could hopefully make cancer cells more vulnerable to standard chemotherapy, furthermore in case if the malicious epigenetic changes of a tumor could be deleted, in theory it would stop the „tumor behaviour” of the clone. Thereby the cells would not need to be killed but they would not be further deletorious to the body, but rather „tamed”.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore if a drug changes the methylation status of a cell, this can be further inherited and maintained in the progeny of the cell. Sensitive periods of development in regards to artificially altering DNA methlyation are those periods, when the methylation status of cells is undergoing changes in normal development. Such stages are the early embryonic development (preimplantation period), when in the zygote and in the freshly dividing blastomeres the DNA demethylation (active and inactive) is occuring. Also, the period when germ cell development occurs is sensitive to such disturbance. If interference with DNA methylation occurs in such periods, the drug can have an effect not only on the patient but also on the progeny of the patient, which could lead to abnormalities. Therefore, the use of such drugs should be avioded in such periods.</p></div>
