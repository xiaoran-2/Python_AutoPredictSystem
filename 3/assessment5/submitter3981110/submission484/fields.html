    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters  and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development in which gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing of the underlying gene that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Cancer cell is able to inactivate the tumor suppressor genes by silencing it and DNA methylation is a very good locking dowm mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing The genome in normal cell in general is methylated including <span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In contrast,<span>intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cell is hypomethylated. Hypomethylation in the genome or genome-wide hypomethylation causes genomic instability which has the consequences of Illegitimate recombination between repeats. This repeats has the capacity to make copies of themselves and jump around the genome which could result in disrupting the coding region of  genes and activate the neighboring genes. </span></span>Also, the increased karyotypic instability and activation of tumor-promoting genes by <em>cis</em> or <em>trans</em> effects might  altered heterochromatin-euchromatin interactions and may be important consequences of DNA hypomethylation which favor oncogenesis</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal imprint control region is methylated and unmethylated in maternal allele. while umethylated, the CTCF will bind and enable the enhancer to act on H19 but Igf2 will be silenced from maternal allele. However on paternal allele the enhancer can act on on Igf2 because CTCF is not binding and Igf2 will be expressed. However, in cancer with loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth which is associated with <span>Wilm’s tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belong to a class of epigentic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors .<span>Decitabine exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals during development and it is becoming increasingly apparent that drugs can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after the period of treatment. <span>acute exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters which will <span>adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued. The sensitive period is the period of fetal congnitive development and trating patient with a drug that alter DNA methylation can result to <span>neurological and cognitive disorders.</span></span></span></span><br /></span></p></div>
