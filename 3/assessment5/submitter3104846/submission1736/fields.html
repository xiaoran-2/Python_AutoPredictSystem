    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in somatic cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, they have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The silencing of a tumor suppressor allows that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the surrounding cells. The cells with this epimutation are more likely to divide more frequently and do not die soon that is why they take over, so it causes the cancer. The CGI methylation varies with cancer type.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The intergenic regions in normal cells are in general methylated, whereas in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. The hypomethylation of repeats causes instability of genome, the consequence of which is illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and their transposition and activation of cryptic promoters, which cause disruption in neighboring genes. That finally results  in genomic instabilities deletion, insertion and reciprocal translocations in chromosomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer cells is that they show loss of imprinting. The genes doesn’t display the imprinted mono allelic expression anymore. They are expressed in either both alleles or silent in both parental alleles. They are possibly involved in growth promoting or growth suppressing in cancer.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the imprint control region of Igf2/H19 cluster is imprinted on the paternal allele and it is unmethylated on maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF binds this element and in this case, the enhancers act on H19, but Igf2 would not show any expression, i.e. silent. As the paternal allele is methylated now, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and in result, it is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Because of decreased imprinting in cancer cell, there is a hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. That causes that maternal allele also have expression of Igf2. Now the Igf2 expression is doubled as compared to the normal cell. The Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>The imprinting is observed in many tissues in early stages of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group DNMT inhibitors, they are DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors. These are used in myelodisplastic syndrome which is progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). They are nucleoside analogues, they get incorporated to the DNA upon replication. When DNA Methyltransferase come to bind the nucleotide, this DNA Methyltransferase binds and cannot be released again, irreversibly.</p>
<p>The action of this DNMT is division dependent. Cancer cells would be more effected because they are dividing more rapidly and replicating more.</p>
<p>In high dosis, the DNMTi, like decitabine have very toxi effect and does not help in cancer treatment. But in lower dosis, it causes DNA demethylation, which has an anti-neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>A newly developed inhibitor, name GSK2816126, dramatically declined the amount of histone overmethylation in treated cancer cells. It also reduces the proliferation of tumor cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is when the environment is able to influence the epigenetic make up. The sensitive periods for epigenetic development are; the period of development of mature eggs/sperms from primordial germ cells and the period of pre-implantation and early post-implantation. They are periods of active remodeling of epigenome and are most sensitive to the change in environment.</p>
<p>The epigenetic drugs have the potential to effect throughout the system. That is why the patients that are in the phase of germ cell development or in sensitive period of epigenetic development, can have a large environmental effect on the whole epigenetic make up. So, it is not advisable to treat such patients.</p></div>
