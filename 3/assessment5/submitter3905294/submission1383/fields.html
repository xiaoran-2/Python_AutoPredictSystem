    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands seems to be inactivation of promoters that contain these CpGs by binding MeCP1 &amp; MeCP2 proteins which induces condensation and inhibits transcription. however, in cancer the DNA methylation at CpG islands seems to be increased with tumor progression. CpG hypermethylathion tends to occur at specific genes, usually tumor suppressor genes and contribute to their inactivation which can be one of the hits that eventually lead to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements also has a downregulationg function to decrease purposeless transcription of these elements, it also keeps genetic stability by preventing deletetions and other alteration to chromosomes. in cancer this overall methylation that is not at CpG islands is decreased (hypomethylation) and this mostly happens at the intergenic regions and repeats.</p>
<p>this hypomethylation is associated with carcinogenensis and tumor progression as well as metastasis. Hypomethylation in cancer increases the frequency of chromosome alterations and deletions, and increase the frequence of transposons jumping in the genome and activating or inactivating other genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele: ICR is methylated, CTCF can't bind and the enhancers act on Igf2 leading to its expression.</p>
<p>Maternal allele: ICR is not methylated which allows binding of CTCF which blocks the enhancers from Igf2 so it's not expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele of H19/Igf2 is hypermethylated which leads to it expressing Igf2 like the patternal allele. So the patient has a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoter and leads to increased tumor growth in Wilm's tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine removes methylation marks from the hypermethylated CpG islands that are found in the promotors of tumour suppressor genes, by restoring the tumour suppressor genes' functions it may restore the cell to being normal or induce its apoptosis, decreasing the tumour size without affecting normal cells much.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable, which means that they are passed on from parent cell to daughter cells in mitosis and they remain there until actively removed, once they are removed they can't be restored which can be why the drugs have a lasting effect.</p>
<p>sensitive periods are periods in development where epigenetic marks are removed from the genome to allow certain phases of development to happen and convert the cells to pluripotent cells, these phases include the early development period of the pre-implantation and post-implantation embrio, and the development of premordial germ cells.</p>
<p>When treating patients (treatment of pregnant mothers affects their embrios) in the sensitive periods with drugs that alter DNA methylation and epigenetic marks, the reprogramming that should follow the sensitive period will be disrupted and these cells will not function normally, which in itself may lead to further DNA instability and tumourgenesis. or even death of that embrio if the epigenetic marks are not properly established.</p></div>
