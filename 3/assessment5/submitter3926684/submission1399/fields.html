    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cells, the CpG islands are commonly unmethylated or hypomethylated, whereas in cancer cells, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. This hypermethylated CpG islands can be found on the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, causing then the silencing of these genes. Once the tumor suppressor genes are no longer being expressed, there is a possibility of this silencing contribute with the evolution of the tumor. There is also the CpG island shores, which can silence the expression of other genes.</p>
<p>In the normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are commonly methylated, whereas in cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This hypomethylation causes damaging in the genomic stability, as illegitimate recombination between repeats (once the chromatin is not densely packaged), activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the Imprint Control Region in the paternal allele is methylated (it’s paternally imprinted). This methylation on the ICR prevents the CTCF protein to bind and enable the enhancers to act in the expression of the Igf2.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, so the CTCF protein insulates the Igf2, enabling the enhancers to act on H19 and enhance its expression. Once the Igf2 is insulated from the enhancers, it is not expressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the Wilm’s tumour there is a hypermethylation on the ICR, where both the maternal and paternal allele show a methylation on the ICR, causing a overexpression of Igf2. This double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting, probably contributes with the tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It works as a nucleoside analogue, binding irreversibly to the DNMTs.  This binding interferes with the methylation of the daughter strand. In the course of the time, what happens is a decrease on the global methylation of the DNA, once the DNMTs are compromised.</p>
<p> As the DNMTs only act on cells that are dividing, the drug is most likely to affect the cancer cells, which are constantly in division. Tumors that are caused for epigenetic hypermethylation  could be “reversed” with the use of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, causing the DNA demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once the methylation pattern is mitotically heritable, any methylation (or lack of it) found in the DNA should pass to the daughter strand. If by a drug you are able to demethylate the DNA, this information would last in the DNA beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are certain periods of development that are susceptible to environmental signals and also periods of epigenetic reprogramming, on which happens the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. As an example of these sensitive periods we have the early development reprogramming and the development of the primordial germ cells. If during this sensitive periods a patient is treated with drugs that alter the DNA methylation, it could cause a huge disruption on the patient’s development. The epigenetic marks would be incorrectly cleared and reset, possibly causing failures in the expression of many genes and therefore in the development. </p></div>
