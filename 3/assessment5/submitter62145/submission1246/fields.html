    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally in cells, little used regions of DNA are “turned off “by methylation at cytosines connected to guanines by a phosphate bond. Where these are clustered into “islands” around promoters, however, CpGs are usually not methylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If CpG islands are methylated, their associated promoters and genes are silenced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells, DNA methylation is often reversed. CpG islands which are normally unmethylated can become methylated. In particular, genes that normally function to suppress tumour growth can become silent, allowing cancer to grow. Any CpG islands which are normally methylated can become unmethylated, and the genes that they control are no longer silenced but are overexpressed instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of the genome is not made of clustered CpG dinucleotides, and tends to become less methylated in cancer. Most often, DNA becomes unmethylated at repetitive elements, normally methylated and heterochromatinized in healthy cells. Unmethylated repetitive elements could interfere with the integrity of the genome through deletions, insertions, or translocations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another place DNA methylation is reversed in adversely affected regions in cancer cells is in intergenic regions downstream of demethylated CpG island promoter regions. Although seemingly far away from the promoters, they have a supporting role, and demethylation here contributes to genomic instability - another insult to the robustness of the cell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seems for repair mechanisms to be overcome and cancer to take hold, not one but many regions must be affected. Epigenetic marks work together, so that for the genome to become unstable, several epigenetic layers have to fail. In cancer, repeats and growth factors are overexpressed and tumour suppressors are silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions can either suppress or promote gene expression. Many imprinted genes are involved in controlling growth, though they have different mechanisms of action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2, for example, is expressed from the paternal allele, where enhancers act on the region where it is encoded. It’s paternally imprinted; its ICR is methylated on the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 is not meant to be expressed from the maternal allele; an insulator protein normally blocks the same enhancers from reaching the maternal Igf2 region. This protein can bind because the maternal ICR is unmethylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene, a growth promoter.  In Wilm’s tumour, a childhood kidney cancer, there are effectively two paternal copies of this gene (uniparental disomy), either from mutations or deletions in this region that lead to loss of imprinting and the maternal allele functioning as an extra paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the same chromosome where Igf2 is expressed, is Cdkn1, a growth inhibitor (tumour suppressor), expressed from the materal allele and silenced from the paternal allele. Often in conjuction with uniparental disomy and overexpression of Igf2 there is also silencing of this nearby Cdkn1 cluster. So not only are affected regions over-producing growth promoters, they are also under-producing growth restrictors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine targets the DNA methyltransferase-1 enzyme, acting in opposition. It is one of a class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. DNMTi’s function is to facilitate DNA methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, DNA is methylated at incorrect sites. When Decitabine molecules are present, they bind to the active site of DNMTi so that the enzyme cannot facilitate the methylation of the cancer cells’ DNA as they divide and copy epigenetic marks from one generation of the replicating genome to the next.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, when the drug is present, it is also able to act against the correct transcription of dividing healthy cells. However, in patients who are not actively growing, but whose healthy cells are dividing very slowly compared to their cancer cells that have heavily methylated CpG islands, the greater proportion of the cells affected by the action of the drug are cancer cells, so treatment with Decitabine has been successful.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If DNA methyltransferase inhibiting epigentic drugs were present during DNA methylation as cells were dividing and attempting to copy over DNA methylation marks to the new daughter chromosomes, we would expect the methylation pattern on the new DNA would be different to the pattern on the DNA it was copied from. There would be less methylation overall on newly copied chromosomes. While this might be favourable in cells from cancer tumours, we would not want it in healthy cells that were proliferating rapidly into more healthy cells, making different tissue types, or germ cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if only one round of cell division were widely affected, it is possible that 50% of the cells in the resultant tissues would have inherited incorrect methylation patterns!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In human development, sensitive periods for laying down epigenetic marks include the first trimester of life, specifically the pre-implantation blastocyst stage, the newborn period, and the first years of prepuberty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We would want to avoid exposing cells to DNA methyltransferase enzyme inhibitors during these sensitive periods, as changes to DNA methylation patterns at these stages could affect the resulting tissues, organs, and germ cells, and thus not only the adult but also their progeny.</p></div>
