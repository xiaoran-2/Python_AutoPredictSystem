    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of methyl groups to Cytosine bases by methyltransferases.  CpG dinucleotides are often as found part of a CpG island which are often located near promoters of genes.  CpG islands are usually protected from methylation allowing expression of nearby genes. However if the CpG island becomes methylated this often leads to the supression of gene expression of nearby genes.  If the nearby gene, which is silenced by methylation is involved (by a variety of methods) in suppresion of cell proliferation, this can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, cancer.</p>
<p>DNA Methylation in Intergenic Repeats act as a stabilising factor for the genome, as they supress so-called cryptic start sites, low levels of transcription of these are often present without pathology however increased transcription of these sites is often associated with cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements also act as a stabilising factor, the silencing of  of the promoters of the GAG and POl proteins means the elements are less likely to transpose or 'jump' and potentially prevent correct expression of tumour supressor genes.  The silencing of the LTR promoter also reduces the unwanted expression of nearby genes due to the strength of the RE promoter. Both of these may contribute to uncontrolled cellular proliferation..</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 is situated on Chromosome 11, and on the paternal allelle the ICR is methylated which prevents the binding of CTCF, and thus allows the spread of methylation to the H19 gene promoter. Conversely on the Maternal allele is unmethylated which allows the binding of CTCF, this in turn insulates Igf2, from the enhancers located downstream, which can then act on enhancing the expression from the H19 gene promoter.<br /><br />Wilm's tumour is a feature of Beckwith Widermann syndrome and results from a loss of expression of tumour suppressing genes, and an upregulation of growth factors, either or both of which can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, ie cancer. This results from the possession of two alleles that resemble the paternal allelle rather than just one, caused by a lack of imprinting, uniparental disomy or non-specific loss of existing imprinting, and so a lack of expression of Cdkn1c occurs and increased expression of Igf2 occurs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a small double ringed DNA-methylation inhibitor compound and thus acts as a epigenetic inhibitor, by preventing DNA methylation. In some types of cancers including lymphomas there is an over-activity of EZH2 (<span>Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase) which leads to hyper-methylation of histones and thus suppression of genes that are involved in tumour suppression. Since abrogating this activity, and allowing normal (ie lower) levels of methylation, would allow expression of tumour supressor genes DNA-demethylation compounds show promise as drug candidates, and as these changes would be mitotically heritable, once changed they wouldnt return.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be a heritable change, and thus once imprinting is altered, it can remain altered and maintained by the body. A sensitive period is a time when there is potential clearing and re-imprinting of genes allowing an easier change in the 'normal' level of imprinting.</p>
<p>Senstive time periods of development,  include germ cell development ,embryogenesis and when there is neuronal plasticity in the brain in development from child to adult</p>
<p>There is concern regarding the effects of epigenetic drugs on germ cell development so treating younger patients should be treated with caution, as would women of child bearing age, not using an effective method of contraception, as the drugs could potentially affect the DNA methylation levels ie imprinting of a unknown developng pregnancy.</p></div>
