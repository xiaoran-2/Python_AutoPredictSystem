    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CPG islands is a type of locus specific DNA hypermethylation. And methylation at CPG islands leads to transcriptional silencing that is mitotically heritable.Hence,CPG methylation is a tumor suppresor gene silencer in cancer. Since CPG islands are found in the promoter of tumor suppresor genes,it could be the second or one of the hits that occurs in the Knudson hypothesis that states cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. owing to the fact CPG islands methylation is mitotically heritable,it then leads to silencing of tumor suppresor genes. Genomic stability is maintained through intergenic and repetitive elements methylation. Which means no gain or loss of chromosomes occur or recombination between them. When this stability is lost,it leads to illegimate recombination between repeats,activation of repeats and transpostion and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Consequently,deletions,insertions and reciprocal translocation are most likely to occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to JQ1 inhibitor class of drugs that is used in treating cancer epigenetically. Its cancer therapeutic power is through the process of inhibitng BRD4,which is an epigenetic regulator,the inhibition of BRD4 blocks the activity of myc,which is a gene that is responsible for encoding a protein called the transcription factor. The malfunctioning of this transcription factor is a common cause of cancer because it particpates in the expression of fifteen percent of human gene. Decitabine and azacitidine are DNA-methylating agents used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes,the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic therapies can affect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to destroy all its cells and these therapies last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic are passed on mitotically to daughters and granddaughters. One would avoid treating patients epigentically during sensitive period as this is the period of development when the environment has the biggest influence our genetic makeup,hence the epigenome is actively remodeled. And this period includes;primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm and pre-implantation and post implantation period. At these periods,somatic maintenance is not obtainable hence,any medication taken at this period would not be sustained across generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. And hypermethylation is not just exclusive of imprint control regions incancer which means hypomethylation regions could also be found. The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. CTCF 4 bind is the insulator element when it's unmethylated which translates that the enhancers will act on H19 while igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele hence,there won't be any expression while the opposite is the case for the paternal allele because the enhancers can act on igf2 since CTCF is not binded to insulate the imprint control hence,igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. Hypermethylation of the imprint control region results because of loss of imprinting on the maternal allel as well which would lead to igf2 wxpression hence,double dose igf2.  Consequently,this results to Wilm's tumor since igf2 is growth promoting. Wilm's tumor is a type of kidney cancer that affect children typically. And it is a rare form of cancer.</p></div>
