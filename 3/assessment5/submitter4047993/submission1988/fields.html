    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation at CpG islands takes place so as to silence a particular gene i.e example of X inactivation out of the two chromosomes. In case of cancer the Dna methylation causes silencing for the supression of those genes due to which the inactivation doesn't take place.In case of X inactivation,  if one of the X chromosomes in females doesn't get inactivated then it may result to super females. Thus these diseases take place because DNA methylation doesnt take place.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors of DNMTi(DNA methyl transferases inhibitor).It is used for myelodysplastic syndrome progressing to AML.Since DNMTis are nucleoside analogues so that when replication occurs they are incorporated into DNA and when DNMTs come and bind to it to copy the methylation to the daughter strand then that DNMT is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. This shows that they are replication dependent and hence will affect cancer cells to the maximum.Thus they lead to demethylation.</p></div>
