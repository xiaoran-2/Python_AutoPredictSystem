    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of DNA in mammals almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides. Due to its symmetry it can be maintained through cell division. CpGs are often found clustered into CpG islands at promotors of genes. They tend to be protected from methylation, but if there is a methylation at a CpG island, the gene expression is silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer the CpG islands are more likely methylated (CpG island hypermethylation). In general the methylation is at tumor suppressor genes, silencing them. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it’s a very effective way to silence a tumor suppressor gene. Silencing a tumor suppressor gives the cells a competitive advantage over the other cells in that tissue. Over a period of time it’s more likely that they divide more rapidly or not die as much. The CpG-island methylation progresses with time and gets more the more while the tumor is progressing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The function of this methylation could be to maintain genomic integrity. Without the methylation at integenic regions abnormal karyotypes could occur, like chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. The methylation of intergenic regions also silence cryptic transcription start sides or cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also to maintain genomic integrity. They are silenced to prevent transposition, or to prevent mutations of the repeats to prevent transposition.  They are silenced to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promotors and the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions tent to be unmethylated (hypomethylated). This leads to genomic instability like chromosome deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations because of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is on the human chromosome 11. The imprinted control region is unmethylated on the maternal allel. In its unmethylated form it can be bound by CTCF, an insulator protein. It insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. These are now free to enhance the expression of H19.</p>
<p>The imprinted control region is methylated on the paternal allel. That means that the H19/lgf2 is paternally imprinted. CTCF cannot bind to the imprinted control region when it is methylated. In this case the enhancers are free to bind Igf2 and enhance its expression. H19 is methylated too, due to hetrochromatin spreading and therefore silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor, a child kidney tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated. The maternal allel is now methylated too, resulting in Igf2 expression from both allels.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene. It promotes growth. When it is overexpressed the cells have an unnatural growth leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a drug agains DNA-methyltransferases DNMT, inhibiting them.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine are all nucleoside analogues. They are incorporated into the DNA and bind irreversibly to DNMTs during replication. Because of the dependency for replication for the inhibitors to have an effect, cancer cells are more severely affected because they are dividing more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotic heritable. Because of this all cells in a tissue can maintain cell identity and tissue homogeneity. Drugs that alter the DNA methylation, alter it not only in the affected cells, but also in the following generations of this cell.</p>
<p>This Heritability is countered by periods when epigenetic marks are removed. This periods are called sensitive periods.  In this time the environment can chance the epigenetic. Sensitive periods are during the epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells and in the early development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods (during germ cell development) this could have severe effects for his or her future children.</p></div>
