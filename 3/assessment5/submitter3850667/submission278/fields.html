    <h1>Submission 278 from Anon (session_user_id: e2e9bf383847d982d382a501089489c04acaf137)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands is frequently found in tumours, often in the area of tumour suppressor genes. This would silence the tumour suppressor, which would not allow it to carry out its tumour suppressing activity, therefore promoting tumour growth.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a drug which demethylates DNA, by acting as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and is used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. As a demethylating drug, it would act by reducing the hypermethylation in CpG islands which is one of the epigenetic characteristics of cancer. This would permit the expression of the tumour supressor genes which would possibly slow the growth of any tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">DNA methylation is associated with repression. When it is found in CpG islands, it generally results in gene silencing. It is not common to find DNA methylation in CpG islands as these areas are protected from methylation. An example of areas of methylated CpG islands would be the inactive X chromosome.</div>
<div dir="ltr">A characteristic of some types of cancer is hypermethylation of the CpG islands in a certain set of genes. These cancers are called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) cancers. Expression of growth restriction genes can be a result of the methylation of CpG islands at gene promoters, which can lead to the growth of a tumour.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. The function of DNA methylation in these regions is to maintain genomic integrity. It does this by:</p>
<ul><li>silencing repeats which avoids transposition and transcriptional interference</li>
<li>preventing inadequate recombination</li>
<li>avoiding transposition by mutating repeats from methylated cytosine to thymine</li>
</ul><p>Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted at some level in all tumours. Hypomethylation of these regions can lead to genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, disruption of local genes and activation of promoters which are normally inactive, leading to many types of cancer.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal. CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR (the maternal one), so that the enhancers act on H19 and IGF2 is silent. On the paternal allele (which is methylated), the enhancers act on IGF2 which is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, a cancer of the kidney which occurs in children, the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on both the maternal and the paternal alleles, thus activating expression of both IGF2. This would double the dose of the growth promoter Igf2 in the cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is passed down after cell division to the daughter cells. This means that unless DNA methylation is actively removed, it will continue in the epigenome indefinitely.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a brief window of time when DNA methylation is removed and therefore the genome is susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming. There are two sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming; one is during germ cell development and the other is during early development. Treating patients that are within a sensitive period, for example a younger patient who has developing germ cells could be detrimental for their offspring, as their epigenome could be negatively affected by the treatment. </p></div>
