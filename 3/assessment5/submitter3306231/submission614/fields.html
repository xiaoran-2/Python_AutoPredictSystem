    <div class="field-value"><p>The metylation means adding the methyl group to DNA nucleotide cytosine. This happens at CpG dinucleotide pair ( cytosine followed by guanosine).</p>
<p>There are many CpG dinucleotides at specific regions of the genomes  called CpG islands.</p>
<p>The CpG islands are generally at the sites of the promoters of the genes.  Methylation of the CpG islands make the gene not to be expressed/silenced. Normal cells have CpG islands not methylated to allow transcription factors to bind and keep important genes ,like tumour suppressor genes , to be active.</p>
<p>Tumour cells show inverted methylation profile which means CpG islands are hipermethylated. Hipermethylation of gene promoters can results in silencing of those genes. This epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate proliferation of the cells are silenced allowing cells to reproduce without control leading to cancer.</p>
<p>There are different clusters of hipermethylated CpG islands specific for different cancers. This feature can be use for tumours diagnosis.</p>
<p>The level of hypermethylation can be used as prognostic factor for example high level for methylation is poor prognostiof factor for lung cancer but CIMP type of colorectal cancer indicates favourable prognosis.</p>
<p>The regions adjacent to CpG island in cancer can be also hipermethylated (islands shores) and this feature can be a prognostic factor for cancer patients ( probably better indicator of genes expression).</p>
<p>In normal  cells the parts of the genome like intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to  protect gene stability. Again  cancer cells show inverted pattern which means hypomethylation of those regions which leads to chromosome instability and mutations.</p>
<p>All cancers show global hypometylation of genome causing genes instability and hypermethylation of the CpG islands causing silencing of the tumour suppresor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting means that small number of our genes (150 for humans) escape from epigenetic reprogramming in early embryo stage. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.</p>
<p>For most of the genes we inherit two working copies, one maternal and one paternal. With imprinted genes we inherit only one working copy and one is epigenetically silenced.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are very sensitive to genetic or epigenetic mutations. Any changes can lead to disease like for example in  Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome. Imprinted gene abnormalities in so called H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11 are responsible for this syndrome. The Igf2 gene codes for a hormone that stimulates growth. For healthy children the maternal allele imprint control region is unmethylated but leading to not active Igf2 gene and paternal allele imprint control region is methylated  leading to active Igf2.</p>
<p>Epimutation or mutation of H19/Igf2 cluster may lead to loss of imprinting ( hypermethylation of the maternal  imprint control region) and two active Igf2 genes with subsequent double dose of promoting growth Igf2 hormone which gives baby overgrowth and increased risk of cancer during the childhood for example kidney tumour called Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Mutations are not reversible but epimutations which means epigenetic tags like methylation are reversible. The enzyme DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT) is responsible for methylation process. If we have the drug which may inhibit DNMT we may stop methylation and reverse suppression of tumour suppressor genes and stop the cancer growth.</p>
<p>This kind of inhibitor of DNA methylation exists and is called decitabone. This is DNA nucleotide analog which irreversibly binds DNMT and is replication dependent. This means that dividing cells show less methylation due to inactive DNMT. Cancer cells divide more rapidly then any other cells so are affected more by this drug then normal tissue. The hypometylation of the CpG islands induced by decitabine results in reactivation of tumour supressor genes and suppression of tumour growth.</p>
<p>Epigenetic therapy with hypomethylations drugs is now standard of care in myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that methylation is a crusial process for life.</p>
<p>We do not know all the consequences of the drugs which inhibit DNMT. The  process induced by DNMT inhibitors is irreversible and affects all the tissues, not only only the cancer cells. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled which happens during preimplantation embryo development and germ cells development. During those sensitive periods drugs factors may severely effect the genome.</p>
<p>That's why DNMT inhibitors are not suitable for pregnant patients.</p>
<p> Using the drug during those sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogamming would restrict remethylation process leading to fetal death/future generation mutations.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors are not suitable for younger patients as we do not know long term consequences of the demethylation process for non-cancer tissues.</p>
<p>For old cancer patients epigenetic drugs in low doses are very promising.</p></div>
