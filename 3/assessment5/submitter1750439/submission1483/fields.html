    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Proper CpG island methylation is important for cell differentiation and epigenetic regulation, lack of methylation in these regions is important for imprinting, genetic stability.In cancer there is heavy CpG Island hypermethylaton and hypermethylation of CpG island shores (2kb region around CpG island). Hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores can affect expression of tumour suppressor genes, may also contribute to genome instability and drive genetic mutations. In cancer there is evidence of hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leading to genomic instability and possible further development of genetic mutations, reciprocal translocations and insertions. Due to CpG island poor methylation, there may also be activation of oncogenes, e.g R-Ras in gastric cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster represents a region on chromosome 11 , in  which genomic imprinting occurs resulting in the the IGF2 gene inherited from the father being active and the maternal allele inactive. Loss of imprinting can be due to either hypermethylation or hypomethylation, In the normal paternal allele, hypermethyltion of the imprint control region (ICR) leads to binding of enhances and expression of Igf2, In the matenal allele, lack of methylation at the ICR leads to expression of H19 long non coding RNA and inhibition of binding of enhancers , resulting in no expression of igf2.  Hypermethylation of the maternal allelle Leads to loss of restriction on growth promoting genes, over expression of growth promoting genes. In wilms tumor there is hypermethylation of the ICR resulting in over expression of IGF</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine results in hypomethylation of the epigenome, Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine works by acting as a nucleoside analogue, i.e it is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during replication. When the DNA methyltransferase binds to the incorporated analogue there is an irreversible binding reaction which inhibits the ability of the enzyme to methylate , ultimately leading to a loss of hypermethylation. In particular this leads to a loss of hypermethylation of tumour suppressive gene promotors. A hallmark of haematological malignancies is hypermethlation of tumour suppressor gene and loss of their function. The anti-tumour effect of decitabine is to remove this loss of function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is meitotically inheritable and the effects these drugs are having on the epigenome will be passed onto daughter and subsequent grand daughter cells until these epigenetic marks are erased. A sensitive period refers to periods during development when epigenrtic marks are removed , these periods of embryonic stem cell (ESC) development and primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Epigenetic control is critical for all cell types,drugs which target DNA methylation may inhbit DNA methylation in all of the tissues, resulting in side effects and downstream consequences. In particular during sensitive periods, the use of these drugs may affect ESC development and subsequent formation of appropriate tissue and organs, their effects on PGC, may affect epigenetic imprinting and proper maternal or paternal inheritance of active genes.</p></div>
