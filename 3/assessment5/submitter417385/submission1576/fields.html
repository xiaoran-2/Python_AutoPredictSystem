    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, often nearby or at promoters of genes, are originally unmethylated in normal healthy cells.  Their methylation blocks accessibility of the nearby promoter, therefore, these islands are protected to avoid gene silencing.  In cancer cells, CpG islands and shores, are more likely to be methylated, a feature called CpG island hypermethylation (CGIs).  CGIs occurring at tumor suppressor genes or at imprinted genes result in loss of growth control and lead to tumor development or appearance of other diseases.  CGIs expand to nearby shores up to 2kb in length.  This can lead to the inactivation of important genes and adds up to the causes of new diseases.  <br /><br /> DNA methylation is important in genomic stability. It prevents transposable elements from jumping around freely in the genome, it prevents illegitimate recombination and silences the repeats to prevent transcriptional interference.  Cancer cells suffer from genome-wide DNA hypomethylation that affects repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs.  Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions causes a shift from heterocromatic DNA to euchromatic DNA.  The accessibility of euchromatic DNA can create the alignment of similar repetitive regions from non-homologous areas and lead to their posterior recombination.  These illegitimate recombinations can lead to chromosomal deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in cellular division processes, contributing to the appearance of different diseases.  Also, hypomethylation activates cryptic promoters and therefore the transcription of possibly aberrant DNA.  It also completely alters the imprinting machinery, destabilizing the paternal and maternal imprinting of genes.       </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The mechanism of action of the imprint control region (ICR) at the H19/Igf2 cluster is known as enhancer blocking.  Downstream enhancers bind to the promoter regions to induce gene expression.  CTCF is an insulator protein that when bond to the ICR, prevents enhancers from inducing Igf2 transcription.  H19, on the other hand is then accessible to the enhancers.<br /><br /> In the presence of methylation, ICR and the nearby H19 promoter are both silenced.  CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and the H19 promoter is inactive.  Igf2 becomes free for enhancers to act upon. </p>
<p>Healthy cells show paternal allele methylation, expressing H19, and non-methylated maternal allele, expressing Igf2.  <br /><br /> In Wilm’s tumor, hypermethylation of the maternal ICR and H19 promotor region lead to the expression of Igf2 in the mother as well as the in the father.  Both promoters are therefore expressed and imprinting of the alleles is lost.  <br /><br /> Lots of genes involved in imprinting are involved in growth promoting of growth suppressing.  Igf2 and H19 regulate each other when it comes to growth stimulation.  Loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of growth promoting genes that can lead to uncontrolled growth and therefore disease.     </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a DNA demethylating agent sold as Dacogen®.  It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  <br /><br /> Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which in cancer precursor cells is highly active, producing the DNA hypermethylation which leads to ICR hypermethylation and CpG island hypermethylation.  DNA hypermethylation alters genetic imprinting and also results in loss of tumor suppressing gene expression.  When these suppressor genes are blocked, cell division is no longer regulated and can go out of control.  Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, exerting a control on its DNA hypermethylation activity.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is laid down by de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals) and is maintained throughout cell division (by DNMT1).  Since it is mitotically heritable, any alterations that are produced at a given cell will be inherited throughout that cell’s lineage.  This could be hours, days, or a lifetime.  If important genes are affected by these alterations, the affected cells may go out of control and proliferate widely.  Epigenetic drugs reduce out of control proliferation, controlling therefore, tumor malignancy.  Once a tumor is no longer malignant, response to targeted chemo and radiotherapy is increased.  The use of epigenetic drugs will avoid cancerous cells from deploying more heritable hypermethylated regions to their lineages.  <br /><br /> However, the use of these drugs is not advisable to be used at certain points in a lifetime.  There are periods of epigenetic reprogramming that could be severely affected by the use of these drugs.  The two waves of reprogramming occur at primordial germ cell development and early development.  Treatment during these periods would alter the imprinting of genes, and could lead to cancer themselves.  Also, DNA cross over at meiosis could be altered leading to chromosomic abnormalities and genomic instability would also be enforced.</p></div>
