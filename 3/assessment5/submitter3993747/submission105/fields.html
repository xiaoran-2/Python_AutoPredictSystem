    <h1>Submission 105 from Anon (session_user_id: 78fafe8163fefc81f6696f1d2ed807480f3a2f9a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the "DNA demethylating agent" class of epigenetic inhibitors. This drug can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, blood malignancies that can lead to leukemia, by hypomethylating the cellular DNA. The malignant epigenome may consist of extra methyl groups on tumor suppressor genes, which causes these genes to be inactivated and allows cancer cells to proliferate. Decitabine irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase which leads to demethylation, although the exact mechanism of action is not fully understood. Once the excess methyls are removed the tumor suppressor genes can function normally, reducing cells' malignant potential. DNA demethylating agents have been shown to have synergistic effects when combined with histone deacetylase inhibitors or chemotherapeutics--this can lead to an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation status is heritable to future generations of cells because the epigenome is not cleared during normal cell division (due to the action of DNMT1). Thus, a drug that alters DNA methylation can have effects that outlive the treatment period. Epigenetic marks are cleared during specific periods in development called sensitive periods. During these periods, changes in the environment can affect the epigenome. The epigenome is cleared during early embryonic development (from the fertilized egg to epiblast), and then again during primordial germ cell development. It would not be wise to treat certain patients with epigenetic drugs because they target every cell in the body. First, the developing germ cells of young patients could be negatively impacted by drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery; so these drugs shouldn't be targeted at young patients. Second, pregnant women shouldn't be given these drugs until after the epigenetic sensitive period of early embryonic development has passed (or else the embryo may lack essential epigenetic markings for proper development!).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated. However, sometimes methylation occurs within a select few CpG island sites found in promoters in order to silence gene expression (primarily due to a subsequent repressive chromatin structure or by inhibiting transcription factor binding). In cancer, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands can silence tumor suppressor genes epigenetically. Alternatively, hypomethylation of CpG islands can activate oncogenes. Since the methylation is heritable, all progeny cancer cells will have the same epigenome, which may contribute to their malignant phenotype. The pattern of DNA methylation at CpG islands varies by tumor type, but can still serve as a useful biomarker tool. Apart from cancer, DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands can lead to unwanted gene silencing, or hypomethylation can lead to unwanted gene activation. Both of these unwanted phenotypes can contribute to diseases other than cancer, depending on the genes affected.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally helps to maintain genomic integrity and stability (ie. preventing transposition). In cancer, hypomethylation of DNA at these regions is observed in all tumors. This leads to genomic instability. Unmethylated repeats can lead to illegitimate recombinations. The lack of methylation also can activate repeats and transposition, which can affect other genes (depending on where transposition occurs). Additionally, cryptic promoters may be activated, disrupting the activity of adjacent genes. All of these events contribute to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Other diseases may also be associated with changes in DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. As the example of cancer shows, DNA hyper- and hypomethylation in these regions can greatly affect the rest of the genome. If a transposon was mobilised into the exons of a critical gene, it is easy to see how disease can ensue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting control region (ICR) and part of the H19 gene are methylated. The ICR methylation inhibits CTFC from binding to it and allows the enhancer to loop around and bind Igf2. Thus, the paternal allele leads to high levels of Igf2 expressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. CTFC then binds the ICR and blocks the enhancer from reaching Igf2. Instead the enhancer binds to and promotes transcription of H19. Thus, the maternal allele leads to low levels of Igf2 expressed. In Wilm's tumor, you see an overexpression of Igf2 which is caused by disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. The maternal allele is methylated, which essentially makes it act like the paternal allele. Therefore you have enhanced transcription of Igf2 from both alleles, and end up with high levels of Igf2. As shown by the Wilm's tumor example, changes in genomic imprinting can disrupt the special balance that is required for disease-free life. If the paternal allele was hypomethylated, you would see insufficient expression of Igf2 which could also lead to disease.</p></div>
