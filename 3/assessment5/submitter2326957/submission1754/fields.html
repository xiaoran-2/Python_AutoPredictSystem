    <h1>Submission 1754 from Anon (session_user_id: 830e4ead556b726703346dac43ad964466a7980f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable, which means that they are passed during cell division to the daughter cells, which causes that they have lasting effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period of development is a period when epigenetic reprogramming takes place (epigenetic marks are erasted and reestablished). It's "sensitive", because changes in environment can cause then defects in creating epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development: primordial germ cell development and early (pre-implantation) development.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs altering DNA methylation marks during sensitive periods is a bad idea, because it may cause defects in embryo or in germ cells, which will last, becase epigenetic marks established during sensitive periods are longlasting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG inslands is silencing of gene expression. Most CpG islands stays unmethylated. In cancer there is an increased methylation at CpG islands. This causes silencing of many genes, for exemple tumour suppresor genes, which leads to disease.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in interginic regions and repetitive elements is silencing this repetetive elements and transposons. Normally this regions are highly methylated, but in cancer they are hypomethylated, which causes activation of repetetive elements. This leads to genomic instability and may also activate some oncogenes, which where previously silences, and this causes cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On paternal allele ICR is methylated. This blocks binding of CTCF to ICR. Without CTCF methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silencing it. Enhancers can access Igf2, Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>On maternal allele there is no methylation. CTCF binds to ICR and insulates Igf2 from enhancers. Enhacers instead access H19. Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour both alleles are imprinted as paternal alleles (maternal allele acts as paternal allele). This causes overexpression of Igf2 which is a growth factor and a potential oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylase inhibitor (DNMTi). It causes demethylation of DNA (although in larger doses its effects fades). It's still unclear how Decitabine acts agains tumour, but it may be because it causes demethylation of tumour-suppresor genes, so actives this genes and they suppress tumour as name suggests.</p></div>
