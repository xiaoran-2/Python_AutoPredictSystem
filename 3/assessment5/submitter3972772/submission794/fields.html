    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells where as in cancer cells these are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation in CpG islands inactivates the tumor suppressor genes hence promoting carcinogenesis. Also Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells but hypomethylated or unmethylated in cancer cells. The disruption from methylated to unmethylated or hypomethylation leads to genomic instability. This instability can lead to chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, translocations and insertions etc., which may lead to tumoregenisis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In h19/Igf2 imprinting cluster region (ICR) the paternal allele is methylated whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated. CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2(insulin like growth factor gene II), a <strong>growth promoting gene</strong>, from downstream enhancers.  DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF with enhancers. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate and hence the Igf2 is expressed on paternal allele. When it is un methylated the CTFC can bind to enhancers blocking the Igf2 and enhancer interaction so that Igf2 cannot be expressed instead H19 will be expressed in maternal allele. In Wilms’ tumor the hypermethylation of maternal allele of Igf2 leads to loss of imprinting (40-60% of Wilms’ tumor). Igf2 is expressed from both maternal as well as paternal alleles leading to a double/over dose of this growth promoting gene compared to normal cells leading to tumor formation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMT-inhibitors.  Decitabine is an hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltranferase.  In tumors which are resulted due to hyper methylation of tumor suppressor genes the decitabine restores the genes by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase(DNMT). DNMT is required to maintain the DNA methylation during cell division. DNMT methylates the new DNA strand resulted due to replication keeping old DNA strand as a template. So in the absence of DNMT the new strand will not have methyalation. DNA methylation will be completely absent in granddaughter cells after subsequent divisions.  So by restoring the tumor suppressive activity and inhibiting the cell proliferation decitabline demonstrates anti-tumor effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Yes, drugs that alter DNA methylation can strip off methyl tags from all sorts of other genes too leaving enduring effects on the epigenome. These changes are inherited mitotically and hence passed on to subsequent divisions. This change in the epigenome can have unwanted effects if it happens during sensitive periods. The sensitive period is defined as the periods during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Germ cell development and early embryonic development are the sensitive periods during which the epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  Hence treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods is not advisable as these drugs are expected to cause potentially serious side effects.  </p></div>
