    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells there are hypomethylated CpG islands in contrast with cancer cells in which the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. In its standard form, unmethylated CpG islands are responsible to activate tumor suppressor genes so normal cells can precede without tumorgenesis. If methylated, these CpG islands lead to silencing of tumor suppressing genes, which promotes tumorgenesis. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected, these epimutated cells are favorable to divide more rapidly and not die as much which leads to an advantage the can result in the formation of the tumor, which contributes to the advancement of the disease. This hypermethylation in CpG islands varies by tumor type, progresses with time and in Imprint Control Regions can lead to loss of imprinting. In normal cells the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns are more likely to be methylated (hypermethylation) By contrast, cancer cells tend to be unmethylated in the same kind regions (hypomethylation). The effects depend on the region where the methylation is lost on the genome. This is related to genomic instability due the loss of methylation and heterochromatin form of the repeats. This leads to alignment of repeats and illegitimate recombination between them which leads to reciprocal translocations, deletion and insertion between chromosomes parts. So it can activate certain repeats or misplaced transpositions. As a result it can activate cryptic promoters or disrupt of neighbouring genes which promotes tumorgenesis. Hypomethylation in certain CpG poor promoters can also relate to cancer progression since most of these promoters are associated with the activation of cancer related genes. So loss DNA methylation can either promote tumorgenesis by reducing tumor suppressor genes inactivation or enhance it by the increased genetic instability. As a conclusion the effect of DNA methylation can be cancer stage specific.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be promoted by hypo/hypermethylation on imprinting control region (ICR) of growth related genes. For example, H19/Igf2 cluster is a group of the genes that display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression which means only one of the parental alleles is expressed. In a normal cell the paternal allele has the ICR of this genes methylated, and a maternal allele with the same region unmethylated. In the maternal allele the unmethylated ICR will bind with CTCF, which will act as an insulator, making the enhancers act on H19 and IGF2 will not be expressed. In the pattern allele as the ICR is methylated so CTCF won’t be able to bind to it. Therefore the enhancers can act on IGF2. So the IGF2 will be expressed only on the pattern allele. Loss of imprinting cause hypermethylation of both ICR in each allele. So enhancers will act on IGF2 on both alleles. If IGF2 is overexpressed, the cell will present a double dose of this growth factor. As a growth promoting factor, the overexpression of IGF2 is associated with Wilm’s tumour, once the cells will grow abnornamlly which contributes for the spread of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a methyltransferase inhibitor. It is sold as Dacogen by Eisai and it is a FDA approved drug used in myelodysplastic syndrome that as progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This inhibitor gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind a DNA sequence. So it binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase preventing the methylation of a daughter strand which makes this drug division dependent. Once cancer cells that divide more rapidly than any other cell in the body will be more severely affected by this drug. This makes this drug targets mostly tumor cells although this mechanism is not very well known since is can also effect normal since they also divide at some point. This drug has been on trial for many malignancies and in AML patients, this drug has been very effective possibly because of GpC island hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, which means such epigenetic changes as DNA methylation is passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased. If erased, they do not return in subsequent lineages. So unlike other forms of gene regulation such as transcription factors, epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome that past beyond the period of drug treatment. Epigenetics treatments can therefore stop mutagenesis without cell destruction. Hence this drugs must be avoid in periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development also known as sensitive periods. In this periods there is a clearing of epigenetic marks and low levels of DNA methylation. So if the drugs act in these periods it can lead to hypo/hyper methylation of incorrect parts of DNA which can cause disruption of the epigenome. In somatic cells epigenetic marks are maintain so  if a epigenetic mark it’s critical to a cell can compromise all its lineage. Therefore it is inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods since epigenetic reprograming can affect the expression of the genes even though there is no genetic mutation involved.</p></div>
