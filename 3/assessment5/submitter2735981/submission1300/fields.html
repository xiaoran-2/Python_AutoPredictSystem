    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is the basis of imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, heterochromatin formation, and is generally correlated with gene inactivation. DNA methylation is found in intergenic regions at satellite repeats and retroviral insertions where it inactivates mobile genetic elements and retroviral promoters. GpG islands in promoter regions of genes are usually not methylated, but in cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated which silences the underlying gene.</p>
<p>Disruption of methylation at CpG islands leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes when CpG islands in the promoters of these genes become hypermethylated. Genome-wide hypomethylation leads to activation of repeats and retroviral insertions, which increases genomic instability. Genomic instability can result from mobile genetic elements, and alignment errors at repeats causing insertions, deletions, and occasional chromosomal translocations. Failure to silence retroviral promoters can also lead to transcriptional interference or to increased dosages from genes. Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted genes can cause increased dosage from proto-oncogenes.</p>
<p>Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes -- e.g. genes required for apoptosis -- and over-expression of growth promoting genes such as Igf2, can lead to tumor formation. In addition, some imprinted genes are associated with stem-cellness and promote stem-cell characteristics such as mobility and immortality; loss of imprinting can upregulate these genes, and -- when mobility and immortality are coupled with loss of genomic integrity -- can potentially produce metastatic cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the H19 region and the CTCF binding site are hypermethylated and this permits downstream enhancers to activate Igf2. In the maternal allele, H19 and the CTCF binding site are not methylated and the downstream enhancers act on H19 which is transcribed to form a lncRNA; CTCF binds to its site which prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the H19 on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, which causes expression of Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal alleles -- i.e. Igf2 is double dosed. Igf2 is a growth factor and its overdosing contributes to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and results in passive demethylation through attenuation by cell division. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. By hypomethylating CpG islands it can reactivate tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced due to methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can lead to altered chromatin structure which persists beyond the period of treatment. Baylin discusses how EZH2 methylates not DNA but histone proteins, which leads to a more closed chromatin structure and silences genes; tumor suppressor genes silenced in this way promote tumorigenisis. Conversely, drugs that inhibit EZH2 can reduce methylation of histones and produce a more open chromatin, allowing tumor suppressor genes to be expressed.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a developmental period during which epigenetic marks are being erased or laid down. This happens very pronouncedly around the time of blastocyst implantation and during primordial germ cell development. But tissue specific epigenetic marks are laid down during fetal development and in childhood, which are also sensitive periods; in particular, there appear to be many epigenetic marks associated with brain development. Epigenetic therapies would be inadvisable during these periods because they could have lifelong effects on these tissues, or -- if they impact germ cells -- on the next generation.</p></div>
