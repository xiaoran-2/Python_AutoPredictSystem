    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a CH3 group to the 5 position of cytosine base (5mC) which can induce specific effects on the gene. It is the basis for different epigenetics phenomena such as X chromosome inactivation, imprinting and the formation of heterochromatin. Usually, DNA methylation of the promoter region inversely correlates with gene expression. CpG islands are exceptions. The CpG islands are found in about 60 % of the promoters. They have high CpG density and in normal cells they are unmethylated apart from their state of activity.</p>
<p>On the other hand in cancer cells the promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated, which cause transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells, e.g. activation of R-Ras and miR21.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation combine a genom-wide loss and a regional gain. This can cause genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific imprinted genes. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes i.e controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, alters the promoter CpG islands methylation pattern by hypermethylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity. These regions are usually methylated. For intergenic elements the normal functions are, the effect of Dnmt1 and silencing cryptic transciption start sites and cryptic splice sites. For repetitive elements silencing of repeats to avoid transciptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent transposition. Mutation of meC to T to prevent transposition and methylation to prevent incorrect recombination. </p>
<p>In cancer cells the intergenic and specially the repetitive elements are hypomethylated and can induce incorrect recombination, activation and transposition.</p>
<p>The disruption in DNA methylation in the intergenic and repetitive regions are related to missalignment which can cause illegitimate recombination because they are not densely packed down into heterochromosome. Overall in abnormal cells improper deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations could occur because of genetic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, it demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase, a family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl (CH3) group to DNA.</p>
<p>Many cancers of the immune systems or lymphomas are caused by a mutation in an enzyme called EZH2. This enzyme attaches CH3 groups to histone proteins and when  becomes overactive EZH2 overmethylates the histone proteins. This silences the tumor suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled proliferation of cell growths that causes cancer. Decitabine helps to restore the activity of the tumor suppressor gene and this way it prevents abnormal cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable genetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>
<p>During embriogenesis, where the DNA synthetic rate is very high, there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetics mechanisms. E<span>pigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and chromatin modifications required for normal tissue development are established during these early development stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Sensitive periods are, first, the primordial germ cell development where the production of mature egg and sperm occur and the second sensitive period is the pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods. These are the periods of active remodelling of the epigenom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Treating patients during these sensitive periods </span><span style="font-size:14px;">can cause changes of the normal developmental paterns with unpredictable consequences.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated and the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to it. The enhancers, further down on the allele, are free to act on Igf2 because it is not insulated. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and the long non-coding RNA, H19 is produced here. Because the ICR is unmethylated CTCF can bind to it and insulate Igf2 from the enhancers. The enhancerscan will act on H19 only and enhance its expression. H19 is not an epigenetic modifier.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Wilm's tumor is a kidney tumor in childhood. It occurs as a result of epigenetic disruption. Caused by the loss of imprinting due to the loss of the maternal allele, uniparental disomy, which results in the overload of the oncogene Igf2 which results in cancer.</span></p>
<p>Loss of imprinting, loss of the tumor suppressor gene Cdkn1c expression and upregulation of the oncogene Igf2 is a common feature of cancer.</p>
