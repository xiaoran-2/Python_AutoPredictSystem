    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1<br />    The CpG islands can be related to cancer. They can be hypo- or hyper- methylated, which means there are some abnormalities and deseases. Normal methylation at these sites is needed to swich off or on genes to make it a skin or a muscle cell. Methylation of DNA is one of the processes in differentiation. Activation or inactivation, as swiching, can either be a genetic or epigenetic. Cancer is a desease in which both oncogenes are activated and a tumours suppressor genes are inactivated by this swiching.<br />    In a normal cell, CpG islands are poorly methylated and the global methylation level is high. As tumourgenesis goes, it disrupts: CpGs becomes hypermethylated and the whole level shrinks. This can indicate a cancer type which is driven by turmour suppressor genes inactivation. This means that as hypermethylation occurs, transcription rate of turmour suppressor genes slows and genes come to be inactive. In fact, hypermethylation is tumour specific because  it's CpGs are different in cancers.<br />    If a cancer is that it's a concequence of oncogenes activation, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated. In this case, CpGs are located at promoters of these genes, so hypomethylation means activation and transcribtion of genes and this leads to desease and cancer.<br />    Another relevant methylation place is repetitive elements and intergenic regions. An important fact is that these sites are methylated in normal cells because it's clear that repetitives can copy and paste themselves anywhere in the genome. This could alter the stability of genome if they were hypomethylated because it would activate them. These transpositions can make mutations and be an argue in cancer and another diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q2<br />  In a normal fashion there are one allele of Igf2/H19 cluster which is activated. <br />  Allele inherited from the mother or maternal allele works like that: imprinting control region (ICR) is not methylated and can bind to insulator protein CTCF and insulate Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers. This is because long noncoding RNA, named H19, then is being transcribed. It covers and inactivates all Igf2 gene allele, as Xist does in X chromosome inactivation.<br />  In normal paternal allele of this cluster ICR is methylated and it blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate and transcribe this gene.<br />  In Wilm's turmour maternal allele works not properly. ICR is methylated so CTCF protein can no longer bind. H19 is not transcribed and maternal allele of Igf2 gene is active. This means there are overexpression of this gene because of hypermethylation.<br />  It's one of the scenarios of loss of imprinting in deseases. Both alleles could be silenced or overexpress if that gene is hypo- or hyper- methylated. And if overexpressed gene is growing promoting, this could be a cause of cancer.<br /> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q3<br />Decitabine is a drug, sold as Dacogen by Japanese company Eisay. It's DNA-demethylating agent. As the name says, it's demethylates DNA itself or activates enzyme Dnmt. If a cell's tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, this drug could fix it. This fixing or epigenetic change is passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until it's actively erased. Once erased, they don't occur. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can affect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q4<br />  Sensitive periods are times in reprogramming when DNA methylation is at its lowest levels. There are two sensitive periods: one from fertilization until germ cell development and the second is after birth. In another words, sensitive period is when altered environment can have an effect on epigenetic control, it's like an event of "unprotected DNA". The very first sensitive period is not so explored as it could be due to ethical issues and the period after birth comes to be very important. Lets see why.<br />  DNA methylation is a very stable mark since it's inherited mitotically because of enzyme Dnmt. That's why any change in DNA methylation transferase due to environment effects will be passed to second generations.<br />  In cancers, Dnmt inhibitors is being used. It helps to restore methylation levels but what if a patient is around ten years old? It'a a time when sensitive period for food supply is.</p>
