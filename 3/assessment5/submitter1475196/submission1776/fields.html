    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer because it is very important for the survival of the tumoral cells to promote the mitosis. CPG islands (regions rich in C and G that can activate the expression of a gene when they are not methylated) can be methylated or not depending of the function of the gene. In cancer is it possible to disrupted the CPG islands of genes which contributes to the cell division, letting that the cell could divides without any control. Is it possible also to alterate the methylation state in other parts of the genome, like for example intergenic regions or repetitive elements. These regions are normally methylated because this methylation contributes to the stability of the genome and avoid the possible invasion of transposons into other parts of our genome, in cancer these methylation dissapears, making the DNA unstable and producing breakages that can alter the expression of some genes (activating protoncogenes or silencin tumor supressors genes)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele is it possible to see that the imprinting of the region ICR avoids the binding of one protein (CTCF), this action lets to the enhancers to activate the IGF2 gene. In the maternal allele, this ICR region is not methylated and can be recognized by the CTCF protein, this binding modify the DNA letting the enhancers to activate H19 gene. IGF2 is a gene that promotes cell división, for that reason when someone has Willm's tumour if we see the genome we can find two copies with the patternal allele and this double activation of IGF2 gene lets to the cell divides more than a normal cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, its function is to remove methylation in CPG islands, this demethylation could have an antitumoral effect because it can reactivate tumor supressor genes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>methylation is a reaction very strong that stabilizes the genome, for that reason when you methylate one gene is very difficult to recover the initial state. a sensitive period is these periods during the development when we erase the pattern of imprinting to create a new one, these periods are the pre-implantational period and the germ cells, is very difficult to treat patients in that period because we are altering the methylation state of a genome which is changing its methylation state, this could produce an aberrant pattern of methylation</p></div>
