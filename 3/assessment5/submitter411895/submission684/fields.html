    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> If imprinting is disrupted at genes that regulate cell cycle, such genes are the oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, then genome instability is observed. An example of disrupted instability is the H19/Igf2 cluster which is normally differentially imprinted .<br /><br />The paternal allele is methylated at its ICR together with the H19 promoter. This allows downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene. Secondary methylation at DMR’s near the Igf2 gene occure after fertilization. <br /><br />The maternal allele is not methylated at its ICR allowing CTCF to bind together with P68/5RA and Cohesin stimulating downstream enhacers to access the unmethylated H19 gene but simultaneously blocking access to the Igf2 gene. The secondary DMR’s remain unmethylated. So we can see that Ifg2 is expressed from the paternal allele while H19 is expressed from the maternal allele.<br /><br />One example of disrupted imprinting is in Wilms disease a kind of childhood kidney cancer where maternal imprinting is lost. This means that the maternal ICR gets methylated together with the H19 promoter resulting to H19 repression. Since The ICR is methylated then the enhancers have access to the Igf2 gene. This disorder results to no expression of the ncRNA  H19 and overexpression of Igf2  which in turn has mutagenic and growth regulating activities so over expression of this gene leads to possible tumirogennesis.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>eIn a normal cell DNA methylation is set usually at repetitive sequences, intergenic regions and gene introns and is used to silence genes that are not meant to be expressed. On the other hand CpG islands tend to be unmethylated at more than 60% of the time. These CpG islands are located around promoters of genes that regulate basic cell functions.<br />Cancer cells have changes in DNA structure. One of these changes is found to be altered methylation of DNA. Usually unmethylated CpG islands that are active get methylated thus being silenced. Methylation of DNA mostly occurs at the C-5 position of the cytosine in these CpG dinucleotides. This means a tumor repressor gene that is not expressed allows oncogens to be over expressed. And the other way round, methylated CpG islands are unmethylated so oncogenes get expressed where or when they shouldn't.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements as mentioned above in normal cells are usullaly methylated to maintain genomic integrity, once this methylation pattern is disrupted then the unmethylated Intergenic regions (these regions contain enhancers and promoters of genes and possibly non coding RNA transcripts) become active and various gene promoters and enhacers are then transcribed activating oncogenes or silencing tumor repressing agents. Repetetive elements are usually remains of retrotransposable DNA that are silenced via the methylation mecanosm to remain silent. Altering methylation of these elements may have a huge impact on genomic instability and transcription.</p>
<p>As we can see demethylating methylated (thus silenced) regions of DNA and methylating of demethylated (thus active) regions of DNA means that the DNA factory gets out of production line and so the product is defective leading if not to cell death to tumirogenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug under a category named DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is a  mechanism that regulates gene expression by silencing the gene when C-5 position of the cytosine is methylated in the DNA strand.   Problems occure when there is an increase in DNA methylation leading to silencing tumor suppressor genes. These genes normally regulate cell division and growth so when they are silenced another category of genes - the oncogenes - are overregulated leading possibly to cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine's  works by demethylating or interfering with the methylation of DNA by inhibiting DNMT. This means that it prevents overmethylation of DNA so genes remain active. Decitabine is an analog to cytidine and so binds to DNMT preventing it to bind to cytidine which it normally methylates.  Research has shown that Decitabine also induces apoptosis to cancer cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA does not mutate the genes but only silences them or activates them and is a mechanism that is mitotically heredited meaning once it is established the daughter cells have the same epigenetic markings as the mother cell. These changes do not refer to the organisms' offsprings but only to somatic cells that undergo such transformation. A tumurous cell when divided creates two new cancer cells then these two create four and so on... breaking the cycle and altering epigenetic state means that some of those somatic cancer cells stop dividing into new cancer cells so slowing down tumor growth.</p>
<p>           After fertilazation we have two periods that are defined as sensitive epigenetically. This mean that they are periods were methylation/imprinting is removed and established later. The first is at early development were we have removal of methylation only and the differentition of somatic cells to different tissue cells. The second period is during the reprogramming of the primordial germ cells where both methylation and imprinting is removed. This is nessecary to produce gametes with the correct imprintig. </p>
<p>Treating patients that are undergoing these procedues, males aged 9 to 13 and females 8 to12 as well as during pregnacy means that methylation and imprinting will be disrupted so their offsprings might have severe problems or will not survive.</p></div>
