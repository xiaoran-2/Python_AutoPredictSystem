    <h1>Submission 636 from Anon (session_user_id: 5c99a967f6a04e2909deb9549354e6416d98f586)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (or methyltransferase inhibitor) used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)<span>. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thus hypomethylating DNA. Cancer cells tend to have hypermethylated promoter CpG islands and upstream enhancers which then silence the genes the promoters or enhancers would have activated. Since some of the silenced genes are tumor-suppressor genes, by undoing the hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, Decitabine restores tumor-suppressor gene functions and reverses cancerous cell growth. The anti-cancer effect of Decitabine is more easily achieved in fluid environments such as the blood and bone marrow, hence its efficacy on MDS patients. Recently, however, Dr. Baylin found that a similar drug to Decitabine called azacitidine can be combined with histone-deacetylase inhibitors to slow the growth of solid tumors in some patients as well.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable, as they are copied faithfully in daughter cells during somatic cell division. That's why drugs that alter DNA methylation have lasting effects beyond the treatment period. There are, however, sensitive periods during which treatment should be avoided. During sensitive periods including primordial germ cell (PGC) development and pre-implantation embryonic development, the epigenome is actively remodeled. During PGC development, most epigenetic marks are erased before PGC-specific ones are laid down again. This means that the PGC epigenome is highly sensitive to environmental factors such as a pregnant mother's or a pubescent boy's diet and substance-use habits. During early development, although epigenetic marks in imprinted regions are not erased, other allele-specific epigenetic marks are erased and then re-established. These sensitive periods also translate into periods of germ cell maturation that could affect transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, i.e., fetal and infantile periods of grandmothers, 8-10 years of age of grandmothers, and 9-12 years of age of grandfathers. Thus, drugs that alter DNA methylation are inadvisable during sensitive periods including pre-pregnancy, early pregnancy, fetal and infant development, and puberty.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Rather than hypermethylating intergenic regions and repeats and hypomethylating promoter-site CpG islands, as in normal cells, cancer cells have the reverse: hypomethylated intergenic regions and repeats and hypermethylated promoter-site CpG islands. These anomalies wreck genetic stability and silence tumor suppressors, making it easier for cancerous cell growth.</p>
<p>Proper DNA methylation is required for embryogenesis and development, chromosomal stability, telomere length and maintaining predetermined expression states.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repeats tend to be methylated. This is thought to curb expression of retroviral DNA inserts and maintain genetic stability by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombination. Methylation at exon-intron boundaries may also silence cryptic splice sites and direct alternative splicing.  In contrast, cancer cells have hypomethylated intergenic regions and repeats.  Hypomethylated intergenic regions could enable false alternative splicing and expression of retroviral inserts; and hypomethylated repeats could lead to transcriptional interference and transposition of repeats, compounding genetic mutations with each mitotic replication. This means more false expressions and more genetic mutations, thus more chances of tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands at promoter sites tend to be unmethylated, whether the underlying gene is activated or not. Keeping these CpG islands unmethylated makes them less prone to mutation while keeping pathways to gene expression open. Methylation of CpG islands work in concert with various histone marks to modify chromatin structure and regulate tissue-specific gene expression profiles such that the specialized cell only expresses the genes it's supposed to express. In cancer cells, CpG islands at promoter sites are hypermethylated, which silences the underlying genes, including tumor suppressor genes. When cancer cells divide, the hypermethylation is copied mitotically. This enables uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer is loss of imprinting. Imprinted genes are expressed from either the maternal or paternal allele, and imprinting tends to affect growth rates. If imprint control is disrupted, it could lead to over expression of oncogenes and/or suppression of tumor suppressor genes, both contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 example, the imprint control region on the paternal allele is hypermethylated, which prevents CTCF from binding and thus allows enhancers to preferencially loop to Igf2, a growth promoter, and activate its expression. The imprint control region on the maternal allele is hypomethylated, which lets CTCF bind to block enhancers. The enhancers thus loop to H19 and activate it instead of Igf2. In a normal cell, this balances the expression level of the growth-promoting Igf2, but if imprinting is disrupted, this balance would be wrecked. For example, in Wilm's tumor, the maternal imprint control region is also hypermethylated, leading the maternal allele to behave just like the paternal allele where Igf2 is expressed instead of H19. This doubling of Igf2 expression leads to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In other scenarios, imprinting can be disrupted by disomy or genetic mutation, potentially leading to over- or under-expressions.</p></div>
