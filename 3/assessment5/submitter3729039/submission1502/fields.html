    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are mostly present at the promoters of genes, are normally unmethylated, which allows for gene activation. Cancer cell genome presents a CIMP phenotype (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype), as its CpG islands are hypermethylated. This leads to gene silencing, which is case of tumor suppressor genes causes abnormal cell growth.<br /><br />Healthy cells present genome-wide hypermethylation. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which constitute the most part of the genome, are methylated. This prevents uncontrolled DNA recombination and translocations of genes. In contrast, cancer cells present genome-wide hypomethylation. Unmethylated DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in transpositions which cause gene insertions and deletions, chromosome duplications, and activation of strong promoters, that are normally methylated within these regions, which interfere in gene transcription with other normally activated promoters. Thus DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is an imprinted gene, expressed from the paternal and not from the maternal allele. Its imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal chromosome. This DNA methylation spreads to another nearby imprinted gene, H19, silencing it and allowing upstream enhancers reach Igf2 to activate its expression. On the maternal chromosome, the ICR for these imprinted genes is unmethylated, which allows it to bind the protein CTCF. This insulator protein prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2 expression.<br /><br />Since Igf2 is an oncogene, that is it promotes cell growth, it is important to have the correct amount of its protein in the cell. In Wilm's tumor this differential expression of Igf2 between paternal and maternal allele, is disrupted, as on both chromosomes 11 the ICR for H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated. This is followed by the expression of Igf2 from both chromosomes. The overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 results in abnormal cell growth and tumor formation.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that inhibits DNMT enzymes, that lay down DNA-methylation. Thus decitabine causes the DNA to be unmethylated. This increases gene activation, as CpG islands at gene promoters are unmethylated. It can also lead to genomic instability, as unmethylated intergenic regions and repeats increase DNA translocations.<br /><br />In case of cancer cells, decitabine can mitigate the CIMP phenotype, leaving CpG islands at gene promoters unmethylated, which brings gene expression closer to normal. However it does not fix DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions, rather it makes it deeper increasing genomic instability.</p>
<p><br />DNA methylation inhibitors in combination with HDAC inhibitors have been tested in patients with lung cancer, where they altered tumor cells in a way that chemotherapy had better results. This can be explained by the fact that epigenetic marks are passed mitotically, and DNA methylation inhibitors present during one cell division leave the replicated DNA unmethylated, this state is maintained in next steps of cell division, limiting the tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks, such as DNA or histone methylation and histone acetylation, are mitotically heritable, that is, they are passed from one cell to its daughter cells. In particular, DNA methylation is laid down on a hemi-methylated DNA during replication by DNMT1.<br /><br />There exist sensitive periods in the maintainance of epigenetic marks during development, when epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the epigenetic marks are removed and then new epigenetic marks are placed. This happens during early embryo development and during primordial germ cell formation at late embryo development.<br /><br />Pregnant women should not be treated with apigenetic drugs, as the treatment would have effects on the epigenome of the offspring. The epigenetic marks introduced by the drugs in the embryo would be maintained during the life of the offspring causing genomic and epigenomic abnormalities and most possibly cancer.</p></div>
