    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGI) are often found at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation as their methylation causes the silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways: hypermethylation of regions that are unmethylated in normal cells and hypomethylation of regions normally methylated.</p>
<p><strong>Hypermethylation</strong> is locus-specific. The most common type of hypermethylation is associated with CGI and shores of CGI (regions 2 kb downstream and upstream of CGI) of tumour supressor genes promoters. Hypermethylation of these regions, unmethylated in normal cells, leads to silencing of tumour supressor genes, one of the hallmarks of cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, genome-wide <strong>hypomethylation</strong> is also a general rule in cancer, especially at repetitive elements but also in intergenic regions and poor promoters, normally methylated in normal cells.</p>
<p>Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions in normal cells is a key fact to mantain genomic stability by heterochromatinization. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements opens the chromatine and this structural change favours the illegitimate recombination by misalignement. The illegitimate recombination can result in deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions that are the cause for the origin of many tumours.</p>
<p>In addition, the hypomethylation of repetitive elements may have two effects: activation of neighbouring genes due to the activation of the promoters of repeated elements and disruption of other genes due to transposition. Depending on the nature of the activated of disrupted gene (oncogene or tumour suppressor gene) this can also lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in cell growth and changes in methylation of the ICRs lead to loss of expression of genes that restrict growth or overexpression of those that promote it. ICR can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated, leading to the silencing or expression or both parental alleles, otherwise imprinted.</p>
<p>In normal cells H19/Igf2 cluster is paternal imprinted:</p>
<ul><li>In the maternal allele ICR (imprinted control region) is unmethylated and bounded to CTCF protein. This binding prevents that the downstream enhancers act on Igf2, so Igf2 is silenced. Instead of promoting the expression of Igf2, these enhancers promote the expression of lncRNA H19.</li>
<li>In the paternal allele ICR is methylated so it can't bind with CTCF and the enhancers can promote the expression of Igf2. Besides, the ICR methylation spreads to H19, so this lncRNA is not expressed.</li>
</ul><p>In Wilm's tumour maternal and paternal ICR are methylated. In this case both alleles behave as if they were paternal and the cell has double dose of Igf2 product, the insulin-like growth factor 2. This protein promotes the growth and proliferation of cells and can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Chemically decitabine is a cytidine analog that acts as a hypomethylation agent by inhibiting DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1).<br />DNA methylation occurs at CGI, regions with abundant cytosine-guanine dinucleotides. During replication decitabine can be incorporated into DNA instead of cytidine. When DNMT1 binds to the hemimethylated CpG dinucleotide it remains irreversibly attached to decitabine. It results in an inactivation of DNMT1.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CGI is associated with gene inactivation and hypermethylation is implicated in cancer by blocking the expression of tumour suppressor genes. In this context, hypomethylation can result in a restoration of cell division regulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic state of a cell may be altered by direct mechanisms as DNA methylation. Drugs that induce DNA methylation can change the epigenetic state of the cell by compacting chromatine and silencing genes. Epigenetic changes can persist after the drug is discontinued and be transmited to daugther cells through mitosis.</p>
<p>The epigenetic makeup, being reversible, tends to remain stable for the lifetime of that cell.<br />However, during sensitive periods an active remodeling of cell's epigenetic state is produced. In these periods environment can affect epigenetic control because epigenetic marks are being removed and laying down to define a new epigenetic state.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are:</p>
<ul><li>Period of primordial cell development that leads to the production of sperm and eggs.</li>
<li>Early embriologic stages, around implantation (blastocyst stage).</li>
<li>Periods of cellular differentiation, specific for each particular organ.</li>
</ul><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could generate epigenetic make up been detrimental to cells, not only the targeted cells but other cells, as every cell can be affected with the drugs used. This can cause harmful side-effects. Besides, to alter epigenetic machinery in patients that are maturing germ cells can have effects that pass to the following generations.</p></div>
