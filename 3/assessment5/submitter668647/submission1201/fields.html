    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA methylation a methyl group is added to cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark which can be passed on to coming generations through X chromosome inactivation and parental imprinting of specific genes. Its function is to influence and stabilize gene expression. </p>
<p>CpG islands are genomic regions with a high frequency of CpG sites. CpG dinucleotides contain a guanine and a cytosine base sharing a phosphodiester bond; the cytosine can be<span> methylated to form 5-methylcytosine</span>. In mammalian somatic cells, CpG islands are present in about 60% of promoter regions. In normal cells,  CpG islands are hypomethylated, while other regions, such as repeats, introns and intergenic regions are more highly methylated. Alterations in DNA methylation of CpG sites lead to genomic instability and have been associated with cancer. Hypermethylation results in silencing of tumour suppressor genes. An accumulation of epigenetic insults to a cell can cause it to mutate and, if it happens to be selected for, in the absence of tumour suppressor genes, it will continue reproducing, giving rise to cancer formations. Furthermore, as the cancer progresses, CpG islands become more heavily methylated, enhancing this effect, a process which also occurrs naturally with ageing. Different cancers are associated with different sets of methylated CpG islands. </p>
<p>As mentioned before, in normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated, but in cancer cells they are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation causes the chromatin to be more open, again resulting in genomic instability. Hypomethylated repeats can misalign and produce illegitimate recombinations. They also become active and can duplicate themselves, moving around the genome and affecting other genes, causing insertions and deletions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilm's tumour, a malignant childhood kidney cancer, is caused by loss of imprinting. The imprint control region of the Igf2/H19 region is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal one. On the maternal allele, this region is bound by an insulator protein, CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from the enhancers found downstream, causing it to become silent. The enhancers instead promote expression of H19. On the paternal allele methylation does not allow CTCF to bind. In this case, the enhancers downstream can promote expression of Igf2, causing paternal imprinting activation. Disruption of imprinting and hypermethylation of the maternal allele result in biallelic expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoter and it's overexpression is linked with several types of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic processes are inherited but can be reversible and respond to drug treatment. At present, different drugs are undergoing clinical trials, but others are already on the market. The <span>DNA-demethylating agent decitabine is one of these. Sold by a Japanese company as <span>Dacogen, it is FDA approved for use in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (hematological blood condition) that has progressed to acute myeloleukemia (AML). It works by inhibiting DNA methytransferase and allowing for re-expression of tumour suppressor genes previously silenced by hypermethylation. DNML inhibitors, like decitabine, are nucleoside analogs. During replication, they get incorporated into the DNA and then irreversibly bind to methytransferase, so that methylation can be no longer copied to the daughter cell.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The idea is that epigenetic drugs erase epigenetic marks, effectively altering gene expression in a lasting way. This suggests that subsequent responses, and therefore responses to other treatments such as a chemotherapy, will also change. However, these processes are not yet fully understood, and altering epigenetic drugs - such as an acetylase, or a methyltransferase inhibitor, or other - are not selective for cancer cells alone and can have a wider and unexpected effect on the genome.</p>
<p>The epigenetic system responds more readily to environmental factors during sensitive periods of developmental plasticity when epigenetic marks undergo modifications. These periods may vary for different tissues, but overall occur during primordial germ cell development,  sperm and eggs aproduction, pre-implantation and early post-implantation, as well as during early<span> childhood and into puberty or beyond (as is for the brain and the reproductive system). </span>It has been shown that changes in the diet, smoking, drugs, and other environmental factors can influence epigenetic remodelling at these times. It would therefore be unsafe to treat patients at these critical times (pregnant women, women considering pregnancy, younger children) as it could cause unpredictable changes in the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
