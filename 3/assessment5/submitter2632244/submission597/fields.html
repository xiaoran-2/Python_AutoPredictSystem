    <div class="field-value"><p><span>: Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</span></p>
<p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells.  This state may</p>
<p>- prevent promoters of oncogenes</p>
<p>- promote correct methylation in introns and intragenic regions</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>: Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</span></p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, methylation of CpG islands may </p>
<p>- promote the expression of oncogenes</p>
<p>- prevent the correct methylation within introns and intragenic regions.</p>
<p>Effectively, the methylation pattern is often reversed in cancers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>: <span>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.</span></p>
<p>Alters genetic expression of cells, which become mitotically heritable and stable - potentially leading simultaneaously to the over-production, and under-destruction of effected daughter-cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>: <span>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span></p>
<p><span>Methylation in the intergenic regions prevents the repeated expression in daughter cells</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>: Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</span></span></p>
<p>Unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements are expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>: Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</p>
<p>An alteration in normal methylation patterns, either hypermethylation, or hypomethylation may lead to</p>
<p>- cells able to withstand normal apoptotic function (Cell imortality)</p>
<p>- deregulation of normal cell function</p>
<p>- increase in growth via cell division</p>
<p>- ability to spread via angiogenisis</p>
<p>Epigenetic mutations may also lead to </p>
<p>- further increases in epigenetic mutation</p>
<p>- tumour promoting inflamation</p>
<p>- evasion of normal immune system responses.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>: Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </span></p>
<p><span>Paternal alleles usually have methylation upstream of the H19 region.  This inhibits the CTCF from binding to the H19 region, which in turn means that downstream enhancers will not act on the H19 region, but rather, will act on Igf2 which will be expressed.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>: <span>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status. </span></span></p>
<p><span>Maternal alleles are unmethylated upstream of the h19 region.  This allows CTCF to bind, and in turn means that downstream enhancers will express the H19.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>: <span>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour. </span></span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumour, the Maternal and Paternal allele are both methylated, which leads to non-expresssion of H19, but more importantly a double dose of Igf2.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>: <span>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The double dose of Igf2 leads to over-expression of cell division, without normal apoptotic (tumour removing) function.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>: <span>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to. </span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine belongs to class of epigenetic inhibitors called <span>DNA-demethylating agents</span></span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>: <span>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine may demethylate the DNA by inhibiting DNS Methyltransferase.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>: Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Decitabine can have an anti tumour effect, by i</span></span></span>nhibiting hyper-methylation in effected cells.</p>
<p><span><span><span> As the demethylation is mitotically heritable, the effect of the treatment is passed on to subsequent generations of daughter cells.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This in turn leads to both an increase in normal function in subsequent generations of cells, by erasing hypermethylation in both the effected gene segment and surrounding regions.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>These surrounding regions may include tumour supressing genes, which in turn make the cells systems normal</span></span></span> apoptotic functions more effective.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>: Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</span></p>
<p><span>Because epigentic modifications are mitotically heritable, and relatively stable, the effects of epigenetic drugs can endure after treatment has ceased.</span></p>
<p><span>If the underlying cause of the disease was epigenetic in nature (as opposed to a genetic mutation), then the mitotic heritability of epigenetic markers means that the effects of the drugs will endure after the treatement period in normal (or improved) cell divisions.</span></p>
<p><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>: <span>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A sensitive period is a time when when epigenetic marks are actively stripped during development.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>: <span>Identify sensitive periods of development.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Genetic reprogramming times - pre-conception, first 8 days before blastocyte forms, and when Sex cells are forming within an embryo.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods may be inadvisable as epigenetic modifications are removed by the normal epigentic reprogramming mechanisms, thus removing the treatment.</span></span></p>
<p>Equally, should the treatment alter chromatin related enzymes such as DNMTs, histone modifiers or chromatin remodelers, this may bring about randomchanges in the epigenome.</p>
<p>Faulty targeting could also lead to accidental changes in the organization of the cell which could in turn cause altered gene expression programs.</p>
