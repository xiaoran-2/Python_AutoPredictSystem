    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation differs between normal cells and tumor cells in humans. The "normal" CpG methylation profile is often inverted in cells that become tumorigenic. In normal cells, CpG islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, but in cancer cells, although CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased, in CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p>CpG island methylation is important in regulation of gene expression, yet cytosine methylation can lead directly to destabilizing genetic mutations and a precancerous cellular state. When mutation results in loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive. Single base pair mutations during replication can also have detrimental effects.Cancer cells can become addicted to the transcriptional silencing, due to promoter hypermethylation, of some key tumor suppressor genes, a process known as epigenetic addiction.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding intergenic regions. Parasitic repetitive sequences, centromeres and oncogenes are often repressed through methylation.</p>
<p>The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less methylcytosine than the genome of a healthy cell. In fact, cancer cell genomes have 20-50% less methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides across the genome. In cancer cells “global hypomethylation” due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases  may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is surmised to have arisen due to the conflicting interests of maternal and paternal genes within a pregnancy.</p>
<p>H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, found in humans and elsewhere. This gene seems to have a role in some forms of cancer. H19 contains a differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region. This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. H19 gene is expressed exclusively in the offspring cell from the maternally inherited allele that is hypomethylated or unmethylated, while the paternal allele H19 is methylated and silent and is not expressed.</p>
<p>H19 and IGF2 expression are closely linked, as they are expressed in the same tissues during fetal development, albeit from differing parental alleles. This coupled expression is only lost in cases of loss of imprinting or promoter mutation.</p>
<p>As methylation of the promoter reaches 100%, H19 expression from that promoter approaches 0. At the same time as H19 expression decreases, the expression of IGF2, a neighboring gene on chromosome 11, increases. The hypermethylation of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele plays a vital role in allowing the expression of the paternal allele of IGF2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (trade name Dacogen) is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia based on DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation is a frequent and specific event during leukemogenesis that is associated with transcriptional gene silencing. DNA methylation events by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition have significant single-agent activity in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) via the DACogen. The effects of this drug lead to induction of gene-specific and global hypomethylation, as well as transcriptional up- and down regulation of multiple genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation and transcriptome effects in myeloblasts AML via DAC-induced DNA methylation (Decitibine) treatement on human tumor indicate decrement in DNA methylation and up-regulate gene expression by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Reduction of DNA methylation turnback on expression of genes down-regulated by hypermethylation, including tumor suppressor genes and genes required for apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns –being involved in addition to mutation– is a possible heritable epigenetic change have been associated with diseases.</p>
<p>Early life is an especially sensitive period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, as environmental signals affect the structure and function of the genome. Thus, although there may certainly be sensitive periods during which plasticity in DNA methylation is heightened (such as during early embryogenesis and fetal development), this epigenetic mechanism appears responsive to environmental experiences occurring across the lifespan.</p>
<p>Influencing experiences-induced DNA methylation patterns of several genes during sensitive periods represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p>Newly development inhibitors for treatment of lymphoma indicates that the amount of histone overmethylation declined dramatically and also reduced the proliferation of tumour cells while, crucially, having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells. These means epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention in a way that genetic mutations are not, that is, they are open to epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way.</p></div>
