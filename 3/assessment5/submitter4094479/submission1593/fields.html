    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two types of DNA-methylation abnormalities: hypermethylation, which is locus specific; and hypomethylation, which is genome wide.The global level of DNA-methylation decreases as we progress from normal tissue to a metastatic tissue. At the same time, it increases in CpG islands. In normal cells, in general we don’t find methylation in CpG islands but in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. On the contrary, in cancer cells we more likely find methylated CpG islands, and non-methylated IR and RE.</p>
<p>CpG islands are mostly located in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. This could be a mechanism by that in normal cells tumors supressors are active and can act. In cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated, inactivating these gens and then the mechanism of control for genome abnormalities isn’t working and cells can divide into other abnormal cells.</p>
<p>This epigenetic modification is frequently in tumors because DNA-methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected. CpG islands are differently hypermethylated in different tumor types: a tumor type might have a different set of CpG islands methylated. We can find CpG islands also in other gens such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT, and by modifying the methylation we do a similar modification than a mutation.</p>
<p>The genome wide hypomethylation is particularly found in 2 contexts: repetitive elements and intergenic regions. It’s very common to happen in cancer cells, more in RE than in IR.</p>
<p>DNA-methylation’s function is to maintain genome stability. In normal cells, recombination between similar chromosomes wouldn’t happen because those are methylated and “heterochromatinized”. Without methylation the chromosome is less density packaged and recombination can occur. Again, cells with abnormalities would divide into more abnormal cells, and this would develop a tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodyseplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. It’s a DNA-dymethylating agent, so it would act on cancers produced by a hypermethylation. As we know, we find hypermethylation in CpG islands in tumor cells by inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. In those cases, Decitabine would dymethylate those CpG islands, activating the tumor suppressor genes, and allowing those suppressors to act on abnormal-genome cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, we have the mathernal allele unmethylated on the imprint control region (ICR) that allows CTCF to bind and act as insulator. That makes that enhancers act on H19 by expressing it and Igf2 will be silenced. But on the paternal allele, ICR is methylated, so enhancers will bind Igf2 and this will be expressed instead of H19.<br />With lost of imprinting we have a lost of methylation on ICR of the mathernal allele. Then, enhancers will bind Igf2 too, as they do on the paternal allele. This results on a double dose of Igf2 and no H19.<br />As Igf2 is a growth promoter, this produces abnormal growth in Wilm's patients. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In some cases, by using the wrong treatment, we can unduring effects. For example, in cases where hypomethylation is the main responsable, we should avoid to use a demethylation drug. <br />We also have to remember that a drug doesn't only affect tumor cells, but also normal cells. In most of cases, this is not a problem because the main goal is the survival of the patient. But we need to remember that treatments have secondary effect and in some cases this is more important to be considered, such as in children or pregnant women.<br />There are sentitive periods on epigenome establishment. Those sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks are established or erased: in primordial germ cells and after fertilisation. In those periods, secondary effects could be worst than main effects. </p></div>
