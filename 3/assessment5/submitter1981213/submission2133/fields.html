    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically found at promoter sites, where transcription machinery binds in order to read a nearby gene. Methylation at these islands prevents expression of the associated genes and is thus said to silence them. Normally, these CpG islands are not methylated. In cancerous cells, however, these CpG islands become methylated. If the associated gene were a tumour suppressor gene, its silencing via the CpG island methylation allows for uncontrolled growth and proliferation of the cell.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, preventing them from moving around the genome or influencing nearby genes with their strong promoters. In cancerous cells, these sites lose their methylation. This disruption enables the otherwise prevented transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombinations.</p>
<p>Thus CpG islands are normally umethylated but become hypermethylated in cancer, which silences genes whose expression would have prevented problematic growth, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated but become hypomethylated in cancer, which enables genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed on only one of two alleles. Disruption can lead to normal expression being doubled (when both alleles express the gene) or completely removed (when both alleles are silenced).</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting control region of the paternal allele is normally methylated. This means it cannot be bound by CTCF; without the CTCF causing blockage, downstream enhancer sites act to express the Igf2 gene. In contrast, the imprinting control region on the maternal allele in normally unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind and insulate Igf2 from expression, thereby forcing the enhancers to instead target and express the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation of the imprinting control region – that is, both the paternal and maternal alleles become methylated. This causes the Igf2 gene to be expressed on both alleles. Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, its overexpression can lead to uncontrolled growth and thus cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means its presence acts to remove methyl groups from DNA, i.e. it brings about hypomethylation. By targeting tumour suppressor genes, decitabine can undo their silencing through demethylation. With their expression restored, the tumour suppressor genes can act to reduce the growth and proliferation of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation can lead to an overexpression of genes or an underexpression of genes. These genes may be epigenetic modifers that go on to have further epigenetic effects. In either case, the change in DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus it is preserved through cell division. This enables the alteration to endure as an influence on the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time during which effects (like from drugs or the environment) occur at all or occur with greater magnitude. Sensitive periods for epigenetic alterations are early embryonic development and particularly germ cell development. Various organs and systems of the body also have their own sensitive periods of development. Treatment during these periods is inadvisable because effects generated here may be permanent and carried throughout the patient's lifetime or even into their offspring.</p></div>
