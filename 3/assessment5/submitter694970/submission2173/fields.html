    <div class="field-value"><p>The functions of the DNA methylation on CpG Island and other CpG dinucleotides is primarily to Silence/Repress Epigenetic Signatures that is found on the genome wide. This is also accompanied with repressive transcription factors domain that leads to silencing. While others DNA methylation is inhibeted and allowed to do transcriptional activity thus Activated or Expressed. In short this may act as a key to allow a certain gene to be exprressed or silenced.</p>
<p>Distrution of DNA Methylation in cancer is <strong><em>highly stimulated</em></strong> on certain areas genome (Control Regions of CpGI's) beacuse of the increase DNMT activity. These leads to silencing. If that gene functions as Tumor suppression activity it can allow the tumor to grow and proliferate.While areas that control Chromosomal Integrity on the Intergenic Regions and Repetitive Regions <em><strong>becomes Hypomethylated</strong> </em>thus allowing their transcripting activity. This leads to further genomic instablity thus allowing mutation.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Factors that Cancer is generated due to Methylation Distruption</em></strong>.</p>
<p>1. DNA Methylation process is highly mutagenic in nature (converts by deamination of cytosine to thymine)</p>
<p>2. Epigenrtic Modification (Viral infections, heavy metals, environmenatal irradiation, cellular stresses, and increase of age) </p>
<p>3. Activation of Proto-Oncogenes</p>
<p>4. Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Genes</p>
<p>5. Chromosomal Instability due to failure DNA Methylation</p>
<p>Contribution to a disease is imminent if DNA Methylation is distrupted siting for example <strong><em>silencing the p15 gene</em></strong>. If the promoters of this gene is Methylated these may allow irregularities on TGF-B that influences the abnormal proliferation of hemapoietic activity. On this case a loss of fuction leads to MDS.</p>
<p><em><strong>A distrupted DNA Methylation on Repetative Elements and Intergenic Regions may allow Chromosomal Instability thru:</strong></em></p>
<p>1. Allowing new illegitimate recombination</p>
<p>2. Activation of multiple repeats</p>
<p>3. Activation of crytic promoters<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-62d538e62f763337ba80d48a/970238/asst-5/970238-52132131b03db0.06274168.jpg" alt="" /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal Allele is usually methylated due to the binding of DNMT 1 de novo synthesis, while Maternal Alelle is un-methylated due to CTCF binding to the CpG's that restrics the DNMT 1 binding. This is critical for genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>1. Maternal Allele Igf2 is silenced  while the H19 gene is expressed (Because the downstream is unmethylated protected by CTCF)</p>
<p>2. Paternal Alllele Igf2 is expressed while the H19 Gene is Silenced (Because the downstream is methylates that is silenced by CH3- via DNMT1)</p>
<p>Insulin growth factor 2 may enhance growth proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis if expressed that may lead to cancer  and that is loss of imprinting (LOI) on this case the wilms tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dacitabine is chemically known 5-ASA-CdR. Its a DNMT Inhibitor that causes de-methylation activity. If a silent gene is de-methylated it can become activated citing for example p15 gene in MDS. This may delay the growth of cancer cells and may response well to other chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Dacitabine causes irreversible covalent bonding to DNMT and DNA thus preventing CH3- to bind at the 5th position of Cytosine (5CpG). Now since it un-methylated, it inhibits MeCP binding thus allowing Transcription Factors like CREB and Pol 2 to bind on the CpG and allow transcription activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Induces cellular differentitation if Tumor supressor gene is Activated</p>
<p>2. Activation of signaling pathways for Apoptosis (p53)</p>
<p>3. Senecense</p>
<p>4. Up-regulation of DNA Repair</p>
<p>5. Angiogenic Factors  be inhibited that prevents collateral blood supply and generation of embolic tumor thus, PREVENTING METASTASIS</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation Modifications as mentioned can affect the signatures of the epigenome wide, thus may silence and or activates depending on the location. This may lead to loss of function or gain function activity.</p>
<p>Sensitive period of development are critical stages where epigenetic signatures that is highly vulnerable DNA Methylation Modification and Reprogramming. </p>
<p><em><strong>1. During Primordial Germ Cell Development</strong></em></p>
<p>a. It can affect the future progeny if De-methylation is exposed during gametogenesis or spermatogenesis. The sperms that is generated that is supposed to be methylated through out the process may become vulnerable for mutation that may risk sterility issues.</p>
<p><em><strong>2. During Pre-Implantation Period of Early Development</strong></em></p>
<p>a. It can affect the fetal growth and its highly teratogenic, because de-methylating activity may reduce methylation activity that should be high after blastocyst stage. These may alter genomic imprinting and X-inactivation features if the progeny is a Female.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5-ASA-CdR intervention management is inadvisable to whom patients who wishes to concieve a new progeny or whom who are pregnant and lastly patients with accquired genetic defects. These patients (with genetic defects)  will further affect survival and due to complication of genetic defect on top with warring effects of the drug which is Myelosupression will surely make the patient die earlier.</p>
