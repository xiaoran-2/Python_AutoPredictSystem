    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer, once thought to be a disease resulting solely from genetic mutation of DNA is now being recognized as being much more complex and more often results from a combination of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities. Indeed epimutations are thought to far more frequent than genetic mutations in cases of cancer.  DNA methylation is facilitated by enzymes called DNA methyltranferases and this DNA methylation is an essential life process, which is required for proper maintenance of functions such as gene expression, chromosome stability and embyogenesis and development.  In normal cells, areas of DNA known as CpG islands (which are very commonly gene promoter regions), are typically not methylated and are associated with the active state of a gene.  Repetitive element and intergenic regions are usually low in CpG elements and tend to be highly methylated.  The methylation of repetitive elements silences non-coding DNA, which is believed to prevent chromosomal instability.  </p>
<p>In contrast, in a cancer cell the CpG islands are methylated typically leading to the inactive state of the gene, while the repetitive element and intergenic regions tend to be hypomethylated, presumably contributing to chromosomal instability.  Cancer also tends to be associated with global hypomethyaltion (reduced methylation)of the genome, which can result in increased genomic instability or the activation of a gene which should be silenced.  Methylation of CpG islands can effect different people to different extents with some presenting hypermethylation of multiple genes while others show minimal change.  Methylation of CpG islands is clearly a critical process, with numerous cancer types having been reported as a consequence of the resulting epigenetic silencing of, for example, kinase inhibitors, DNA repair and programmed cell death mediator genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes, are genes which are expressed from either the maternal or paternal allele, but not both.  Since a significant number of imprinted genes are associated with growth promotion or suppression it is not surprising that loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer cells.  Loss of imprinting can be through either hypermethylation or hypomethylation, depending on the imprint control region and the gene function, which can result in either expression or silencing of both parental alleles simultaneously. </p>
<p>In the case of the Igf2/H19 cluster, usually the paternal allele is methylated, while the corresponding maternal allele is not methylated.  Paternal methylation facilitates Igf2 (growth factor) expression via enhancers, while on the maternal allele the protein molecule CTCF binds to an insulator element which prevents the maternal enhancers acting on Igf2, resulting in  H19 expression instead.  When the H19 cluster on the maternal allele also methylated, CTCF does not bind and Igf2 is expressed from both the maternal and paternal allele resulting in the cell receiving an ‘overdose’ of Igf2.  The double dose of Igf2 , which is a growth promoter, results in a childhood kidney cancer known as Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal regulation of cellular division and growth is often controlled by ‘suppressor genes’ which when expressed correctly control cell division.  Gene expression can be significantly impacted by the methylation of DNA, and where DNA methylation interferes with the normal activity of ‘suppressor genes’ the promotion of cancer can result as a consequence of uncontrolled cell division and growth.  Decitabine is a chemotherapeutic agent, which is described as a ‘hypomethylating agent’.  In other words it prevents or reduces the methylation of DNA.  Decitabine exerts it’s mode of action by acting as an inhibitor of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase, which is a critical enzyme in the DNA methylation process.  By inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine reduces the amount of epigenetic DNA methylation therefore allowing normal function of tumor ‘suppressor genes’.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The process of DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on the epigenome, since methylation marks are propagated through mitosis and any affected genes are permanently silenced or activated.  Sensitive periods of development are those when there is active re-modeling of the genome including the period of primordial germ cell development though to development of mature gametes, and the period of embryo pre-implantation and early post implantation.  During these sensitive periods many environmental factors, for example food, disease and environmental toxins, can influence the epigenome.  In particular, treating people with a drug like Decitabine, which alters the epigenome by restricting methylation, would not be advisable during early pregnancy.  Men being treated with Decitabine are also advised to avoid fathering children during the treatment period, presumably due to the effect of the drug on the proper development of the gametes.  Due to its mechanism of action, Decitabine was found to be teratogenic, fetotoxic, and embryotoxic in preclinical studies in mice and rats and would therefore be expected to pose significant risks in to the potential offspring of males or females being treated with this drug.</p></div>
