    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at some CpG Islands (CGI's) are usually hypomethylated normally, but in cancer the DNA methylation at CGI's are more likely to be methylated. This CGI hypermethylation in cancer is often to silence tumour suppressor genes. As an epimutation it takes advantage of the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, and rapid application of silencing so that it can compete the win against other cells in the tissue, to allow the cells to go on to become a tumour. Repetitive elements, intergenic regions and gene's are usually hypermethylated with healthy normal function, but are usually hypomethylated with abnormal function seen in cancer. Cancer related genome wide hypomethylation most commonly occurs at repetitive regions. Intergenic regions and repeats that are hypomethylated can cause illegitamite recombination, including deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations because the genone is not packed down and instead too accessible.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Imprint Control Region (ICR) in the paternal allele is methlyated and so the enhancers all expression of Igf2, while on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethlyated and CTCF binds to it allowing expression of H19 leaving Igf2 silenced on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methlyated in the maternal allele. The paternal allele retains its methlyated ICR and so a double dose of Igf2 occurs. Igf2 is a growth promotor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA <span>Methyltransferase</span> Inhibitor (DNMTi). This type of drug operates to reduce the expression of growth promotion and therefore reduce cancerour cell proliferation and tumour growth. These drugs are cell division dependant in their action, and so cancer cells are more severly affected by DNMTi - but correct dosage is important to achieve an acceptable anti-neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because these changes are mitotically heritable until they are erased such as during the sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are when DNA methlyation is erased from and recreated onto the maternal and paternal genome's. There are two organism wide sensitive periods; the early embryonic development period between the embryo implantation through to the epiblast, and the germ cell development period between the primoridal germ cell development and the production of mature eggs or sperm. Some organ's also have brief sensitive periods depending on how that organ develops. Treatment during the sensitive periods can cause a mistake in epigenetic programming and produce an uncorrected error which might cause disease.</p></div>
