    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA can be methylated at cytosines, which almost exclusively belong to a CpG dinucleotide in mammals, by proteins called DNA methyltransferases. We refer to CpG islands (CGIs) as regions with greater proportion of CpG dinucleotides than expected by chance. These CGIs usually occur in promoter regions and tend to be protected from methylation. However, promoter CGI methylation is universally associated with gene expression silencing, which gives DNA methylation a status of inactive epigenetic mark. The silencing can be achieved by different mechanisms, such as methylated CpG binding of MeCP proteins or blocking of transcription factors. In cancer, CGIs were found to be hypermethylated. Although the pattern of CGI hypermethylation can differ by tumour type, it is generally associated with silencing of tumour suppressor genes. These genes usually have activating/repressing roles on pathways related to cell cycle and/or promote apoptosis. It is recognized that the silencing of tumour suppressors genes by hypermethylation of CGIs (within promoter regions) can be one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>Differently from CGIs, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated genome-wide in normal cells. It is believed that this feature would maintain genomic integrity, which can be achieved by silencing cryptic TSS/splice sites, or even by protecting the genome from transposable elements. It was found that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are, to some extent, hypomethylated in all tumour types tested, and that this condition, as in CGIs hypermethylation, progesses with tumorigenicity. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements contributes to the disease by creating genomic instability which leads to a cell with abnormal karyotype. More specifically, the instability may arise from incorrect recombination between repeat-rich regions, the activation of such repeats with posterior translocation and, as mentioned above, the activation of cryptic promoters leading to aberrant expression of co-located genes. Finally, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters may lead to the direct activation of oncogenes or activation of ncRNAs which target tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster, located in chromosome 11, is a paternally imprinted cluster. In the paternal allele, its Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated, disallowing the binding of the insulator CTCF – a transcription factor in which one of the functions is enhancer-blocking. Consequently, the enhancers located downstream of the HG19 locus are able to perform their preferred DNA loop in order to activate expression of Igf2 gene. In addition, the methylation spreads from the ICR to the HG19 gene, silencing its expression. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, enabling CTCF binding. This factor blocks the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 gene, resulting in its downregulation. Also, the blocked enhancers will alternatively act on HG19, upregulating this gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, both maternal and paternal alleles HG19/Igf2 cluster’s ICRs are methylated. In this case, the insulator CTCF is prevented from binding at the maternal allele’s ICR, changing the maternal allele’s expression pattern to be such as in the paternal allele. As a result, Igf2 is expressed on both alleles, i.e. the organism will receive a double dose of that gene. Since Igf2 encodes a member of the insulin family of polypeptide growth factors, its overexpression contributes to Wilm’s tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabin, which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class. This hypomethylating agent decreases genomic levels of DNA methylation by inhibiting DNMT enzymes. This drug’s mechanism of action starts upon replication. In this period, Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA, since it is a nucleoside analogue. Afterwards, when the DNMT comes along to perform its function, it binds to the drug irreversibly. Consequently, the DNMT dose drops, while the number of unmethylated sites increase. Since this procedure depends on DNA replication and cancerous cells divide faster than normal cells, DNMTis' impact should be higher in tumours. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by activating tumour suppressor genes which were previously silenced with methylation marks. Furthermore, patients suffering from haematological malignancies, which are known to be associated with tumour suppressor inactivation, present higher life span and better life quality after Decitabine is administered. However, its anti-tumour effect and its long-term consequences are still not very clear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. On the one hand, double-strand methylated DNA becomes hemi-methylated DNA after cell division, i.e. only one strand is methylated. The DNMT1 is able to recognize hemi-methylated sites and restore the original methylation status. Therefore, DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable (stable) mark. On the other hand, when the action of DNMT1 is blocked, DNA suffers a passive demethylation. In this process, DNA methylation is diluted with every cell division since hemi-methylated sites are not recovered by DNMT1.</p>
<p>The term ‘sensitive period’ defines the stages of development in which the epigenetic marks are being established, rather than maintained. Well-known sensitive periods occur during embryonic development: at early and primordial germ-cell stages. Additionally, studies have suggested post-natal sensitive periods. One example is the Dutch famine studies, in which under-nutrition and low birth weight correlate with complications such as obesity and CVD in adults. Another example would be the Overkalix study, in which a possible transgenerational epigenetic inheritance was described concerning the correlation between increased grandparental food supply and decrease in grandchild’s longevity. In summary, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since epigenetic marks are being constantly reprogrammed and altered environment may have a great impact on these individuals’ development.</p></div>
