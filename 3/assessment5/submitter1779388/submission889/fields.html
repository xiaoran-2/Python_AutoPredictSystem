    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Introduction: DNA Methylation</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues and it is essential for normal development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Normal Function of CGI</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpGs are often grouped in clusters called <em>CpG islands (CGI)</em>, which are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes. Usually they are unmethylated allowing the expression of adjacent genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG Island in cancer</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. If the silenced gene is a tumour suppressor, it allows the tumour growth. Alterations of DNA methylation is an important component of cancer development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>- Silencing of repeat to prevent transposition</p>
<p>- Mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition</p>
<p>- Silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters</p>
<p>- Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In cancer, the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome wide lack of methylation. Hypomethylation, in general, is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. This occurs to some degree in all tumour types and progress with tumorigenicity. The consequence depends on location.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Contribution to disease of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hypomethylation causes genomic instability through three known mechanisms:</p>
<p>- Ilegitimate recombination between repeats</p>
<p>- Activation of repeats and transposition</p>
<p>- Activation of cryptic promoters and disruptive to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes</p>
<p>This is a common early event, often seen in preneoplastic tissue</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>H19/Igf2 cluster: enhancer blocking</strong></p>
<p>H19/igf2 cluster involves several genes. it includes the Igf2 gene, the CTCF protein binding site, H19 promoter, and the enhancers needed to activate the Igf2 gene. The paternal and maternal alleles are differentially methylated allowing a precise control of igf2 expression</p>
<p>CTCF is an insulator protein and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers</p>
<p><strong>Paternal Allele</strong></p>
<p>DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF</p>
<p>Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access IGf2 to activate</p>
<p><strong>Maternal allele</strong></p>
<p>In normal cells the maternal allele is not methylated, CTCF binds to maternal allele and H19 can be expressed and the enhancers cannot activate the Igf2</p>
<p><strong>Wilms tumour</strong></p>
<p>In wilms tumour the maternal allele is also methylated , the H19 will be silenced and the enhancer will activate the maternal allele igf2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Contribution to disease</strong></p>
<p>The overexpression of igf2 that is an oncogen or growth promoter increases cells grow in an abnormal pattern causing the tumour</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Decitabine</strong> , or <strong>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</strong>, is a drug for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemically, it is a cytidine analog.</p>
<p><strong>Epigenetic Inhibitor: DNMT inhibitor</strong></p>
<p>Decitabine is a  hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It binds DNMTs after they are incorporated in DNA and therfore it is relication dependent.</p>
<p> Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> As a hypomethylating agent, Decitabine reduce DNA methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Antitumor effect</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> In many tumours some regions from DNA as CpGIslands are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation avoids the expression of tumour suppressor genes and the tumour can proliferate. If decitabine avoids hypermethylation the tumour suppressor genes can be expressed and the tumour growth can be controlled. In adequate dose it has an antineoplastic effect</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In some diseases, like cancer, the epigenome is altered and the expression of tumour suppressor genes is silenced or oncogens are overexpressed. This fact has been used with diagnosis and prognosis purposes. Recently some drugs have been also approved with therapeutic purposes that target these epigenetic alterations. These drugs in the adequate dose improve the patient state but they could have live long lasting secondary effects.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Epigenomic Drugs </strong></p>
<p>Epigenome is mitotically heritable, so any alteration in DNA methylation will be maintained during mitosis and its effects will last beyond the period of drug treatment</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods </strong></p>
<p>Sensitive periods in epigenomics are when altered environments have an effect on epigenomic control.</p>
<p>Inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression patterns from parents to offspring by passage through the germ cells is not explained by genetic differences. This suggests that epigenetic marks are transmitted from parents to offspring</p>
<p>In Sensitive period any epigenomic change could be inherited in next generations.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods of development</strong></p>
<p>Sensitive period are in the early development stage, during pregnancy and also in the period where the germ cells are maturing, adolescence. Any alteration in sensitive periods could affect the epigenome of next generations.</p>
