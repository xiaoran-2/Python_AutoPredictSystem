    <div class="field-value"><p>      DNA methylation is critical to survival of organisms because it represents one important means for cells to control which genes are expressed and which are silenced. The CpG islands of normal cells are usually unmethylated, allowing transcription factors to bind to the promoters, and subsequently allowing the expression of the associated gene. A good example of this is tumor-suppressor genes which, in their normal state, contain unmethylated CpG islands and are therefore expressed. In cancer, however, the CpG islands found in the promotors of tumor-suppressor genes become hypermethylated, which silences these genes in a mitotically heritable way. This happens because of abberations in certain epigenetic controls such as the mutation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), TET proteins, chromatin remodellers and others, and it is locus-specific. These epimutations are often selected for, and can overwhelm normal cells.</p>
<p>     Normally, the intergenic regions and repetitve elements are heavily methylated. Intergenic methylation maintains the integrity of the normal karyotype, and repetitive element methylation prevents the repeats from disruptively jumping around the genome. However, in cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (meaning that gene expression is allowed to take place), which can cause potentially disasterous genomic instability including deletions, insertions, duplication, and reciprocal translocations of individual bases or groups of bases within the genome. Again, this incorrect methylation is largely caused by mutations in many epigenetic regulators, including DNMT, methyl-binding proteins and others. An example of a mistake in methylation which could lead to disease might be a mutated DNMT. Since DNMT is required to methylate new DNA strands during cell division, an abberation that prevents DNMT from performing this function could contribute to disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     Decitabine is classed as an azanucleoside (nucleoside analog) and works as a DNA-demethylating agent. Although the drug's mode of action in humans has not been clearly defined, <em>in vitro</em> studies have shown that Decitabine is directly incorporated into DNA, and by creating bonds between itself and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), it inhibits the function of DNMT and consequently also inhibits DNA methylation in rapidly dividing cells. Decitabine may also induce apoptosis of abnormal cells.</p>
<p>    <em> In vitro</em> studies have demonstrated that Decitabine can reverse epigenetic mutations which causes gene silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (caused by hypermethylation of its promoters). As a result, more normal function can be restored to tumor-suppressor genes. Expression of these genes then allows them to perform their normal anti-tumor function by preventing uncontrolled tumor growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to the function of DNMT1, which recognizes a hemi-methylated substrate following cell division and then maintains the methylated state in the daughter strands. Because of this mitotic heritability, it is possible for DNA methylation to affect the epigenome long-term, and therefore it is also possible for drug-induced changes in DNA methylation to be stable and long lasting. Indeed, it is during these stable maintenance periods that epigenetic drug treatment is appropriate. </p>
<p>     However, there are two time periods in the life of an organism during which DNA methylation can be cleared (removed). These are called "sensitive periods," and they exist both in the very early development of the zygote and in the development of the primordial germ cells. It would not be advisable to administer epigenetic drug treatments during these sensitive periods because, first, the efficacy of the outcome would likely be uncertain due to clearing and resetting, and second, there would be the potential for damage to the rapidly dividing and differentiating cells of the developing embryo or the specialized germ cells, i.e. treating a patient with epigenetic drugs could potentially affect his or her future generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     The maternal and paternal alleles both contain H19/Igf2 clusters, but in normal cells these genes are each expressed differently due to imprinting. Maternally, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated, which allows a protein called CTCF to bind to the ICR. As a result, the downstream enhancers are insultated from acting on Igf2, which renders it silent. Instead, the enhancers act to express H19. H19 codes for a long non-coding RNA and its purpose seems to be to regulate the expression of Igf2. On the paternally imprinted allele however, the ICR is methylated, which prevents the CTCF protein from binding and therefore allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, which is then expressed. Additionally, the paternal H19 is methylated, silencing it.</p>
<p>     In Wilm's tumor, H19 is inactivated in the maternal allele and the normally silent maternal Igf2 is expressed, which leads to biallelic Igf2 expression (since paternal Igf2 is already expressed). This problem is likely due to maternal imprint disruption in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster. In addition to Wilm's tumor, these imprint errors can also lead to other diseases such as gigantism and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
