    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, hypomethylation exists at CpG islands. Conversely methylation occurs at introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This is contrasted with cancerous cells, where a “reciprocal cross” exists, i.e., opposite to the above state. The disruption of CpG islands in cancerous cells typically occurs in the promotor region of tumor suppressor genes, varies between tumor types, and increases with time and tumor growth. This hypermethylation creates an epigenetic silencing, thereby locking the region into silent inactive state that is mitotically heritable. The hypomethylation that occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the latter being most common, creates genomic instability through “illegitimate recombination” events between repetitive elements (deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes of cancer cells commonly demonstrate a loss of imprinting, i.e., genes are expressed in a parent of origin specific pattern. Changes in methylation occur at ICRs (imprint control regions), thereby allowing for either expression or suppression from both parental alleles. In the normal situation, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated in the latter situation, CTCF binds to the maternal ICR, leading to the enhancers to bind to H19 and silencing of IGF2 and lack of expression. The converse is true of the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, you have methylation of both maternal and paternal ICRs, thereby allowing for expression of of IGF2 from both parental alleles, a disruption of the normal imprinting process. As IGF2 is a growth-promotor, cellular growth is abnormally enhanced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog, cytidine being one of the four RNA nucleosides. It is in the class of drugs referred to as DNA methylators, and functions to hypomethylate DNA by blocking DNMT, one of a class of enzymes responsible for methylating DNA (specifically, it blocks DNA synthesis at the intra-S-phase of cell division (<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?CdrID=39299">http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?CdrID=39299</a>). In doing so, it functions to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes, thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth (Modes of action of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine.  Stresemann, C &amp; Lyko, F. IJC, Vol23, Issue 1.pp.8–13. July 2008).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin’s belief that “"epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy" was based on the finding that a combination of epigenetic drugs that affect the histone proteins (histone-deacetylase inhibitors) and DNA-methylating agents improved outcomes in individuals with lung cancer who were subsequently treated with routine chemotherapeutic agents. Given that epigenetics fundamentally affects genetic changes that are inheritable because they work during mitosis, it would be logical they would therefore have an “enduring effect” on the epigenome by being passed through generations until effectively erased from the daughter cells. Sensitive periods exist when altered environments may affect epigenetic control, such as seen post-fertilization and prior to implantation of the blastocyst, and during primordial germ cell development (see Week 5). Using epigenetic therapeutic agents during these periods would adversely affect the epigenome, thereby affecting the genome for subsequent cellular differentiation.</p></div>
