    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are commonly disrupted in cancer via changes in DNA methylation; either hyper or hypo methylation on both alleles. Imprinted genes are associated with cell growth, and normally have either a maternal or paternal allele methylated (known as the imprinted allele) to either promote or silence a gene, preventing two copies of the same gene from being expressed. In the case of Wilm's Tumor, a rare kidney cancer, the region identified to be abnormal and promotoing of the tumor is an imprinted gene cluster known as H19/Igf2. In normal cells, the paternal copy of the gene is imprinted and methylated, and enhances transcription of the Igf2 gene which is growth (and potentially tumor) promoting. The maternal allele is non-methylated, and blocks enhancers from Igf2 via CTCF to promote the transcription of gene H19 instead. Therefore, only one copy of the Igf2 gene is promoted and growth occurs in a regulated fashion. In Wilm's tumor, instead of only methylation of the paternal allele, the maternal allele is also methylated, leading to reduced binding of CTCF and reduced expression of H19 leading to enhancement just like in the paternal allele of Igf2. This overexpression of Igf2 leads to enhanced growth of the cell and eventually the hallmark of the disease, Wilm's Tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that affects DNA through directly or indirectly modifying chromatin structure, histones, and DNA regions themselves to either promote or silence genes in a complex and integrative way. In normal tissue, DNA methylation is usually present on cytosine dinucleotides, and genomic regions such as introns, exons, and repeats, and the methylation tends to silence these regions. At CpG islands, these cytosines instead tend to be unmethylated and associated with active promotion of genes. So in normal tissue, DNA methylation is associated with silencing of exons, introns, repeats, and individual cytosines, all of which could potentially interfere with gene function, and the hypomethylation of CpG islands tend to be promoting of genomic activity. </p>
<p>In cancerous cells, the exact opposite methylation states tend to be seen. CpG islands tend to be more methylated, and these intergenic regions of exons, introns, and repeats sometimes known as "junk" DNA are hypomethylated. The consequence to the cell is immense. CpG islands tend to be found at promoters of tumor suppressant genes. When these islands are methylated, their corresponding tumor suppressant genes are not promoted and transcribed. The net effect is less regulation of growth of the cell, which is a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p>Similarly, the widespread areas of exons, introns and repeats that should be methylated and hence silenced are generally hypomethylated in cancer, which has a few disastrous effects. These regions can interfere with normal cell function when they are not silenced, and they can transpose, insert, delete, silence or promote genes. They can cause point mutations, and generally interfere with normal cell function, making cancerous changes much more likely. This hypomethylation also decreases the stability of the genome, making DNA repair more difficult. All of these changes promote cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor or DNA de-methylating agent, and is used to treat blood cancers. For example, in myelodyplastic syndrome, tumor suppressor genes have been identified that are silenced through increased methylation of histone proteins. DNMT inhibitors combat this methylation through either active or passive demethylation of these histones, thereby allowing previously silenced tumor suppressor genes to be active either presently or in the next generation. DNMT in normal cells is critical to maintaining the hypermethylated state and the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation, allowing the daughter strand to be methylated like the parent strand and thereby passing on the methylation state of the cell. When Decitabine is added and DNMT is inhibited, this methylation of the daughter strand does not occur, as well as not allowing maintenance of methylation in parent DNA. An anti-tumor effect is seen as the hypermethylated, silenced genes are demethylated and the methylation state of these histones is not conserved in the daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation in particular is mitotically heritable through DNMTs, it's not surprising that epigenetic drugs could alter tumor cells in a lasting way. Besides the obvious function of changing gene expression through methylation, thereby altering the cell, these alterations can be permanent through DNMT and methylation of the daughter strands during replication. In cancer, those treated cells could be made more susceptible to other cancer drugs, through more binding sites, more open chromatin structure, or more accessible damaged regions. For instance, an important factor for drug efficacy is access to the damaged DNA, and methylated heterochromatin is densely packaged and out of reach for most drugs. If a DNMT inhibitor is added and methylation is decreased, presumably the chromatin structure will open up allowing another drug to now reach its target and suppress the tumor growth.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one where epigentic marks are being laid down or removed, and this usually occurs during preimplantation of the embryo and during gametogenesis. During these times, adding drugs that affect epigenetic marks could have a detrimental effect on the normal function of the cells and ultimately the person being formed. Epigenetic marks effect the expression of the entire genome and improper marks are widely associated with diseases. Cancer could inadvertantly be promoted in the next generation through the gametes.</p></div>
