    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation covers different topics and aspects in the gene control along mammalian development. This modification in the genetic code in mammalians affect the c5 position of citosine that is an important part of CpG dinucleotides. the DNA methylation is removed with especific mechanisms during embryonic development but is repositioned in the development of the individual; when mammalian have a disease like cancer the epigenetic mechanisms could be altered include the CpG islands methylation. In cancer, the CpG islands are often hypermethylated and CpG methylation of oncogenes promoter region and transposons or repetitive regions are hypomethylated, but the cancer is not only the one disease, in different diseases we could find peculiarities in comparison with a healthy cells because the gene promoter in CpG islands take abnormal hypermethylation and it become in transcriptional silencing which the genetic material have mutations.</p>
<p><span>Hypermethylation of gene promoters that i already mentioned can result in silencing of tumor suppresor gene<span> promoters</span>. This epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.</span></p>
<p>Now i begin to explain what happen in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements and them mechanisms. Mainly the functions that this regions have are maintain genomic integrity ; in the case of repetitive regions this have a particular task because this regions can jump out and can put itself in anywhere in the genome, which allow that this regions could make differents mutations around the genome. However, hypomethylation of CpG, that i already mentioned happen when the healthy cells become in cancer cells in other parts in the genome could produce variability and instability in the genome because the mechanism is a loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.</p>
<p>With the knowledge of the mechanism and the comparison between a healthy cell and cells with different diseases, its posible find ways to attack the epigenetic anomalies. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The article that have been proposed explain how differents drugs could be serve as a treatment to combat the various abnormalities that were mentioned in the first question knowing that these could be inherited.</p>
<p>Decitabine is one of those drug which belong to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, also belongs to <span>antimetabolites similar to the subtances in the cell</span> ; <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">according to the different investigations about decitabine in several articles published in the network is found that this drug may have a success rate of 17-49% in myelodysplastic syndrome in multiple phase II and III studies and also activity in acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><span>One of mainly functions of decitabine is its ability to specifically and potently inhibit DNA methylation the process responsible for regulating the genetic expression,<span> and this drug work <span>is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</span> </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The alterations in the DNA methylation allow anomalies presented in the epigenetics of mammals are inherited to the next 2 generations and these mutations occur in the genetic code thus giving different diseases.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the DNA replication cycle sensitive periods are called so because they are </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> periods of dynamic reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during gametogenesis and embryogenesis may also present the so that the environment can act on them on the developing embryo to alter the normal process of establishing DNA methylation (and other epigenetic) patterns</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">. Such changes in DNA methylation patterns could affect normal patterns of gene expression or alter genome stability, thereby leading to an increased risk of diseases later in life, even if these changes in methylation occur in only a subset of cells of a given tissue.</span></p>
<p><span>Is important that the methylation activity renewed because preservation of  DNA methylation is very important after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the D</span>NA methyltransferase<span> (DNMT) especially DNMT1 which is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication; the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, consequently, would lead to passive demethylation ; because of that it would be possible treating patients. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes have and imprinted region in the middle, when the maternal allele is unmethylated it mean that is paternally imprinted and the patternal allele is methylated; the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome, in the matternal allele could find </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">CTCF that is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream ; and in both alleles at the end we could find the </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">enhancers like</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> DNA methylation at ICR blocks which  binding of CTCF binding , however, </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate, (this part was found in the video lectures).</span></p>
<p>In this case when i study the comparison between a healthy cell that have the maternal allele unmethylated and a Wilm's tumour that is with have an hypermethylation of imprint control regions , this cancer cells display loss of imprinting genes that could be expressed both alleles or silent from both alelles.</p>
<p>so when the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated it show that have dose of lgf2 it mean in this case that both alleles could expresed, consequently, that <span>is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour</span>.</p>
