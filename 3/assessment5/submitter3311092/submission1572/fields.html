    <div class="field-value"><pre>The methylation of DNA refers to the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-carbon(C5) position of cytosine bases that are located 5'to a guanosine base in CPG dinucleotide. DNA methylation plays an important role in different cellular processes including gene expression, silencing of transposable elements ,and defense against viral sequences . Importantly ,aberrant DNA methylation is tightly connected to a wide variety of human cancer. DNA methylation is mediated by enzymes DNA methyl transferases(DNMTs) among which DNMT1  is the principal enzyme in mammals responsible for post-replicative methylation (known as maintenance of DNA methylation ) , and DNMT3A&amp;3B are responsive for methylation of new CPG sites (de novo methylation ) .The levels and patterns of DNA methylation undergo dramatic change during embryonic development ,starting with a wave of a profound demethylation during the cleavage stage and followed by a widespread de Nove methylation after embryo implantation stage, Interestingly, in contrast to the maternal genome , which is only partially demethylated after fertilization . Recent studies indicated that during early embryonic development the promoter methylation is accompanied by specific histone modifications that are typical of heterochromatin , and that abnormal epigenetic premarking during early embryonic development may predispose certain genes to cancer promoting DNA methylation event.<br /></pre></div>

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

IGF2 gene is 8837bp, there are nine exons and 8 introns. In exon 9, it has ApaⅠrestriction sites of polymorphic enzyme. Reverse gene imprinting of IGF2 and H19 genes expressed only in origin of paternal allele. IGF2 in kidney and liver of complete hydatidiform are expressed in paternal allele. IGF2 are also showed imprinting status in humans. All IGF receptor genes are also in imprinting status, IGF1R is paternal imprinted genes, IGF2R is maternally imprinted genes.<br /> IGF2 as a regulator of polypeptide and tumor development are closely related. Self- secretion of IGF2 is the primary mode of the growth of certain tumor cells, its paracrine function are major growth mode of stromal tumors such as breast cancer. IGF2 levels of tumor in microenvironment may have high in the following mechanisms: loss of imprinting loss of heterozygosity, enhanced transcription activity, loss of transcriptional suppressor or changes of IGF2 binding protein. High-level expression of IGF2 are common in childhood tumors such as Wilms tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and liver cell tumor, as well as breast cancer. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is <span class="short_text" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">DNA</span> <span class="hps">methyltransferase</span></span> inhibitor phosphatase.It has to treat myelodysplastic syndrome effect. When Decitabine is phosphorylated which has directly effect on DNA, to control the contribution of inhibition of DNA methyl-transferase, so that ensure DNA hypomethylation, cells are split and dead.</p>
<p>Demethylation drugs can activate genes of tumor suppressor, and enhance to differentiate genes, it is possible to achieve the purpose of treatment of MDS. After Decitabine is phosphorylated, it plays the role of the anti-tumor effect. It has a direct effect on DNA, inhibit contribution of DNA methyltransferase, so that it can cause the DNA hypomethylation and to make the cells dead. Decitabine inhibit DNA methylation in vitro, but it does not affect DNA hypomethylation. It can lead to demethylation of tumor cells and restore normal function of genes, which can control cell differentiation and proliferation is very important. However, nonproliferative cells are insensitive to decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p>Evidence is emerging that several diseases and behavioral pathologies result from defects in gene function. The best-studied example is cancer, but other diseases such as autoimmune disease, asthma, type 2 diabetes, metabolic disorders, and autism display aberrant gene expression. Gene function may be altered by either a change in the sequence of the DNA or a change in epigenetic programming of a gene in the absence of a sequence change. With epigenetic drugs, it is possible to reverse aberrant gene expression profiles associated with different disease states. Several epigenetic drugs targeting DNA methylation and histone deacetylation enzymes have been tested in clinical trials. Understanding the epigenetic machinery and the differential roles of its components in specific disease states is essential for developing targeted epigenetic therapy.But I worry that instead of resetting epigenetic patterns, the primary drug being tested simply kills cells, whether cancerous or healthy ones, and therefore has toxic side effects. Precisely how the treatment works isn't yet known. And because drugs that remove methyl groups from DNA can potentially switch on hundreds of genes in healthy cells, including known oncogenes, there is concern that the drugs could cure one kind of cancer but cause another.</p></div>
