    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs on CpG dinucleotides, which are found at CpG Islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The CpG islands are generally gene promotors; methylation there silences the gene. In normal tissues, this allows the cell to turn off the genes which are unnecessary for its function, like haemoglobin in neurons. At intergenic regions, DNAme silences cryptic promotors which would cause DNA to be transcribed anti-sense, as well as repetitive elements, which prevents their transposition and so maintains genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer, two contradictory changes occur. On the one hand, the CpG islands and Imprint Control Regions are often hypermethylated, while on the other hand the rest of the genome is hypomethylated. In the first case, the abnormal CpG islands are often at promotors of tumour suppressors: hypermethylation suppresses the suppresor genes, allowing their oncogenes to be expressed and promote uncontrolled growth. The hypermethylation doesn't stay within the island: it can spread along its shores for 2 kb, affecting more genes. In the case of ICRs, the effect varies with how the ICR works: hypermethylation could cause the overexpression of an oncogene, or the suppression of a tumour suppressor.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rest of the genome is hypomethylated. This allows repetitive elements like LINEs to "jump" to other parts of the genome, often inserting themselves in the middle of other genes and disrupting their function, and generally destabalising the genome. Illegitimate recombinations, insertions, deletions all disrupt the normal function of the genome.</p>
<p>Another consequence is that the genes of some non-coding RNAs are no longer methylated and are expressed. They can then go on to silence tumour suppressor genes and contribute to cancer in this way: an example would be miR21 silencing PTEN.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR for the H19/IGF2 cluster is found on human chromosome 11, and is imprinted: it is methylated and silenced at the paternal allele, but not the maternal one. IGF2, or Insulin-like Growth Factor 2, promotes cell growth and proliferation. It is located furthest upstream; then comes the ICR, then H19, then the enhancers.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and so the protein CTCF is able to bind to it. CTCF insulates (protects) the IGF2 gene from the effects of the enhancers. Therefore, IGF2 is not transcribed. The enhancers work instead on H19, causing it to be transribed.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and CTCF can no longer bind. Without the insulator in place, the enhancers can act on IGF2, causing it to be transcribed, and ultimately translated into IGF2 protein.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, a genetic or epigenetic mutation prevents methylation/CTCF binding on the maternal allele, so the cell effectively has two paternal copies. It has twice the normal dose of IGF2 protein, which causes increased and uncontrolled proliferation - this is a tumour.</p>
<p>This can also result from uniparental disomy - inheriting two chromosome 11s from the father.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzyme inhibitor: it reduces the activity of DNMT1. Decitabine has a simililar structure to cystidine, and is incorporated into DNA in replication. When DNMT1 reaches it, it binds irreversibly to the enzyme, stopping its activity. Thus, the DNAme maintenance is disabled, and as the cancer cells divide, the level of DNA methylation is diluted out.</p>
<p>This results in an anti-tumour effect because the tumour being treated happens to be driven by hypermethylation. The promotors of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, so that the suppressors have decreased expression and therefore the oncogenes have increased expression. Decitabine acts to reduce this methylation back to normal levels.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. After division, each daughter cell has methylation on one strand of its double helices (inherited from the parent cell) and none on the complementary strand (made during mitosis). DNMT1 methylates the complementary strand. Thus, methylation is maintained across cell generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs: methylation is cleared and reset as appropriate for the cell lineage. Because the entire genome (almost) is being reprogrammed, the organism is particularly sensitive to environmental influences: they could permanently change its epigenome, throughout the body. For example, giving methyl donors like alcohol during these periods will have a profound effect on phenotype and health.</p>
<p>The two sensitive periods during development are the pre-implantation period, and primordial germ cell development (around E13.5). There also seems to be another around or just before the onset of puberty, when the germ cells are maturing (8-9 years old for boys, as evidenced by cohort studies of childhood smoking). Using epigenetic drugs during these periods could have widespread and unpredictable effects on their epigenomes. It could disrupt vital metabolic mechanisms throughout their bodies (the worst part is, we don't know which) - and it would be permanent.</p></div>
