    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated which results in gene silencing and especially inactivates tumour suppressor cells leading to cancer cell proliferation. In normal cells, CpG islands are methylated which is a requirement in mammals for normal embryonic development and for maintaining genomic stability. Intergenic regions allow physical association of chromatin remodelling complexes resulting in differentiation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption can lead to overexpression of Igf2 and silencing of growth restricting hormones which lead to extreme proliferation of cancer cells. This is seen in Wilm's tumour. In normal cells, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is hypomethylated and Igf2 is silenced but in cancer cells, this control region is silent. Due to loss of imprinting there is  hypermethylation of Igf2 on the maternal allele. Therefore, there is over expression of Igf2 and increased growth promotion leading to Willm's tumour. Igf2 is normally expressed on the paternal allele and if the imprint control region on the maternal allele becomes hypomethylated then there is a double dose of Igf2 expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, a demethylating transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). They are incorporated into the DNA and DNMTi binds irreversibly DNMT after they are incorporated into the DNA. This binding prevents the cells from replicating. Cancer cells are affetcted as they are not able to repricate at such high rates as they would normally be. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are most vulnerable to alteration and so any influence from DNA methylation induced drug treatment can and adverse effects. Treating patients at these times would be in advisable as they changes in epigenetic marks in germ cells could be passed to grandchildren. </p></div>
