    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are located at gene promoters and are demethylated, providing euchromatin which allows the machinery of transcription to access promoter DNA.<br /><br />Cancer's hypermethylation of CGIs is progressive, silencing gene promoters. A single gene may be silenced or, in Long-Range Epigenetic Silencing, a megabase-length methylation layer may silence many genes. DNA-methylation spreading may extend beyond CGIs to silence genes in the two kilobases "shores" on either side. <br /><br />Cancer results when DNA hypermethylation of CGIs causes the mitotically heritable silencing of genes involved in tumor suppression. Hypermethylation of CGIs often leads to loss of imprinting. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, and their mis-expression is oncogenic. <br /><br />If a gene promoter regulating epigenetic enzymes is hypermethylated, the enzymes' altered function could cause further methylation silencing of tumor suppressors.<br /><br /><br />CpG loci are methylated at intergenic regions, protecting the genome from transposable elements and maintaining genomic stability. DNA methylation at repetitive elements suppresses transcriptional activity and silences strong promoters.<br /><br />Progressive, genome-wide hypomethylation begins in cancer's early stages. Euchromatic, methylation-depleted intergenic regions are subject to illegitimate recombination between genomic regions sharing a genetic similarity. Intergenic euchromatin causes deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translations between chromosomes. <br /><br />Genome hypomethylation in cancer leaves repetitive elements in a euchromatic state. Without methylation suppressing the promoter, repetitive elements can activate, make copies of themselves, jump and transpose elsewhere into the genome. The coding region of genes may be interrupted, causing transcriptional aberrations and potentially activating neighboring genes. Unsilenced CpGs of strong promoters cause downstream transcriptional interference.<br /><br />Hypomethylation of repetitive elements in cancer unsilences cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites, interfering with gene transcription. <br /><br />Genes silenced by severing may lead to a loss of tumor suppression, or control over cell death, angiogenesis, proliferative signaling, and other crucial defenses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated. DNA methylation-spreading silences the H19 promoter, and Igf2 can access downstream enhancers. H19 suppression governs Igf2 expression.<br /><br />The maternal allele is unmethylated. The imprint control region provides binding sites for CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from accessing the downstream enhancers. The H19 promoter is unmethylated, and H19 transcribes a long non-coding RNA, suppressing Igf2 expression.<br /><br />Wilms' tumor is an embryonal or childhood kidney cancer, in which the maternal allele is methylated and behaves like the paternal allele. H19 is suppressed on each allele while Igf2 is expressed from both.  <br /><br />A loss of maternal imprinting favors the development of larger offspring. Igf2 is an oncogene, and its elevated expression is growth-promoting.  <br /><br />If Wilms' tumor is the result of loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 control locus, imprint disruption at the nearby Kcnq1 ICR must also have occurred, as outlined in our lectures on Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome.<br /><br />Cdkn1c tumor suppressor transcription is also silenced by L.O.I. at the Kcnq1 ICR. That loss, coupled with the oncogenicity of the over-expressed Igf2 results in a cancer rate far greater than seen in children without Beckwith-Wiedemann.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, Decitamine is a nucleoside analog, incorporating into DNA and binding to DNA methyltransferase upon transcription. DNMT's diminished activity causes a less-than-faithful duplication of late-replicating, heterochromatic DNA methylation marks. The loss of these epimarks is mitotically heritable. At therapeutic doses, Decitabine-induced hypomethylation at CpG islands is observed in the faster-replicating cells of cancer. <br /><br />Epigenetic therapies which strip methylation to reactivate suppressed genes can restore the cell's abilities to suppress tumors, induce cell death, halt tumor angiogenesis, restore proliferative signaling, disable cancer's replicative immortality, and prevent cancer's evasion of growth suppressors. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as Decitabine may be used with chemotherapy and/or other classes of epigenetic enzyme inhibitor.<br /><br />With Decitabine therapy, hypermethylated promoters of genes involved in epigenetic enzyme regulation may become demethylated, and enzyme function rectified, causing further reversal of cancer's hypermethylation silencing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Using DNA methylation altering drugs, the late-replicating heterochromatin of partially methylated domains is inefficiently maintained upon replication. Promoter methylation decreases, reawakening silenced genes. Lost methylation marks aren't restored, and improvements to gene function are heritable.<br /><br />If epigenetic drugs remove insufficient methylation to slow some patients' tumor growth, changes in gene expression could alter cancer cell sensitivity to subsequent cytotoxic therapy.<br /><br />Cancer rearranges nuclear architecture, displacing active transcription factories. If demethylation can restore nuclear morphology and the function of key cellular regulatory pathways, chemotherapy could kill the most mutated, rapidly dividing cells - drug-resistant “persisters” - sparing cells the epigenetic drugs partially reverted to normal.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a time of rapid growth and active genomic reprogramming, when imprinting and lineage-dependant methylation marks are laid down. <br /><br />The most epigenetically sensitive periods are zygote pre-implantation through post-implantation, with the re-acquisition of lineage-specific epimarks; and gametogenesis in PGCs, with removal and laying down of imprinting epimarks, through mature gametes. <br /><br />Organs have brief developmental windows of sensitivity. Ova remain diploid until puberty. To avoid cancer in somatic cells and preserve offspring, Decitabine shouldn't be administered while gonads are maturing. Decitabine is safest for use after fertility.<br /><br /></p></div>
