    <div class="field-value"><p>There is a wast number of changes in epigenetic cellular state, associated with cancer. An important part of these changes is an alteration of DNA methylation (C5-methylation of cytosine residues) state. Considering the whole genome, cancer causes hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>Normally, methylation occuring in promoter gene regions induce silencing of that genes. But CpG islands in promoters are usually kept free of methylation, regardless of the gene activity state. <span>In many cancer types, CpG islands become hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing. Silencing of the tumor suppressors genes facilitates transformation of normal cell into a cancer cell.</span></p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands in promoters, intergenic regions and repetitive elements frequently possess high levels of methylation in normal cells. <span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is believed to be important for genomic integrity maintainance, which means inhibition of wrong recombination, transpositions, deletions and other genome transformations. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements experience hypomethylation through an active demethylation of C5-methylcytosines. This leads to genomic instability, which damages normal genes expression pattern and may lead to tumorogenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting allows expression of only one copy of a gene, while the other remains silenced. Disruption of imprinting may cause different abnormalities, including cancer.</p>
<p>For example, let's look upon H19/Igf2 cluster. Igf2 gene produce so called insuline-like growth factor 2 protein, H19 produce lnc-RNA. The cluster influences fetal growth.</p>
<p>It's a cluster of genes, which are normally imprinted. Imprinting control region (ICR) of Igf2 and H19 genes are methylated on the paternal allele, but not on the maternal allele. Methylation doesn't allow CTCF insulator protein to bind to a promoter region and thus allow paternal Igf2 expression, while the paternal H19 gene is silenced. Conversely,in maternal genome ICR is unmethylated, CTCF protein binds to it and blocks maternal Igf2 expression, while H19 does express.</p>
<p>If the imprinting of H19/Igf2 is disrupted, fetal growth abnormalities arise and childhood tumors, like, Wilm's tumor, may occur. For example, if the maternal copy of H19/Igf2 is methylated as the paternal one, the expression of Igf2 becomes upregulated, and H19 lncRNA, which is a tumor suppressor, is downregulated, which cause fetal and postnatal overgrowth and the possibility of Wilm's tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an approved and commercially produced anticancer drug, which acts on epigenetic level.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, closely resembling cytidine. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and DNMT inhibitor, which means that it acts by incorporation into DNA and subsequent DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition at the moment the enzyme reaches the site with the incorporated residue. DNMT binds irreversibly to it and becomes inactive. Therefore, DNA methylation state is not reproduced during replication, and the DNA of new cells obtained by cell division becomes less methylated, than the DNA of its predecessor. Though cancer cells' genomes are usually hypomehylated, some particular regions, like CpG islands in promoters, may become hypermethylated. DNMT inhibitors may prevent such hypermethylation, which can reactivate expression of tumor suppressor genes and slow down the malignant cell development. However, the detailed mechanism of DNMT inhibitors anticancer action is still unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is quite a persistive epigenetic modification, which, once established, tends to be stable during cell lifespan. This means that if some drug alters the methylation state of the genome during treatment, the resulting epigenetic features of the obtained cells a likely to conserve after treatment and affect tumor cells behaviour.</p>
<p>However, so called sensitive periods do exist, which are the periods when epigenetic state undergoes massive epigenetic remodelling. DNA demethylation and proper reestablishment of methylation are parts in such remodelling.</p>
<p>There are two important sensitive periods in mammals: early embryonic development (preimplantation and early postimplantation) and primordial germ cell development. If cell in sensitie period is treated with a drug, which influences epigenetic marks establishment, i.e. DNMT inhibitor, the epigenetic state of the resulting cells may become altered. This can lead to severe dysfunctions in expression in such cells. That's the reason why epigenetic anticancer drugs may have adverse effect on cells in sensitive periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</p></div>
