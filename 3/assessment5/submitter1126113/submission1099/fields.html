    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are part of the promoter region of the genes and are normally demethylated and thus allow transcrition to start and lead to expression of genes. In cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated. The promotor region thus folds an become heterochromatin, becoming unavailable for gene transcription start and thus leading to gene silencing. The hypermethylation of tumor supprosing genes in cancer causes the cell to proliferate by perventing cell appotoisis, and by being not able to suppress growth/ prolferation of the cell.</p>
<p>While CpG islands, which contains dense epigenetic markers,  are hypermethylated, the overall other intergenic and repititive elements which contain sparse methylation points are hypometylated in th ecase of cancer. Normally, the methylation of intergenic and repetitive elements helps preserve the structural integrity of chromtin by making it tight-knit. In cancer, due to hypomethylation, the chrmmatin becomes mor eeuchromatin in nature and this leads to genimic instability as there is now a signifcant chance of traslocations within chromosomes or possibility of additions and deletions. Thses genomic isntabilities and traslocations can disrupt the promoter region of tumor -=suppressin genes and agin lead to their silencing. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele at H19/igf2 cluster the ICR is methylated and thus the enhancers upstream do not activate expression of H19 gen, but this leads to igf2 gene being expressed due to paternal allele. the maternal allele on the other hand does not have ICR methylated and CTCF binds to ICR preventing enhancers to act on igf2 but rather acting on H19.</p>
<p>In cancerous tissue, this imprinting information is lost and both maternal and paternal ICR get methylated and thus igf2 gets expressed twice that is should be promting cell growth and leading to wilm's tumour. . </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demthylating drug which inhibits the methylation of DNA. It may act by limiting/ inhibiting the activity of DNMT etc. Wahtever be it sepigentic molecular mechanism, it works by reducing DNA methylation especially in CpG islands. This rectifies the fact that in cancerous tissues the CpG islands are hypermethylated- by making them again euchrmotin like, th etunor suppressing genes can now be expressed and this can lead to planned death or other mechainisims to keep the tumor in check.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigentic mechanism that is mititically inheritable....i.e. normal smotic mitosis or cell division preserves the DNA methylation pattrens. Thus if by some way we can modify the epgenetic markers like DNA methylation of a cell , then that would be acriied forward. However thi sis not meiotically heritable and everytime there is possibility of differntitation/ reimprinting of the DNA, then during that senistive devlopmenetal window, we should not play around with methylation or other epigentic mechanisms. specifically germ line cells and early embryonic develpomnet are senistiv eperiods where this sort of treatmnet should not be given. </p></div>
