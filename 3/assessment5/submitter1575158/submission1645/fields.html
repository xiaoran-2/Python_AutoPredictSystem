    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are CG-repeat rich regions in the human DNA, occuring in many separate places in the genome, mostly considered to be promoter regions (<a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1010">http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/25/10/1010</a>), and are typically hypomethylated compared to DNA methylation levels in other DNA regions. (#1:) DNA methylation in CpG islands is used for controlling gene expression, with hypermethylated CpG islands corresponding to silenced genes. (#2:) In cancer, we can observe a general hypermethylation of CpG islands, particularly in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes (#3:) which may correspond to the silencing of tumour suppressors and other regulatory genes. CpG dinucleotides are considerably more rare in other regions of the genome, and by and large, are always methylated. (#4:) This is so because CpG methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is part of DNA maintenance. CpG dinucleotides in intergenic/repetitive regions are methylated not long after the new strand is synthesized. Before the new strand is methylated, DNA repair enzymes check the validity of the new DNA and use this methylation information to distinguish the new strand from the template, cutting only the new strand in case an error is found. (#5:) This intergenic CpG methylation is also disrupted in cancer, in this case, the CpG dinucleotides lose methylation in cancerous cells. (#6:) This contibutes to the high DNA instability observed in almost all types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of genetic imprinting has also been described in cancer. The example used in the lectures was Wilm's tumour, a kidney tumor typically appearing in early childhood.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is one of earliest discovered imprinted genes. (#1:)The imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated, blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein. This results in the cromatin organizing itself into a more favourable loop structure connecting the Igf2 promoter to its enhancers, thus activating Igf2 transcription. (#2): On the maternal allele, CTCF is bound to the ICR, so the enhancers cannot bind to Igf2, thereby silencing its expression. Instead, the chromatin loops in a way that the enhancers activate the expression of the H19 lncRNA, which is a microRNA reservoir having no known role in Igf2 imprinting.</p>
<p>(#3:)In Wilm's tumour, the Igf2 ICR is methylated on<em> both</em> alleles. (#4:) The primary problem is not the missing H19, but the resulting overexpression of Igf2, now expressed from both alleles. Since Igf2 is a growth factor, its increased expression leads to increased cell proliferation which in turn evolves into Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(#1:) Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, and a DNMT inhibitor. (#2:) It binds to the DNA methyltransferases, preventing their work on the DNA. Thus, Decitabine causes a generic hypomethylation of DNA. Considering this effect, it is not surprising that Decitabine was toxic in the dosage used in the first trials. Later testing revealed that in low dosage Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. (#3:) The mechanism of the anti-tumour action of Decitabine is still unclear; it is speculated that the haematological malignancies where the drug is useful are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation of tumour suppressors. Cancer cells are also generally more vulnerable to this type of attack because of their rapid proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(#1:) DNA methylation patterns are retained and passed to daughter cells during mitosis, so altering the methylation state can have lasting effects even in somatic cells. For example, removing the hypermethylation from the promoters of certain tumour suppressors such as p53 can make the cell more sensitive to the additional damage imposed by chemotherapy, making chemoterapy itself more effective. It is favourable that most cancer patients come of the 40+ age group, since there could be harmful side effects during conception or early childhood, the sensitive periods in terms of epigenetics. (#2:) Sensitive periods are those when the epigenetic code is erased and rewritten, making the epigenetic code itself susceptible to environmental changes. (#3:) Most epigenetic code is written during the conceptional period; however epigenetic patterns for imprinted genes are established in the germline during puberty. (#4:) Since these epigenetic drugs have a generic demethylating action independent of cell type, it is likely that these drugs can have lasting and severe adverse effects on the offspring of the treated patient.</p></div>
