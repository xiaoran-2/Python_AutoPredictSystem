    <h1>Submission 1017 from Anon (session_user_id: 5cfcb4fb4d0a244c983f2df6b36655f46be91ed7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (trade name Dacogen) is a drug that is a DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabline is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits epigenetic regulators, blocks the activity of a gene <em class="Italic">Myc which e</em>ncodes a protein called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation system. This particular transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes. So, when it goes wrong it is one of the most common causes of cancer.</p>
<p title="DNA methyltransferase">Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p title="Azacitidine">It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.</p>
<p>A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth, deployed successfully against a solid tumour. The drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Methylation at CpG dinucleotides provides a mechanism for transmitting DNA methylation patterns after DNA replication and perpetuating patterns of epigenetic regulation through subsequent cell generations. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides results in symmetrically methylated CpG sites (i.e., methylation of the CpG sequence on both strands of DNA) <span>maintained through cell division. <span><span>CpGs clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters of genes</span>. </span></span><br /></span></p>
<p><span>DNA methylation is laid down by de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals.</span> <span>These de novo methyltransferases also appear to play a role in maintenance methylation to fully preserve parental DNA methylation patterns in daughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span>Methylation of CpG islands, especially those islands colocalized with promoters, is generally associated with gene repression. </span></p>
<div dir="ltr">DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.</div>
<p><span>DNA methylation changes in tumors were associated with concomitant changes in gene expression and tumor characteristic. The DNA methylation changes in cancer do not appear to be random because tumors of specific cell lineages show similar DNA methylation changes that are distinct. As tumors increase in severity, a large number of loci show increased DNA methylation primarily at CpG islands and decreased DNA methylation in non-CpG islands sites. </span></p>
<div dir="ltr">Aberrations in epigenetic control seen in cancer: DNA methylation, both the Locus specific DNA
<div dir="ltr">hypermethylation (CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour) and the Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (analysis shows repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and ICRs – loss of imprinting). </div>
</div>
<p><span>Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. <br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. That is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>EZH2 enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging. A lot of lymphomas are caused by mutations that make EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. <span class="st">DNA methylation contributes to carcinogenesis by silencing key tumor suppressor genes. </span></p>
<p>Substance JQ1, which inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocks the activity of a gene by the name of <em class="Italic">Myc</em>. <em class="Italic">Myc</em> encodes a protein called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation system. Not surprisingly, then, when it goes wrong it is one of the most common causes of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal individuals, <em>IGF2</em> expression is from the paternal allele and <em>H19</em> is from the maternal allele. IC1 and DMR0 are methylated on the paternal chromosome.</p>
<p>In the Wilms tumour, <em>IGF2</em> activation and <em>H19</em> silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal imprints (somatic loss of imprinting).</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, however, methylation profiles of IC1 and <em>IGF2</em> DMR0 are indicative of methylation changes occurring on both parental alleles rather than in <em>cis</em>.</p>
<p>Wilms tumour patients, methylation at the DMR0 is lost on the paternal allele, while IC1 gains methylation on the maternal allele. DMR0 methylation levels are particularly low in some of the tumours, indicating an almost complete eradication of methylation at this site probably from both alleles. Epigenetic reprogramming thus occurs on both parental chromosomes rather than in <em>cis</em>, indicating that different mechanisms control <em>IGF2</em> imprinting in neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells.</p>
<p>Soma-wide IC1 hypermethylation in BWS predisposes to Wilms tumour and similar epigenetic changes occurs in the kidney as pre-neoplastic events in Wilms tumorigenesis. It is possible that DMR0 hypomethylation is associated with a more sustained activation of <em>IGF2</em> in tumour cells as a result of alternative high level chromatin conformation promoted by tumour-specific activators.</p>
