    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The global level of DNA methylation is higher in normal cells compared with tumoral cells. On the other hand, in normal cells, CpG islands within promoter regions of genes are usually kept free of methylation, which allows gene transcription. In general terms, CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells, particularly in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. This supposes that these genes will not be transcribed, and this type of genes are involved in important functions of cell growth as cell cycle control, apoptosis or DNA repair, what is favouring abnormal cellular growth. Hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumours because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected. Examples of CpG island hypermethylation are: RB in retinoblastoma , MLH1 in colorectal cancer,  BRCA1 in breast cancer, and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumours.</span></p>
<p><span>Also important is hypermethylation at CpG island shores in cancer cells, which are regions in the neighbouring of CpG islands (2 kb). It seems that this methylation correlates better with gene expression than CpG islands methylation. </span></p>
<p><span>In normal cells, some genome regions are hypermethylated, which confers genomic integrity. These are intergenic regions, repetitive elements, intronic regions and CpG poor promoters. In cancer cells, theses regions are hypomethylated. The consequences of hypomethylation will depend on location. So, in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, hypomethylation leads to genomic inestability, whereas hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters leads to oncogene activation. Genomic instability due to hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic intervals is conditioned by illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (e.g. Avy and Axinfu alleles). Evidences that hypomethylation leads to genomic instability is coming from mouse models (Dnmt1 KO), from human disease (genomic instability is characteristic in ICF syndrome due to mutations in DNMT3B gene), and from many human cancers.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Alterations in DNA methylation at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of tumour suppressor genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Hypermethylation of ICRs results in loss of imprinting. This is an early event, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</span></p>
<p><span>H19/Igf2 cluster suffers paternal imprinting. This means that, in normal cells, ICR in paternal allele is methylated which impedes CTCF coupling to this region and spreads methylation to H19 gene promoter, suppressing its expression. As a consequence of this, downstream enhancers activate Igf2 gene expression, which encodes a growth promoter protein. In the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated allowing the CTCF binding. CTCF is an insulator protein; this means that enhancers (which have as a first preference Igf2 gene) will activate H19 gene and Igf2 will not be expressed (CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). In resume, in normal cells, only paternal Igf2 gene will be expressed and maternal Igf2 gene will be silenced. </span></p>
<p><span>If the ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in the maternal allele, Igf2 gene will be activated (because CTCF will not able to bind it) resulting in a double doses of this oncogene (from paternal and maternal alleles). This situation is related with the apparition of Wilm’s tumour (a childhood kidney tumour).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog acting as a DNMT inhibitor, FDA approved. Basically, this drug reduce the methylation state: Decitabine is incorporated into DNA upon replication and when DNMT binds for methylating this nucleoside analog the binding is irreversible, so the enzyme can’t be released impeding its action on the daughter DNA strand. The action of Decitabine is division-dependent, so as tumour cells divide more rapidly than normal cells the first will be more affected, in other words, the methylation state will be reduced in cancer cells. Although the mechanism of action of this drug still unclear, the anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is related with those cancers in which hypermethylation is important as in haematological malignancies. It is possible that Decitabine is effective in myelodysplastic syndromes because they are dependent of CpG island hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> It has been speculated that induced-epigenetic changes by these drugs are transferred during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased, and, once deleted they do not return. This can suppose that epigenetic therapies would affect only cancer cells. This can be acceptable for elderly people with a low life expectancy, in whom  survival is the primary aim. However, important concerns arise from the fact that drug-induced epigenetic changes could affect to all kind of cells of the organism, which can result in serious side effects. And this is especially important during sensitive periods of development. These periods correspond with early embryonic development and primordial germ-cell development during which epigenetic reprogramming take place. From fertilised egg to blastocyst, both maternal and paternal genome suffer a DNA demethylation process  which is recovered at epiblast stage. During this period, imprinted genes are maintained. Since mid-gestation embryo, primordial germ cells suffer demethylation and lost of imprinting which is recovered during the process of gamete maturation. The use of epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods (in pregnant women or in young people) is not advisable because they can produce unexpected and serious side effects as they can alter the development  or produce genome abnormalities in gametes.</span></p></div>
