    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Normal function of DNA methylation</strong> <strong>at CpG islands</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>It influences various epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin typically suppressing the gene expression.</li>
<li>CpG islands are present in about 60% of promoters of gene expression and are free of methylation.</li>
</ul><p><strong>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>On the other hand CpG islands in cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated.</li>
</ul><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The hyper methylation of promoter CpG islands  causes silencing of the underlying gene which may be a tummor suppressor.</li>
<li>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.</li>
<li>Example hypermethylation if BRCA1 in breast cancer</li>
</ul><p><strong>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</strong></p>
<p>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DN. These result in  highly expressed genes, inhibit antisense transcription,repress transcriptional noise from alternate start sites and chromatin compartmentalization.</p>
<p><strong> DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer:</strong></p>
<p>Directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats are found in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong> DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Long-range silencing of repetitive sequences is lost</li>
<li>over expression of growth promoting genes</li>
<li>inhibit antisense transcription,</li>
<li>repress transcriptional noise from alternate start sites and chromatin compartmentalization.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Methylation pattern of the paternal and maternal allele and how this determines         Igf2 expression status:</strong></p>
<ul><li>paternally expressed lncRNA AIR, is required for silencing the maternally expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r.</li>
<li>inhibits expression by targeting the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a to the Slc22a3 promoter.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Hypermethylation of ICR,Igf2 overexpression in Wilm's tumour.</li>
</ul><p><strong>  Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease:</strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to:          </strong></p>
<ul><li>  Decitabine belongs to class of  DNMTi(DNA methyltransferasinhibitor) there by causing hypo methylation.</li>
</ul><p><strong> impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation: </strong>(induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms)</p>
<ul><li>inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and</li>
<li>direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death</li>
</ul><p><strong> Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by the following  process:<br /></strong></p>
<ul><li>Demythylation may weaken the effects of gene silencing mechanisms that occurred prior to the methylation.</li>
<li>Demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and thus confer relative gene activation.</li>
<li>In turn may activate tumour suppressor genes.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the   epigenome:</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Stephen Baylin , have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and DMTi (Decitabine) slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer and participants without much response to these  showed  good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs subsequently. This shows that epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way,also more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.The lasting effects are quite possible. since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased using the inhibitors(epigentic drugs), they do not return. Effectively epigenetic therapies can stop cancer growth without having to kill all its cells as in the case of chemotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning sensitive period and the period in development: </strong></p>
<p>It is the period in which epigenetic reprogramming happens<strong>.</strong>The  periods are</p>
<ul><li>primordial germ cell development (production of mature eggs and sperms )and</li>
<li>fetal germline (preimplanted and early post implantation period) development</li>
</ul><p><strong>treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable:</strong></p>
<p>Since epigenetic reprogramming happens during this period, <strong></strong>large insult to the environment would be taking a drug  that inhibits the epigenetic machinery which  may have adverse implication on the well being of the patient in the long term.</p></div>
