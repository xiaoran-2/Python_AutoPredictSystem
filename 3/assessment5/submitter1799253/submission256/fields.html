    <div class="field-value"><p>When DNA is methylated at CpG islands, it silences the gene which is controlled by the promoter which contains these methylated CpG islands.  However, normally throughout the genome, <strong>CpG islands are seldom methylated</strong>.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands is<strong> mutagenic</strong>, because the methylated Cytosine,5-methyl cytosine is deaminated and changes into thymine.  In time, there will be more T in place of C throughout the genome, and CpG islands will be <strong>underrepresented in the genome</strong>.  </p>
<p>CpG islands are usually found in the promoter region upstream from the gene it controls.  When <strong>CpG islands are methylated</strong>, they prevent transcription factors to bind the promoter and the <strong>gene expression will be silenced</strong>.  Usually, CpG islands in the promoter regions of the genome are hypomethylated, but <strong>in cancer these regions are found</strong> <strong>to be hypermethylated</strong>.  This phenomenon can result in disease because DNA methylation at the CpG islands silences the promoter and prevents the downstream expression of a gene.   In the case of a tumor suppressor gene, for example, because the gene is silenced, no tumor suppressor protein is made, allowing tumors to grow unchecked.  </p>
<p>Under normal conditions, most <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated</strong>, so as to silence the <strong>crypti</strong><strong>c transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites</strong> in these regions, maintaining overall genomic integrity and stability.  However, i<strong>n cancer these regions are hypomethylated. </strong> This global hypomethylated state contributes to genomic instability.  For example, unwanted transcription would start up when normally it should be silence, or splice sites show up when they should not be exposed, resulting in altered functions and disease states.  Studies also showed that cells lacking methyltransferase enzymes have karyotype abnormalities such as deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions.  These abnormalities represent genomic instability which can lead to serious disease states including cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR (imprint control region) of the paternal allele is methylated and methylation also spreads in <em>cis</em> fashion downstream to the H19 locus.  When this region is methylated, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR on the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, and this allows the downstream <strong>enhancer to turn on Igf2 expression</strong>.  On the other hand, the ICR of the <strong>maternal allele</strong> is not methylated, allowing the CTCF protein to bind to this region and 'obstruct' the enhancer to loop around and turn on the upstream Igf2, <strong>'insulating' the <em>cis</em> Igf2 gene from being turnd on</strong>.  The enhancer therefore goes to the more proximate <em>cis</em> gene, H19, and causes its transcrption instead.  Wilm's tumor is a childhood cancer of the kidney.  It is one of the manifestations of the Beckwith-Wiedeman Syndrome. In this disease, the <strong>maternal allele behaves like a paternal allele</strong> (caused by abnormal imprinting due to mutation, deletion, parental disomy), therefore resulting in <strong>double-dose expression of Igf2,</strong> which is a growth promoting protein, leading to abnormal growth, or cancer. The expression of H19 is also disrupted, resulting in decreased transcription of its ncRNA products. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of 'small molecule inhibitors' which targets and inhibits enzymes that are epigenetic regulators.  Decitabine specifically targets and inhibits 'DNA methyl transferase' (whose function is to methylate targets such as cytosine in CpG islands).  It is therefore a <strong>DNMTi</strong> .  It is a nucleoside analog which <strong>binds irreversibly</strong> to DNMT.  As such, it needs to be incorporated into the DNA first, so it is <strong>replication dependent</strong>.  In its therapeutic use in treating Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressing to AML, Decitabine is thought to inhibit methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes.  Its antitumor effect is as follows: when these CpG regions are hypermethylated, the tumor suppressor gene is silenced, and tumorigenesis happens.  But if Decitabine can reverse hypermethylation by inhibiting the enzyme DNMT, then the CpG becomes demethylated, and the tumor suppressor gene is turned back on. Also, since cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, the drug selectively acts on cancer cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks are <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>, i.e. they are preserved in daughter cells and granddaughter cells,  until erased.  When erased, they remain erased.</p>
<p>During development, there are two sensitive periods.  One is <strong>between fertilization and pre-implantation, up to blastocyste stage; </strong>and the other is during<strong> the primordial cell development, in mid-embryonic stage, when the gametes are being formed.</strong>  Sensitive periods are when<strong> most epigenomic marks are cleared, in preparation for laying down new marks. </strong>  However, certain marks are preserved, such as imprinted states such as the mouse paternal x-inactivation, or methylation of repetitive sequences, such as IAPs.  </p>
<p>In Dr Baylin's article, the two drugs used to treat the solid lung tumor, a DNMTi and a HDACi were both <strong>inhibitors</strong> of epigenetic regulating enzymes.   They found that the drugs' effects  extended beyond the period of treatment.  The speculation is that the<strong> epigenetic marks were erased for good</strong> by these drugs, because they are no longer inherited by daughter cells once they are erased.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods when more cells are dividing, these drugs, which erase marks nonselectively, may disrupt regions such as imprinted genes, or repetitive regions, causing unintended consequences. Also, the histone deacetylase inhibitors may act on other proteins such as other transcription factors, causing disruption of cellular function.</p></div>
