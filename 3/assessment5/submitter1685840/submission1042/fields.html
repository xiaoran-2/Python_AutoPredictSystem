    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In a normal cell, the expression of a gene is controlled by DNA methylation. That is the main epigenetic mark. Usually, DNA methylation is not much found on CpG island, but when it happens, and that a gene promoter is involved, then the whole gene is silenced. That's how our cells can differenciate from one another (skin cells, heart cells, liver cells, etc.)</li>
<li> In cancer cells, we can find a lot of DNA methylation at the CpG islands. That is the first alteration of DNA methylation in cancer. It often happens on the promoters of tumour supressor genes, wich are involved in the repression of the uncontrolled growth of cells, what causes cancers. As this epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable, this alteration rapidly spreads in a lot of cell. </li>
<li>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements has another role : It helps to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, DNA methylation in intergenic regions silence the elliptic transcription start sites or splice sites. Furthermore, DNA methylation in repetitive elements helps preventing from transposition and illegitimate recombination. </li>
<li>However, in cancer cells, these regions are less methylated, and then it occurs transposition and recombination that alter genomic stability. This disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements then contributes to the spread of the tumour.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of enhancers, wich try to access H19 and Igf2. Between these two latest is post the ICR, wich can bind to the insulator protein CTCF. This protein isolate Igf2 from the enhancers.</li>
<li>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated, so there's no binding of CTCF on it, and the enhancers can access Igf2. The methylation spread onto the promoter of H19 wich is then silenced.</li>
<li>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methlated, so it binds to CTCF, wich isolate Igf2, and forced the enhancers to access H19.</li>
<li>The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome leads to the maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, so there is an upregulation of Igf2, wich is an oncogene. The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome<strong> </strong>leading to a predisposition to the embryonic/childhood tumour such as Wilm's tumour, then disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors, and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration authority.</li>
<li>As DNMT (De Novo MethylTransferase) is a protein involved in DNA methylation, so a DNMT inhibitor will reduce the DNA methylation. </li>
<li>Since there are less DNA methylation, there are less silencing of tumour supressor genes, so the uncontrolled growth of cell is then fixed, and this drug has an anti-tumour effect.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span><span><span lang="zxx" xml:lang="zxx">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome if it happens during a so-called sensitive period, that is a period of epigenetic reprogramming.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span lang="zxx" xml:lang="zxx">These sensitive periods take place during the early development and the Primordial Germ Cell development (PGC development). During these periods, the epigenetic marks are removed, so the epigenome is a lot sensitive to the </span></span></span><span><span><span lang="zxx" xml:lang="zxx">environmental effects. Then, if we treat a patient with such drug during it's sensitive periods, it would change all his epigenetic marks, and then alter his epigenome. This could then lead to severe disease or another tumour can be triggered.</span></span></span></li>
