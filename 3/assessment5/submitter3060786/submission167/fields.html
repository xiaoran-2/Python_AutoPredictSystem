    <h1>Submission 167 from Anon (session_user_id: 4ea49bae893ee3cba950247a52e1d518ece75ece)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used as a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that this particular substance decreases the level of methylation in DNA. It is not clear in  general that reducing the level of DNA methylation may be useful since some tumors have hypermethylation in CpG islands whereas others have hypometylation in DNA repeats, or a mixture of boths. Every tumour must be studied in order to see if depletion of methylation would in fact decrease the tumour or enhance tumour growing and therefore be dangerous. The role of Dna methylation is context dependent and can even be stage specific during tumour growth. Decitabine is being used to treat <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">myelodysplastic syndromes</span> precursors of <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">acute myelogenous leukaemia</span>. Decitabine may reduce the level of methylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour supressor genes and therefore allow the expression of the tumour supressors genes decreasing tumorgenecity</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general there is hypermethylation in specific locus in cancer.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter is to inhibit gene expression. In normall cells gene promoters CpG islands of tumour supressor genes are hypomethylated allowing expression of tumour supressors</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Normally promoters CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer and it has the same effect as mutation. In fact CpG islands hypermethylation in promoterst is used as a biomarker for cancer</span>.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands in promoter genes of tumour supressor genes leads to silencing of these genes. Hypermethylation increases with tumorigenecity.</p>
<p> Normall cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, but  intergenic regions are in part methylated,  in introns and particularly in repetitive elements. This is reversed in cancer cells, so that intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated allowing their recombination and sometimes transposition.Chromatin is less packed when hypomethylated and this can lead to translocation of parts of a chromosome.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in intergenic islands and repetitive elements contributes to genomic instability leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpostion, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. This abnormal karyotype seen in some cancers and due to genomic instability coud be the result of deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>Some cancers appear when CpG poor promoters - CpG that can not be considered CpG islands- are hypomethylated. This happens in R-Ras gastric cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally cancer cells show loss of imprinting, probably because most of the genes that undergo imprinting are involved in growth or growth supressing, and tumourgenecity involves abnormal growing.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In a normal cell we can see the paternal allele H19 is methylated and silenced and there is no insulator so enhancers act on Igf2 and it is expressed</span>. <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In a normal cell we can see </span>in the maternal allele that the ICR- imprinting control region-  is unmethylated so the insulator CTCF binds to it, enhancers cannot act and therefore H19 is expressed. Igf2 will be silenced and we do not see expression on it.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour both maternal and paternal ICR are methylated and both Igf2 alleles are expressed whereas both H19 are silenced. This lead to an abnormal expression of the genes and causes cancer.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">a double dose of Igf2 leading to childhood kidney tumour</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means that remodelling of DNA methylation is passed from one cell to the offspring of that cell every time there is a division by mitosis. So any disruption or alteration of DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because is could be inherited by nitosis.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a stage in development when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled, they are removed and laid down. Altered environments during sensitive periods such as chemotherapy have an effect on epigenetic control and could then be transgenerational inherited if they affect reproductive cells. Particularly sensitive periods are those for primordial cell development all the way to production of gametes. Treating patients during sensitive periods involving reproductive cells should be avoided since epigenetic patterns could be passed from parents to offspring altering normal re-programming of epigenetic marks.</p>
