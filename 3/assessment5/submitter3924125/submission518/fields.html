    <h1>Submission 518 from Anon (session_user_id: d784cede56b3d1136be01e5e10daa092880281e7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs <strong>to the</strong><strong> DNA</strong><strong> methyltransferase inhibitors DNMTi class</strong></li>
<li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. <strong>It’s a nucleoside analog like 5-Azacytidine.  It gets incorporated into the DNA when the DNA is undergoing replication, when the DNA  methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that  nucleotide to the copy, then that DNA  methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and therefore it can no longer be released. </strong></li>
<li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. <strong>Cancer cells divide much more rapidly than most other "normal" cells in the body this DNMTi class drug comes along to bind that nucleotide to the copy, then that DNA  methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and therefore it can no longer be released thus reducing the cell division of cancer.  A more direct anti-tumour effect is that Decitabine has a potent anti-neoplastic effect, which helps destroy the tumorcells. </strong></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation is a process that provides the addition of a methyl group to a DNA nucleotide (cytosine<strong><strong>/</strong></strong>adenine). Through mitotic cell division, </strong><strong>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic marker which is passed onto subsequent cellular divisions. </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>As stated in the “Cancer’s Epicentre” article “epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer”.  DNA methylation contributes to silencing genes that promote tumours and with the adjunct of chemotherapy can have a double impact on treating cancer.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>During sensitive<strong>/</strong>critical periods of development (i.e. the first thousand days after conception for a human being) can greatly influence DNA methylation patterns and gene expression which can alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Such periods are primordial germ cell development (up to production of mature eggs and sperm). The second sensitive period is the pre-implanted and early post-implantation </strong><strong>period.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Treating younger patients within these time-sensitive periods i.e. germ cell development, the drug would inhibit the normal and necessary machinery that would need to occur for normal development.</strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Helps the <span>dinucleotides to be maintained during cell division. </span>It works by helping maintain the methyl group on the parent side within the CPG dinucleotide which helps provide a stable epigenetic mark and therefore more genomic stability.  Don't typically see methylation at CPG islands, normally they are hypo-methylated.</strong></p>
<p> Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.       <strong> CPG islands are more likely to be methylated/hyper-methylated in a cancer cell.  CPG islands are typically found in promotors of tumour suppressor genes and epigenetically inactivates/silences these cancer fighting tumour suppressor genes</strong> <strong>which then become mitotically heritable which can then create a proliferation of epimutations and cancer.</strong></p>
<p>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease. <strong>CPG island methylation progresses as we age.  As a result of more active methylation of CPG islands, DNA methylation at CPG islands is switched between normal cells and abnormal cells which then silence tumour suppressor genes which can give rise to biological insults and greater susceptibility to disease.</strong></p>
<p> Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. <strong> Most of the gene is made up of intergenic regions and repeats.   In general the genome is methylated in repetitive elements <span><span>through the intergenic regions.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted.  <strong>These intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically hypo-methylated in cancer creating higher genomic instability and thus a higher degree of deletions and insertions to occur.</strong></p>
<p>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.  <strong>As previously stated, any mechanism that creates for a condition of greater genomic instability can therefore often give rise to biological insults and greater susceptibility to disease.</strong></p></div>
