    <h1>Submission 1374 from Anon (session_user_id: 3316a144e28ed10c6290d50e38b4ac20702db7d9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents, along with azacitidine which targets the enzyme DNMTi. Demethylating agents are succesful in removing methylating marks from cells, these changes are stably inherited to subsequent generations. Once the altered epigenetic profile of cancer cells are removed the cells behave in a normal manner during cell divisions, and thus furthur growth of the cancer can be prevented, without having to destroy all the cancerous cells. Recent studies have shown that these profile altered cells, were also more susceptible to standard chemotherapy than unaltered cancer cells. Hence drugs like decitabine can combat cancer cells in a wofold manner, one by altering  their epigenetic profile to prevent unwanted proliferation and two  by making them more sensitive to conventional cancer treatment methods like chemotherapy.</p></div>

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The chemical modification of C5 position of cytosine is called methylation, which accounts for such epigenetic phenomena like imprinting,X chromosome inactivation and heterochromatin formation. Methylation of promotor sites usually leads to inactivation of normal genes, however CpG islands in promotor sequences are usually free from this modification. In cancer cells on the other hand these promotors are hypermethylated, leading to gene inactivation. Genome wide hypomethylation and localised hypermethylation are two features exhibited by cancerous cells. This causes reduction in genomic stability, deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes along with supression of tumor supressor genes which control cellcycles, apoptosis or DNA repair mechanisms, leading to a higher cancer incidence. Gene flanking regions are also adversely affected in cancerous tissues. 2kb regions flanking CpG islands called island shores also show aberrent methylation in cancer cells. Colorectal cancer tissues show hypermethylation of these  flanking regions, as do nerve sheath tumors. In normal cells intragenic methylation is seen in repetitive sequences, LINEs and SINEs in human DNA, which probably aid in the inactivation of these sequences. High rates of gene expression in humans have also been identified with gene body methylation. This is due to the repression of trancription from alternative start sites , inhibition of antisense transcription and RNA splicing. CIMPs are CpG rich sites which tend to show unusually high rates of DNA methylation in colorectal tissues. Tumor cells  tend to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation as they progress, this has been used as a marker for classifying different tumor types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Methylation or demethylation affects imprint control regions of he genome. They can lead to either loss of expression or over-expression of growth promoting genes.  In normal cells the paternal allele for H19/Igf2 is methylated while the maternal one is hypomethylated. CTCF thus can protect the icr in the maternal chromosome and no expression of IgF2 results from it. At the same time methylation of icr on the paternal allele results in optimum IgF2 expression. When hypermethylation occurs, the maternal icr is methylated along with the paternal one. CTCF therefore cannot protect the icr on the maternal chromosome causing the enhancer elements  to initiaite production of IgF2, this augments the expression of the same gene from the paternal chromosome also. This doubles the amount of IgF2 from cells which leads to Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylating patterns once stably established, can be maintained indefinitely in that cell line. Hence drugs which alter the methylation patterns will have these patterns perpetuated through furthur generations thereby altering the epigenome. Moreover these alterations will be erased from the epigenome only at the time of resetting, which happens in two phases in humans. These phases are called the sensitive periods as the methylation marks of the adults are erased and reset anew, at the time of primordial germ cell development and the other during gamete formation. Cancer treatment in young people using epigenome altering drugs needs to be done with caution especially if they are in the process of conceiving the next generation.</p></div>
