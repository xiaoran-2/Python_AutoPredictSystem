    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, which is a process of methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides, can occur in several regions including CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive regions. First, CpG islands are clusters of CpGs and are often at gene promoters. Therefore, methylation in CpG islands can silence genes. Methylation in CpG islands also function in X inactivation because methylated CpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. </p>
<p>In a normal cell CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, so CpG islands are usually unmethylated. In contrast, in cancer cell DNA methylation is hypermethylated. This DNA hypermethylation can silence tumour suppressor genes and cause loss of imprinting. For example, hypermethylation at imprinting control regions can cause loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Hypermethylation can also occur at CpG island shores and this hypermethylation correlates with gene expression.</p>
<p>Besides CpG islands, DNA methylation can occur at intergenic regions and repetitive regions. In a normal cell intergenic regions and repetitive regions are usually methylated. A main function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive regions is to maintain genomic integrity. Because DNA methylation is mutagenic, DNA methylation at repetitive elements also protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>In contrast to a normal cell in which intergenic regions and repetitive regions are usually methylated, a cancer cell tends to have hypomethylation. Hypomethylation in these regions can cause genomic instability such as insertion and deletion.</p>
<p>To sum up, role of DNA methylation is context dependent. If hypermethylation occur in CpG islands, it tends to silence tumour suppressor genes. However, if hypomethylation occur at intergenic regions and repetitive regions, it tends to cause chromosomal instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in imprint control regions (ICRs) can bring about imprinted gene expression. However, ICR DNA methylation does not always correlate with silencing of gene expression. Mechanism of ICR varies with each cluster. For example, in H19/Igf2 cluster in human chromosome 11, ICR acts as an enhancer blocking.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Without CTCF binding, Igf2 downstream enhancer can activate expression of igf2. Furthermore, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence H19. In contrast to the paternal allele, the maternal allele DNA methylation does not occur at ICR, so binding of CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Also, with CTCF, H19 is not silenced in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>However, in a cancer cell there is hypermethylation of ICRs at the H19/Igf2 cluster. This hypermethylation causes overexpression of Igf2 in Wilm’s tumour, cancer of the kidneys. With hypermethylation of ICRs, CTCF is no longer be able to bind ICR in maternal allele. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence. Therefore, igf2 is overexpressed while H19 is underexpressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression and play an important role in cancer. Methylation of DNA in the proximity of a gene promoter causes stable gene silencing. Hypermethylation has been associated with tumor progression and has been detected in myelodysplastic syndrome, a class of conditions where certain blood cells are dysfunctional, and acute myelogenous leukaemia. This might be because hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent, or a hypomethylating agent, which can incorporate into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). It indirectly removes methylcytosine and causes hypomethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters. In myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukaemia, DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is required to maintain DNA methylation and aberrant gene silencing. Decitabine act as a DNMT inhibitor. Therefore, with Decitabine, DNMT1 cannot maintain gene silencing. As a result, the silenced tumor suppressor genes can be reactivated and expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr.Baylin’s study showed that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and a DNA-hypomethylating agent can slow tumour growth. This study also showed that some of the participants showed an unexpectedly good reaction to the chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Chemotherapeutic drugs work by impairing cell division and effectively targeting fast-dividing cells. Also, the drugs affect more differentiated cell more effectively because mechanisms that regulate cell growth are still preserved. Therefore, tumors become less responsive to most chemotherapeutic agents in succeeding generations of tumor cells because differentiation is typically lost.</p>
<p>Next, the reason that altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome might be that epigenetic changes can be passed on during cell division to daughter. In addition, Dr.Baylin’s drug might help preserve or recover mechanisms regulating cell growth, so chemotherapeutic drugs work more effectively.</p>
<p>However, there are periods in development that environments which have an effect on epigenetic control, known as sensitive periods. Two main sensitive periods in mammals are germ cell development and early embryonic development. Epigenetic reprogramming mostly occurs in these periods; therefore it would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs because the drugs might interfere the process of epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
