    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands often co-located with promoters of genes. In normal cell CpG islands tend to be not methylated. Methylation CpG islands cause silencing of gene expression.  In cancer cells CpG islands tends to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. In cancer cell they become less methylated. It leads to less density DNA package and genomic instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated (imprinted). DNA methylation prevents insulator protein (CTCF) binding to ICR and therefore distal enhancer can promote igf2 expression. Also methylation spread from ICR to H19 region and make it silenced.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele ICR is not methylated and therefore CTCF binds to it and prevents igf2 expression. H19 region is not methylated also and expressed under distal enhancer.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor both maternal and paternal alleles have methylated ICR in igf2/H19 cluster. As a result igf2 is expressed on both alleles (over expressed).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It recognized by DNA replication machinery and incorporates to DNA upon replication as a substitute for cytosine. Unlike cytosine it binds DNMT1 irreversibly and that causes toxic (nonspecific) effect on divided cells. Cancer cells divides faster than the normal cells and therefore more subject to toxic effect Decitabine.</p>
<p>When DNMT1 irreversibly binds to DNA it also compromises DNA functionality and triggers DNA damage signaling. DNA Repairing mechanisms causes degradation of trapped DNMT1 and lost methylation marks. DNA demethylating may result in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. This could be another (non toxic) anti-tumor effect of Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drug treatment of divided cells with epigenetic drugs will result in change methylation of certain sites. If methylation changed on both strands of DNA than those changes will be maintained for further cell divisions in the absence of epigenetic drug.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks have a sensitive period to drug treatment during early prenatal development when extensive epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs at two different stages: 1) from the zygote through the blastocyst stage of pre-implantation development; 2) during gametogenesis. Drug treatment during those periods could disrupt the DNA methylation pattern, disturb cellular differentiation and organogenesis and could have life-long impact.</p></div>
