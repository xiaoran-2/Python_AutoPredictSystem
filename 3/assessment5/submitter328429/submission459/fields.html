    <h1>Submission 459 from Anon (session_user_id: 72a6b7886a1cf202e1e201d5c28fc85b5f875d43)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>*Epigenetic marks, like DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable thanks to DNMT1 methyltransferase which lays down methyl marks on semi-methylated strands of DNA during cell division. This secures that daughter strand will have the same methylation marks as original strand.</p>
<p><br />*Sensitive periods are those when cells in organism undergo epigenetic reprogramming.  Cells in these periods are especially sensitive to environmental influences which can easily interfere with removal or re-establishment of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p><br />*The first sensitive period is pre-implantational period of embryo before it makes placenta. In this period all epigenetic marks of stem cells are removed in order to be re-established according to each finally-differentiated cells. The second period is when pre-mordial germ cells are being created, which is in the middle of gestation. Also all epigenetic marks of somatic cells must be removed and new germ cell specific marks must be established so they could fulfill their germ functions.</p>
<p><br />*Because cells undergoing epigenetic reprogramming are highly susceptible to environmental influences which could easily alter normal process of removing and laying down epigenetic marks. Mutagenic agents could cause inappropriate pattern of epigenetic marks and therefore influence gene expression which could even be lethal to embryo.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>*High concentration of CpG islands is found in promoters of genes, thus DNA methylation influences gene expression, specifically gene silencing.  In healthy cells we don´t see much DNA methylation at CpG islands of promoters of genes because most of genes must be active for cell to proliferate. However methylation is found mainly in repetitive elements and intergenic regions which must be silenced in order to maintain genome integrity and stability.</p>
<p>*In cancer we see genome-wide hypomethylation and locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands. Methylation of CpG islands in cancer means that promoters of genes (which should be active) are now silenced in cancer cells.</p>
<p>*DNA methylation of CpG islands can lead to cancer if it occurs in promoters of genes that are responsible for suppressing tumors, preventing uncontrolled cell growth and division or in genes that are responsible for programmed cell death if the cell is damaged.</p>
<p>*Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is crucial to maintain stability because repetitive elements are genome parasites  which copy and paste themselves randomly in genome. Silencing repetitive elements and intergenic regions prevents disruption of genes, maintains genomic integrity and prevents mistakes (deletions, duplications, translocations or illegitimate crossover of chromosomes).</p>
<p>*One of cancer hallmarks is genome-wide hypomethylation (lack of methylation). Majority of genome which should be silenced by DNA methylation is now demethylated and therefore active. It means that many repetitive elements and intergenic elements are now active (instead silenced).<strong></strong></p>
<p>*Unmethylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions are actively transcribed in cancer. Repetitive elements copy and paste themselves randomly inside genome disrupting genes. If it disrupts tumor suppressor genesm, cells can grow and divide uncontrollably leading to cancer. Lack of methylation at intergenic regions can make intergenic regions to bind transcription factors and cause transcription interference with expression of main gene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>*In paternal allele imprint control region is methylated, so CTCF protein can´t bind to it. It means that CTCF can´t block enhancers and they are free to activate transcription of Igf2 gene, which is an oncogene (promoting growth).</p>
<p>*In maternal allele imprint control region is unmethylated, so CTCF protein can bind to it. It means that CTCF can block enhancers and they can´t activate transcription of Igf2 gene. Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>*In Wilm´s tumor, Igf2 in maternal allele is disrupted.  Its imprint control region is methylated like on paternal allele. So cell has 2 paternal-like alleles. It leads to overexpression of Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>*Since Igf2 is oncogene (promoting growth) its over-expression leads to uncontrolled growth and division of cell and consequently to tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>*Decitabine is an DNA-demethylation agent. It is a class of epigenetic inhibitors which act on DNA methyltransferase (inhibiting it). It blocks laying down DNA methylation marks.</p>
<p>*Decitabine decreases methylation of DNA, thus prevents silencing of many genes and activates many genes (for example tumour supressor genes).</p>
<p>*By blocking DNA methylation, Decitabine can activate many genes, such as tumor suppressor genes which can prevent uncontrolable  growth of tumour cells.</p></div>
