    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, DNA methylation of gene promoter regions inversely correlates with the expression of the particular gene, <em>i.e.</em> as methylation increases the gene expression decreases. An exception is the methylation of CpG islands (CGI), found in several promoters, which are typically free of methylation regardless of their expression state. CpG island methylation is disrupted in cancer cells and the CGI becomes hypermethylated. Hypermethylation of the CGI causes the underlying gene to become silenced, which can cause disease due to the disrupted gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is also found in intragenic regions and repetitive elements in human DNA. Genes that are highly expressed have higher levels of intragenic methylation (IGM). It is hypothesized that IGM represses alternative transcription start sites and suppresses other, potentially harmful, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). In cancer cells, intragenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (decreased methylation) which causes genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes that contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Typically, the Igf2 gene is paternally expressed while the H19 gene is maternally expressed. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is normally methylated which prevents the CTCF insulator from binding and allows Igf2 to engage the enhancers and be expressed. Additionally, paternal ICR methylation causes silencing of the H19 promoter region and the H19 gene itself.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is normally <em>not</em> methylated. This allows the CTCF insulator to bind to the ICR. The CTCF insulator blocks the maternal Igf2 gene from engaging the enhancers and silences its expression. The lack of maternal ICR methylation also allows expression of the maternal H19 gene because the H19 promoter is <em>not</em> methylated.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, both the maternal and paternal ICRs are hypermethylated. Thus, both maternal and paternal alleles express the Igf2 gene causing overexpression. Imprinted genes, such as Igf2, are parent-of-origin specific and typically play big roles in the growth and development of the offspring. If these genes are overexpressed/underexpressed then they will disrupt crucial phases of development in the offspring, contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent sold by Eisai, a Japanese company. Decitabine can be incorporated into DNA strands and reduce the DNA methylation, but it cannot be incorporated into RNA strands. If DNA is hypermethylated (too much methylation) then tumour-suppressing gene promoter regions can become silenced, causing tumours to develop. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by demethylating promoter regions that are important for tumour suppression. This will cause the tumour suppressing genes to be expressed again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have immediate effects on the epigenome of the patient, but it can also have enduring effects on the patient and the patients offspring as well. Epigenetic marks are transmitted from parent to offspring, especially epigenetic marks of imprinted genes. Altering these marks in parents can cause alterations in the offspring that can continue to be passed to a third and fourth generation.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time during development when altered environments can have an effect on epigenetics. Specifically, the most sensitive periods are when the epigenome is being reset in the developing offspring. There are two main sensitive periods of development, one being primordial germ cell development and the other being during early cell development (gameteocytes, ooctyes, blastocysts, etc.). Treating patients during these sensitive periods can completely disrupt heritable epigenetic marks. For example, if a disruption to parent-of-origin specific imprinted genes occurs then offspring can have overexpression or underexpression of genes crucial to growth. Some of these disruptions can be passed down through multiple generations, hindering the development of grandchildren as well. Thus, treatment during sensitive periods is inadvisable.</p></div>
