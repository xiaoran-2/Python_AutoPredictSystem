    <h1>Submission 379 from Anon (session_user_id: 2bc1a0d4268cef9a17f6c1ba273bcd434e436983)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is described in the article “Cancer’s epicentre” (from The Economist) as one of the several drugs that can treat cancer. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which affects the epigenetic processes through hypomethylation.</p>
<p>It has been found that Decitabine plays a very important role in anti-metabolic and anticancer activities and also in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, when tested against various cancer cells. It was one of the first epigenetic drugs that were deployed successfully against solid tumours, such as lung cancer, which is harder to treat due to penetration of the drug. The participants that were not very responsive to the drug, showed an improvement in the reaction to the standard chemotherapeutic drugs thereafter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">In the The Economist's article "Cancer's epicentre", Dr Stephen Baylin describes how drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Unless the epigenetic changes are erased, they are passed along the way, through cell division, to daughter and granddaughter cells.</p>
<p>There are situations where the drugs that alter DNA methylation should be avoided. Sensitive periods are periods of development, in early life (prenatal and early years), where there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of the epigenetic mechanism. In younger patients, the drugs that alter DNA methylation are not recommender, during these periods, due to the fact that will inhibit the epigenetic machinery. Because of that, it will have effects on the development of that person.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal tissue of DNA methylation decreases as we progress from normal tissue to a methastatic tissue. In normal cells, the methylation at the CpG islands is at the lowest.</p>
<p> The CpG-island methylation increases from normal tissue, through the rest of the plasia phases of the cells and having the climax in the invasion phase. There are two abnormalities in the DNA methylation patterns that were identified with human cancer malignancies: hypermethylation and hypomethylation.</p>
<p> In a normal cell we will see a hypomethylation of the CpG island, so the methylation does not exist. To the contrast, the rest of the genome (including the repetitive elements, introns of gene and the intergenic regions) is methylated.</p>
<p> The cancer cells show a more likely methylated CpG islands (called hypermethylation), whereas the rest of the genome (including the repetitive elements, introns of gene and the intergenic regions) is hypomethylated, not methylated.</p>
<p> Hypermethylation of the CpG islands can silence tumour suppressor genes. This will allow the tumour to grow. As a general rule, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutation.</p>
<p> Genomic hypomethylation was the first abnormality that was to be noticed. In a cancer cell, it affects the encoding region, the repetitive elements, introns and the intergenic regions. Hypomethylation (of the repeats or intergenic regions) is affecting the stability of the genome. It will allow illegitimate recombination between the repeats (allowing reciprocal translocations), activation of the repeats and transposition and activation of the cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting control regions are unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, which means is paternally imprinted. Because it’s unmethylated on maternal allele, the imprinting region is bounded to a CTCF protein, which insulated the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers which are free to act on H19. This blocks the preferred chromatine looping of the enhancers which would have bound to Igf2 rather.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, because the imprinting control region is methylated, the CTCF protein cannot bind. It also spreads to the H19 region, methylating it. Because the imprinting region is methylated, the enhancers are acting on Igf2. The upregulation of the Igf2, which is an oncogene, will have effect on tumour growth promoting. Disrupting the methylation process, on the maternal allele, has as result the activation of the Igf2 gene. Having Igf2 genes active on both maternal and paternal alleles, increases the growth promoting of the tumour. As a result, there are many effects such as mutation or deletion that causes loss of imprinting; uniparental disomy where there are two copies of one parental chromosome; and also epigenetic disruption of loss of imprinting which occurs rare. In Wilm’s tumour, there is a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumour in the kidney. A symptom of the Wilm’s tumour is an abnormally large abdomen.</p>
