    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in normal cells are generally hypomethylated, with the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns being hypermethylated. In cancer cells, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, whereas, the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns are hypomethylated. Hypermethylation of CpG islands generally occur at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells. Cancer cells inactivate tumour suppressor genes either genetically or epigenetically. Epigenetic suppression of tumour suppressor genes occurs very frequently in tumours. Epimutations are rapidly selected and mitotically heritable. This allows the tumour cells to gain a competitive advantage over other cells in the area by being able to divide rapidly and not die. The suppression of tumour suppressor genes is thought to be one of the hits involved in the formation of tumours, in accordance with Knudson's hypothesis. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation occurs more frequently than mutations, they can vary by tumour type and progress over time. These traits can sometimes allow identification and prognosis of different cancers, through the use of biomarkers. The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated allowing genomic instability in the form of deletions, translocations and insertions of parts of chromosomes throughout the genome. The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetiitive elements can cause the expression of genes which would otherwise be repressed, resulting in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations of DNA methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) results in the loss of imprinting. This can occur through hyper- or hypo-methylation of the ICRs. Most imprinted genes are involved in cell growth in some way. A change in DNA methylation of the ICRs can result in over expression of growth promoting genes or suppression of growth restricting genes from both parental alleles. In the Igf2/H19 cluster of a normal cell, the maternal allele has an ummethylated ICR because it is bound by an insulator protein CTCF. This protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, resulting in Igf2 being silent. This allows the enhancers act on H19 to express it. The paternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR is methylated, allowing the enhancers to act directly on Igf2 to express it. H19 in the paternal allele is also methylated due to DNA methylation spreading from the ICR. In Wilm's tumour, the ICRs in both alleles are methylated leading to the expression of Igf2 from both the parental alleles. This results in a double dose of the growth promoter that Igf2 codes for being expressed.This occurs as a very early event in tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It's FDA approved and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds DNMTs into DNA. This is then passed on to the daughter strands of DNA when the cell divides. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, DNA methylation cannot take place. Considering cancer cells have a very high rate of cell division when compared to surrounding cells, the tumours are more severely affected by these DNMT inhibitors. When used at very high doses Decitabine is toxic and has no effect on the tumour, however at very low doses Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect and is not so toxic. Myelodysplastic patients tolerate the drug extremely well. In these patients the drug is effective against the tumours and also has little side effects. This is probably due to the fact that this drug may be CpGi hypermethylation dependent, which these myelodysplastic patients are. The long term effects are still unknown.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can result in genomic instability. For example, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, and CpG islands are usually unmethylated. In cancer cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated and the CpG islands are methylated, resulting in deletions, translocations and insertions of genes that should not be happening. Sensitive periods are times when the epigenome undergo resetting. This occurs at the preimplantation early development stage and during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients with epigennetic drugs during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable as these drugs not only affect the epigenetic state of the cancer cells but of the entire genome. This could result in long term unforeseen problems for the patient. It could also result in these unforeseen epigenetic aberations being transfered transgenerationally from parent to grandchild. It would be best to wait until the patient is in a state of somatic maintenance to administer these drugs to try to prevent transgenerational epimutations from being passed to future generations. </p></div>
