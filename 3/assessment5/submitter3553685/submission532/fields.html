    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>CpG islands can be found in promoters of tumour suppressor genes and are not normally methylated. In cancer, it has been found that the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated. DNA methylation into 5-methylcytosine at CpG islands is usually a 'silencing' mark, and is associated with a repressive chromatin structure.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation, as seen in cancer cell CpG islands, is mitotically heritable. This means that the aberrant DNA methylation is passed on to daughter cells. These epimutated cells can also have a selective advantage over other cells, as the machinery in place to ensure growth suppression (e.g. apoptosis and cell division inhibition) has been silenced by the suppression of the tumour suppressor genes, leading to cancer.  CpG island hypermethylation can occur in both single genes or in sets of genes, where it causes types of cancers known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>DNA in general is likely to be methylated at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements. These regions have been shown to become hypomethylated in cancer, meaning less DNA methylation in these regions. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation in the genome is known to maintain genomic stability, and hypomethylation leads to this genomic stability being lost. Genomic instability due to hypomethylation has been shown in both mouse models and in human disease. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>The consequences of this can be the illegitimate recombination between repeats, as without the DNA methylation these areas can become 'open' and repeats can misalign. The repeats can also copy themselves once they are hypomethylated, and this can lead to repeats becoming transposed into the genome, with the potential of disrupting a coding region or causing the activation of a neighbouring gene. This gene disruption can be one of the events of the 'Knudsen' hypothesis, activating an oncogene or silencing a tumour suppressor gene.</span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>The Igf2/H19 cluster consists of a number of different loci. The imprint control region (ICR) for this cluster lies between the Igf2 and H19 loci, and the enhancers lie downstream of the H19 loci. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which means the insulator protein CTCF does not bind to it. This means that the enhancers are free to act on the Igf2 locus and therefore Igf2 is transcribed. However, on the maternal allele, this ICR is not methylated and CTCF binds. The enhancers can no longer act at the Igf2 locus, and instead are free to act on H19 enhancing expression. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>Loss of parent of origin specific imprinted marks can occur at this cluster with the methylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele. This hypermethylation means that the CTCF insulator protein can no longer interact with the ICR, and therefore there is no block for the enhancers. The result is that the maternal allele will behave like a paternal allele, by expressing Igf2 and no H19. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, and this overexpression of Igf2 is associated with Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tumour. </span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, which means that it inhibits the actions of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Decitabine is a nuceloside analogue and is incorporated into the DNA. During replication, it binds to DNMT1 irreversibly and the DNMT cannot be released. In an adult, DNMT1 is required for the maintenance of the silencing methyl marks during cell division, with hemi-methylated DNA being the substrate for this enzyme. DNMTi's act to inhibit this DNA methylation, effectively diluting the DNA methylation with every cell division and having an overall demethylating effect. This relieves the silencing on the CpG islands, and on any genes that were silenced due to this methylation (including tumour suppressor genes), therefore having an anti-tumour effect. </span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark which is responsible for silencing genes. By altering these 'silencing' marks, the expression pattern of the genome can be altered. As the epigenetic marks are usually maintained, these would be mitotically inherited, leading to altered expression patterns in all of the daughter cells. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;"><span>A sensitive period of development is a period of heightened epigenetic sensitivity, a time when epigenetic marks on the DNA are likely to be removed or layed down. There are a number of sensitive periods during development – during the reprogramming in the formation of gametes, and in early embryo development – therefore, during early pregnancy for a mother or pre-conception. The Overkalix study has indicated a sensitive period during the slow growth period of pre-puberty also. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"> <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;">Treating a patient during a sensitive period would be inadvisable for a number of reasons. Removing methylation and activating genes in normal cells could also cause cancer (by activating oncogenes) therefore they should be used with caution.  </span></p></div>
