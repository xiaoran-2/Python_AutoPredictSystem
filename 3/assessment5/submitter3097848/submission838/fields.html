    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control (as a promoters) during mammalian development and normally unmethylated (genes active). If the CpG island is methylated, it silence gene expression, best example is X inactivation.</li>
<li>DNA methylation of CpG island is hypermethylated in cancer. It silences the tumour suppressor gene epigeneticly or geneticly.</li>
<li>Because of the inactive tomour suppressor genes, the cell continue to divide without control.</li>
<li>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions are maintaining genomic integrity, ex :<br />    - Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability<br />    - Silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites <br />Repetitive elements also maintain genomic integrity and play a role as a genome defense model to protect genome from transposeable element. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated (genes silence). 
<p>Maintain genomic intergrity (repetitive elements) :<br />    – silencing the repeats (IAP) to prevent transposition and avoid transcription interference from strong promoters<br />    – mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition <br />    – silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters <br />    – methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination</p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>In cancer cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements both loss methylation (hypomethylation). But the consequence of hypomethylation is really depends on location. And hypomethylation is most occurring at repetitive elements and rare in other places. So, the genes that normally silence in normal cell becoming  active in cancer cell.</li>
<li>Because hypomethylation most occurring at repetitive elements, it will cause abnormal karyotype due to genomic instability that can lead to cancer.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Imprint Control Region (ICR) in H19/lgf2 cluster is methylated on paternal allele, the Insulator protein that insulate lgf2 from enhancers (CTCF) can't bind in this ICR. Because of the absent of CTCF binding on ICR, the DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and make the H19 silence. The enhancers (located downstream H19 promoter) now can't access H19 but access the lgf2 to activate. </li>
<li>On maternal allele, the ICR in H19/lgf2 is not methylated so CTCF can bind. No DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter. The downstream enhancers can't access the lgf2 because of the present of CTCF on ICR. The enhancers now access the H19 to activate. The lgf2 status is silence.</li>
<li>On paternal side there's loss of imprinting H19 and on maternal side there's loss of imprinting lgf2. Wilm's tumour is because of overdose of expression of lgf2 and H19 (biallelic expression).</li>
<li>Overdose of the expression of lgf2 and H19 cause aberrant developing on child kidney that may lead to Wilm's tumour.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> cerAltering DNA methylation really can have long lasting effects on epigenome because DNA methylation is mitocally heritable.</li>
<li>There are 2 sensitive periods in mammals to environmental change. First period is during primordial germ cell to the production of mature germ cell. The second is pre-implantation and early post implantation period.</li>
<li>Both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome, that is when epigenetic marks (such DNA methylation) are removed and laid down.</li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because e<span>pigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. So it's possible the drug's effect will affect the offspring by passage through germ cells.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is drug for the treatment of myelodisplastic syndromes (<span>a group of conditions in which the bone marrow produces blood cells that are misshapen and does not produce enough healthy blood cells)</span>, <span>the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></li>
<li>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It unmethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase to DNA strands.</li>
<li>Decitabine can have an anti tumour effect indirectly by targeting substance called JQ1 which inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocks the activity of Myc gene that goes wrong in cancer.</li>
