    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> In  cancer,  there is a hypermethylation  in CpG islands, and it is observed that a tumor, or invasion progresses  with time.  So, as you can see, the result of hypermethylation is the silence of determined genes, which they are tumour suppressor genes, so that´s the relationship between cancer and this silencing of these genes.  Unfortunately, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, but these epimutations are reversible, in comparision with mutations directly in DNA.  But in the case, of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, we can observe and hypomethylation, leading to genomic instability. An that is because, these areas of the genome become active, and for result there can be insertions, deletions, recombination of the chromosome due to the repetitive elements and the similitary of these regions on the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes involved in imprinting, function as growth promoter. That´s why cancer is related with loss of imprinting.  So in the case of  the H19/Igf2 cluster, when we have the maternal and paternal allele, the normal situation is when we have the H19 and CTCF paternal allele methylated, and for that reason there is an expression of IgF2. In contrast with the maternal allele, which in this case they are not methylated, and IgF2 does not express. But in Wilm´s tumour, both alleles are methylated, which leads to enhancer to interact with Igf2 and both alleles express IgF2, Wilm´s tumour is a common tumor in the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitiabne is one of the drugs approved of FDA, and their function is focused on DNMTi,</p></div>
