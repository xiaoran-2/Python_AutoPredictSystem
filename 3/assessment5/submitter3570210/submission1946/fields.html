    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands are hypomethylated but in cancer, they are often found to be hypermethylated.  These CpG islands are located in about 60% of gene promoters.  In the case of tumor supressing genes, this locus-specific hypermethylation of the promoter region in effect silences these tumor suppresors allowing the cancer to grow by disrupting functions such as the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  In contrast, there is normally a higher level of methylation genome-wide at intergenic regions and repetitive elements and to a lesser extent in CpG-poor promoters.  In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetive elements are found to be hypomethylated.  This swapping of DNA methylation towards increase at CpG islands and decrease genome-wise is somewhat normal and happens over time but in cancer, it is quite marked and can be evidence of the progression of the disease.  Genome-wide hypomethylation can open up the chomatin that would normally be tightly packed increasing genomic instability by allowing, for example, for repeats to be expresed which could result in deletions, insertions, and translocations.  The means that oncogenes could be improperly activated or the proper expression of tumor suppressing genes would be disrupted.  Both mechanisms which cause cancer.  Since DNA methylation is found to be mitotically heritable, this makes for a quite effective mechanism for preserving the improper methylation patterns in subsequent daughter cells and therefore promotes the progression of the cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>With the exception of the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, DNA methylation is found to be mitotically heritable and therefore a quite stable epigenetic mark.  In cases where the tumor is driven by tumor suppresing hypermethylation, reversing hypermethylation is desired.  But for other types of tumors of during sensitive perriods, this would be inadvisable.  The sensitive periods of reprogramming occur during early embrionyc development, primordial germ cell development and during some tissue specific cell differentiation.  As in the case of the laying down of imprinted genes or directing X inactivation, "proper" DNA methylation maintains genomic stability and ensures the correct expression of genes which direct viable embryonic development, as well as the correct tissue differentiation, the eventual tissue specific functions in the somatic cells, and proper imprinting of primordial germ cells.  Any drug that alters the reprograming process at any of these stages by disrupting the proper laying down of DNA methylation and promoting genomic instability, could disrupt the development of the embryo potentially causing birth defects (or worse) or creating permanent epigenetic changes that can eventually impair organ funtion in adult somatic cells and lead to cancers or other diseases.  (Only sources used are course videos and assigned readings)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the marternally imprinted gene, the ICR is unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind to it.  CTCF normally acts as an insulating agent, preventing the enhancers found downstream from acting to express Igf2, and they instead act on the H19 region.  In the paternally imprinted gene, the ICR is methylated preventing CTCF from binding to it.  The H19 region is also methylated.  In this allele, the enhancers are able to act to promote Igf2 expression.   In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation in the ICR of the maternal allele also prevents CTCF binding at the ICR, and there is also methylation of H19.  This causes both alleles to in effect act as the paternally imprinted allele would, causing over-expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoter that contributes to the growth of kidney tumors in children.  This happens at a very early stage of the disease, before the tumor itself might be evident.  (Only sources used are course videos and assigned readings)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It has been shown to removes the acumulated DNA methylation in tumors.  Since this demethylation is then inherited by the daughter cells, tumor progression is slowed until these cells are "erased". Even though it does not kill the tumore cells, for tumors driven by tumor suppressing hypermethylation, it may slow or reverse the overall growth of the tumor as well as make it more likely that chemotherapy will be more effective by making the tumors more suceptible to the chemo drugs.  (Only sources used are course videos and assigned readings)</p>
