    <h1>Submission 782 from Anon (session_user_id: be0446cf3d2016589589459ded438d558a3b3404)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. It can make DNA hypomethylated. Since many tumors are caused by abnormal DNA hypermethylation, <span>Decitabine can inhibit DNA methyltransferases to reduce abnormal DNA hypermethylation. So after <span> Decitabine treatment, those DNAs can function well and the proliferation of tumor cells can be slow down. </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is inheritable and  it will maintain in the off-springs until it is removed or altered under certain circumstance. It may affect the regulation and expression of genes or tissue differentiation. The altering is dynamic and it makes the epignome alter dynamically under different environment. So drugs that alter DNA methylation may have effects on certain physiological processes inheritably, and this alteration will maintain unless there is a disruption of the altering. <br />During the development, there is a sensitive period, during which epigenetic marks, e.g. DNA methylation, will be cleared and reset. This epigenetic reprogramming period happens in early embryo development and primordial germ cells development and has variant effects on gene expression or tissue diffferentiation. Also, this resetting during sensitive periods is inheritable, which will maintain in off-springs.<br />For the treatment of drugs that altering DNA methylation, it is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, because drugs will altering DNA methylation that involved in the epigenetic reprogramming process and have effects on the epigenetic clearing and resetting, leading to altering of gene expression or tissue differentiation that may have severe consequences,e.g. cancer. Since DNA methylation is inheritable, this disruption of epigenome during sensitive periods wil have long-lasting effects on patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation at CpG islands is generally silencing promoters of genes to inhibit their expression and CpG islands of tumor repressor genes are always hypomethylated. However, in cancer cells, DNA hypermethylation is always found at CpG islands of tumor repressor genes which controlling cell growth, DNA repair and so on. This makes these genes malfunction, for example, cell cycles lose control, DNA damage can not be repaired and cells can not go apoptosis, thus,cancer cells can grow without control. Also,DNA methylation is always found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells, these areas contain transposons, satellite repeats and transcription regulatory regions which control gene expression. DNA methylation of these regions helps keep the genome stable and regulate specific genes. But, in cancer cells, DNA hypomethylation is always found at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which makes the genome unstable and gene deregulation. For example, disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions, which are often function as regulatory areas for the expression of genes flanking them, can deregulate the expression of certain genes which may control important cellular process,such as cell proliferation,apoptosis and so on. DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements can make the genome unstable which will cause a high frequency of mutations within the genome and these mutations can easily cause certain diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is that certain genes express in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. These genes often regulate cell growth and are critical for development. Thus, disruption of imprinting sometimes causes cancer. For example, in normal cells, H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinting.The imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated, so CTCF, which is an insulator protein, can not bind to this region. This causes downstream enhancers can activate lgf2 for its expression. On the contrary, H19 promoter is silent because of the spreading of DNA methylation. For the maternal allele, imprint control region of H19/lgf2 is not methylated. CTCF can bind to this region and insulates downstream enhancers to prevent enhancers from accessing lgf2,so lgf2 can not be actived and expressed. CTCF binding also active H19 promoter. However, in Wilm's tumour, imprint control regions of the H19/lgf2 cluster is hypermethylated, this makes ICR on both maternal and paternal allleles are methylated. lgf2 on the maternal allele can also be active and expressing, so that Igf2, which is a growth factor, overexpresses in Wilm's tumour. Excessive Igf2 will promote cells proliferation without limitation, which may cause tumour formation.</p></div>
