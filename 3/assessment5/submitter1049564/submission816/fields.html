    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark regulating gene expression. Spread through the genome, usually at specific regions on a promoter sequence, are contained areas with an higer than expected Cytosine-Guanine (CpG) content (called CpG islands or CGIs). Because of chemical modification, methylation leads to the silencing of the genes whose promoters are interested by this process.</p>
<p>In cancer, a global reduction of Cytosine methylation and hypermethylation of CGIs are observed: this fact may induce a completely altered gene expression at cellular level (i.e.: silencing of a tumor suppressor gene, enhancing the proliferation rate of the cell).</p>
<p>It has been observed that CGIs hypermethylation is a very common feature of several types of tumors, leading to the uncontrolled suppression of gene expression: this process can act exactly as a point mutation affecting the function of a gene product and can be considered as one of the possible hits in the Knudson's hypothesis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is usually strictly regulated and its function is fundamental to silence whole genomic areas of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. These regions are residues of genome evolution and can still contain masked promoters or pseudo-genes or can be sites of abnormal recombination processes: if not silenced, as it happens in cancer because of the global DNA hypomethylation, these regions may completely alter the genome regulation and cellular functions.</p>
<p>A globally altered recombination process can lead to cytogenetic and chromosomical modifications, frequently found in cancer. On the other hand, the activation of hypomethylated repetitive elements may disrupt or activate genes across that region, bring to transposition, replicate and aument the overall number of these elements. Finally, hypmethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to inappropriate gene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleotide analog that inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) functions, leading to a global genomic hypomethylation. Its use is now accepted in the treatment of myelodisplastic syndrome.</p>
<p>It acts inserting modified nucleotides in DNMT genes, so that its functions are replications dependent: because cancer cells are expected to have an higher proliferative rate, their effects are therefore more sensible in neoplastic cells than in normal healthy cells. It was unsuccesfully used in the '70s: at that time, much higher doses were used, silencing this tumor-specific function and leading to highly toxic effects. Nowadays, a much lower dose is succesfully used.</p>
<p>Decitabine effects are linked to a generalised and unspecific genomic demethylation due to the suppressed DNMTs function. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands regulating specific genes in cancer is known, but how a completely deregulated suppression of gene silencing can lead to reduced cellular growth rate is unknwon.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are inheritable from daughter cells through mytosis. For this reason, epigenetic modifications are not limited just to the treated cells but to all the future cells evolving from the treated ones.</p>
<p>If the modifications we are producing make the cells more sensitive to cehmoterapic drugs, we have induced cellular modifications that make the organism more resistant to cancer development even without treating all of the neoplastic cells.</p>
<p>During epigenetic regulation there are two periods of global epigenetic modifications: embryonic development and germ cells development. These processes are sensitive and can lead to an inappropriate modification in cellular genomic regulation. Unspecific epigenetic modifications induced during this period are very dangerous because we don't knoe how we are modifying gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans, some genes are differently expressed depending on which chromosome do they lay, the maternal or the paternal one. For example,on the chromosome 11p, two genes are differently expressed depending on the parental origin of the chromosome where they lay: IgF2 and H19.</p>
<p>The paternal gene is methylated upstream of H19, silencing this gene and allowing IgF2 expression.</p>
<p>The maternal gene is not methylated upstream of H19, so that CTCF (a transcriptional factor acting as an insulator as well) leads to H19 expression and IgF2 silencing.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that, in a sensible percentage (almost 50%) of Wilm's tumours (a renal tumour), this specific maternal methylation pattern is lost, leading to two "paternal-like" chromosome over-expressing this IgF2 . No maternal-like H19 expressing chromosome is still present in these cells.</p>
<p>IgF2 is a growth factor inducing cellular proliferation and is overexpressed in Wilm's cells, being one of the steps leading to cancer development.</p></div>
