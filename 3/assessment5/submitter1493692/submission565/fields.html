    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. The DNA hypermethylation, especially at tumor suppressor promoters, silences the gene expression which can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis for tumorogenesis. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is hypomethylated. This genome-wide hypomethylation results in genomic instability including recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptiv promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated which block the binding of CTCF insulator. The DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence its expression and enhancers have access to lgf2 which activate its expression. In the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated which makes CTCF access to this locus. CTCF insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers which silence lgf2 expression but activate the expression of H19. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR at H19/lgf2 locus is hypermethylated, which  activates the expression of lgf2 from maternal allele and therefore leads to overexpression of lgf2. lgf2 is related with cell growth and proliferation. lgf2 overepxression could result in tumor growth.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It will act as nucleoside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after it incorporateing into DNA which inhibit DNA methylation during DNA replication. Decitabine could inhibit tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation which can have an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 in a replication-dependent manner. Altering DNA methylation could not only change the methylation status in the cells that are treated. The alteration could also be passed to the daughter cells and obtain one strand from mother cells. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming during which alteration or removal of the normal process result in epigenetic abnormalities. During development, there are two sensitive periods: early development and PGC and GC development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable is because the drugs would either interfere the normal early development of embryo or result in aberrant gene imprinting during PGC and GC development which would pass the defects to the next generation.</p></div>
