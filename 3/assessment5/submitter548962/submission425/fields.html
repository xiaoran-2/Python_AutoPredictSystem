    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In the past decade, evidence has emerged that cancer cell-specific epigenetics, in particular DNA methylation, could be differentiated between diseased cells and healthy cells.</p>
<ul><li>In normal cells clusters of guanine-cytosine pairs, so-called CpG islands, are under methylated (or hypomethylated). CpG islands are typically found in gene promoters and act as a switch to turn the promoter on or off. Genes with hypomethylated CpG islands are expressed.</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, causing genes to be silenced.</li>
<li>The genes specifically silenced are tumour suppressor genes, which are used to repress the cell cycle or promote apoptosis so a cell doesn't enter a cancerous state.</li>
<li>Methylation at CpGs is outnumbered by methylation that that occurs at intergenic regions, stretches of DNA that possess few or no genes, and repetitive elements, repeating patterns of DNA. In healthy cells, these regions and elements are hypermethylated in healthy cells.</li>
<li>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethlyated. </li>
<li>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause mistakes to happen, dependent on location, that causes genomic instability. This instability increases the chances that mutations will occur that lead to cancer.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A diagnosis of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome comes with an increased risk of childhood cancer. This disease is unique because it has an epigenetic origin, specifically a disorder in the way that genes are imprinted.</p>
<ul><li>In healthy cells, the paternal allele and maternal allele of the<strong> </strong>H19/Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 (Igf2) gene cluster have different methylation patterns on the imprint control region that ensures that the right amount of the gene is expressed. In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, which spreads to silence nearby H19, a gene used to produce a long non-coding RNA. Enhancers downstream of H19 are then free to access Igf3 and activate its expression.</li>
<li>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated, allowing for H19 to be expressed and a protein insulator called CTCF to block the enhancers from reaching Igf2, silencing its expression. </li>
<li>Disruption of H19/Igf2 imprint control region methylation can lead to cancer, such as a Wilm's tumour. In a Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, so there is hypermethylation. </li>
<li>Hypermethlaiton or having just one Igf2/H19 allele can lead to overexpression of Igf2, a growth factor. </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is a recent push by pharmaceutical companies to develop epigentic drugs that are meeting with measurable clinical success.</p>
<ul><li>One example if Decitabine, FDA-approved and sold as Dacogen, which is a DNMTi.</li>
<li>Decitabine is a small molecule that inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferase, proteins that add methylayion marks to the DNA.</li>
<li>The mechanisms of how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect are unclear, however, as tumour suppresor genes are hypermethalted in cancer, it's assumed that the drug is blocking hypermethylation from taking place when a cancer cell divides, and thus repressing the tumour. </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The science of epigenetics has taught us that changes in your genome can be passed on from generation to generation.</p>
<ul><li>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. When a cell divides, the epigenetic marks of the parent cell are added to the DNA of the daughter cells, who in turn pass them down to their daughter cells. Some epigenetic marks are part of a specific imprint control region, and are passed down from parent to child.</li>
<li>A sensitive period in epigenetics is when methylation and other epigenetic marks are being either removed or laid down.</li>
<li>There are two epigenetic sensitive periods: the time from primordial germ cell development to production of mature eggs and sperm and the time from pre-implantation to early post-implantation.</li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as changes in the patients' epigenetics could cause more disease in their lifetime, render them infertile, or increase the chance of disease in the patients' offspring. </li>
