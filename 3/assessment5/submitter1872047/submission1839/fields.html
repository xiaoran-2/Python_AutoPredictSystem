    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpGs. Normally CpG islands can be located around gene promoters where gene transcription machinery binds. DNA at CpG islands tends to be protected from methylation. Genes with unmethylated CpG islands are actively expressed. In contrast, when CpG islands are methylated, this results in genes being silenced.</p>
<p>Although methylation varies in different tumour types, generally in cancer CpG islands are methylated. Methylated CpG islands are found at the promoter of tumour suppressor gene. This leads in tumour cells dividing rapidly.</p>
<p>As normal methylation process is disrupted in cancer, this does not just affect CpG islands but the rest of genome is affected too.  While CpG islands in cancer are methylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions become unmethylated. Unmethylated genome loses its stability and might in consequence lead to developing an abnormal karyotype – deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions are very likely to occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, maternal allele has insulation over the ICR which is unmethylated, this leads to enhancers acting on H19, long-non coding RNA gene and leaves the lgf2 silent.</p>
<p>In a paternal normal cell this process is quite different. ICR has not got any insulation thus is methylated. The enhancers then act straight on Igf2 instead of acting on H19, lncRNA gene. Igf2 is activated.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated the same, i.e. ICR and H19 are methylated which results in enhancers activating Igf2, the growth promoting gene.</p>
<p>The overexpression of Igf2 gene promotes tumour growth in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is hypomethylating drug. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine has a big effect on regulating dysfunctional epigenome in cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine chemically is very similar to components found in DNA and RNA. During DNA replication and RNA transcription cells include Decitabine into their structure because of molecule similarity. This process inhibits methyltransferase and results in hypomethylation or demethylation of DNA in that region.</p>
<p>As Decitabine is a demethylating drug it can act on silenced tumour suppressor genes making them active again which in turn would reduce the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have an impact on epigenome. Methylation is responsible for packaging chromatin, i.e. whether it tightly packaged or not. This in consequence has an impact on which genes are silenced or activated. Methylated chromatin tends to be heterochromatin, tightly packaged and not very susceptible to transcription. Whereas euchromatin is less tightly packaged and is more readily transcribed. This might explain why solid tumours, that have DNA methylated and tightly packaged, are less susceptible to chemotherapy. Drugs that Dr Baylin mentions makes tumour DNA less densely compacted and more susceptible to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods in early development when epigenetic marks are cleared and epigenome is reprogrammed. Germ cell development and early embryonic development are particularly sensitive periods.  They are called ‘sensitive’ because any disruption to epigenetic reprogramming may result in epigenetic abnormalities. One of such disruptions might me a treatment of cancer with any kind of drugs but especially methylation-based.</p></div>
