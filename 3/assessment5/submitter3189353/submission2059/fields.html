    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyaltion at the CpG islands in a normal cell is an epigenetic modification allowing to scilence or inactivate the gene not allowing it to transcribe. This is an important procells allowing the cell to maintain genomic stability and occurs at differents ways including embryonic development, genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. In cancerous cells DNA methylation at the CpG island is more resulting in hypermethylation. Hypermethylation at these islands results in loss of expression of the tumor supressor genes thus guiding the cell to be tumerogenic. Hypermethylation at the CpG islands increase with the time and might adversly effect. Scientists suggest that this hypermethylation might not only contribute to cancer which would also need epimutatons for its effect towards cancer. CpG hypermethylation is mitotically heritable eventually giving rise to more number of cells with the tumor supressing properties. DNA methylation at the intergenic and repetitive elements in normal cells is generally hign as they are not expressive genes. These sites being methylated helps the DNA from mutations and maintaining stability. The repetitive DNA would be stable and do not jump from one site to the other. In cancerous cells the DNA at theses regions is hypomethylated allowing them to express creating genome instability. These are first identified epigenetic marks, which starts to happen at the early stages. The hypomethylation at the repetitive DNA occurs more often. the hypomethylation of these regions results in reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions thus making the cell loose its stability and thus cancerous. Hypomethylation at the promoters is less common. Interonic regions if hypomethylated might result in miRNA synthesis which might repress the mRNA such as tumor supressing one and resulting in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and IGF2 exists as a cluster controlled by same enhancers. In general the paternal allele in a normal cells is methylated at the CTCF ICR region and the H19 gene, hence the enhancers activates the igf2 and thus its expression. In the maternal allele the CTCF ICR region and the H19 region are not methylated, so the enhancers allow the expression of H19. Here H19 is expressed as the ifg2 gene is upstream to the H19 gene and hence if the H19 gene is activated Igf2 gene can not get activated. In case of the Wilm's tumour the imprinting in both the paternal and the maternal allele occurs. both the alleles are hypermethylated at the ICRs. Hypermethylation allows the expression og the Igf2 in both the alleles as H19 is methylated and enhancers activate the expression of Igf2 but not H19. This occurs in the early stages particulary observed in pre-neoplastic tissues. both the paternal and maternal alleles behave the same because of hypermethylation and eventually disturbing the imprinting process.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug designed by Eisai, a Japanese company. It fall into a class of demethylating agent. It is an epigenetic inhibitor of its activity of hypomethylating the DNA. The drug inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferases. once the DNA methyltrasferases are inhibited  the cell do not have the ability to transfer the methyl group on the DNA. The anti-tumor effect of this drug is because it can take care of the hypermethylated tumour supressor genes. The tumour supressor genes are hypermethylated in cancer and hence inactive. so if this drug is used in such cases it depletes methylation of the DNA and allows these supressor genes to be active and hence the supress the tumours</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable. With the help of this property if the cancerous cells are treated with the DNA methylation altering drugs it would help control the spread of methylation effcets on the daughter cells and on cells on eventual division. hence use of the epigenetic drugs would always have enduring effects on cancer. Sensitive periods are where the genomic imprinting occurs along with the X-inactivation generally during the embryonic development and the gonal development. the sensitive periods can be identified as the preimplantation periods and the primordial germ cell developments stages. During these sensitive periods the methylation is generally removed and later reinstalled according to the need of the cell, X-inactivation, imprinting of genes and on repeats. All these processes aid in genomic stability and if the drugs are administered during these periods the cells would loose the genomic stability and integrity further damaging.</p></div>
