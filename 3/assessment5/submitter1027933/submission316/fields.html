    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Tpically CpG islands are hypomethylated as they are upstream from gene promotors .</p>
<p>The function of DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands is to silence the downstream promotors of genes in most cases .</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG at Cpg islands is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, via Mcp 1 and 2, having a binding DNA domain and transcrtional depression domain . Mcp proteins recruit chromatin condensing facotra . This is mitotically heritable due to features of Dnmts.</p>
<p>In cancer DNA hypermethylation of an CpG island commonly leads to the suppression of a downstream promotor, if this is a growth suppressor gene that is silenced it may lead to over growth  of cells .</p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease as the genes arent acting within normal parameters . Due to altered methylation there maybe under or over expression of genes . </p>
<p> Intergenic regions are typically hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability ie. prevent deletions, insertions translocations and reciprocal translocations There is silencing of cryptic promotor transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites</p>
<p> DNA methylation is typically hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements  in cancer . This increases the probably of deletions, insertions, translocations and reciprocal translocations . Normal functioning genes may have additional pieces of repetitive elements inserted into them  altering their normal function . Parts of genes maybe removed  or swapped with other chromosomes . All this effects alter the expression of genes and the function of the genome as a whole . </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease .  There is altered gene expression, there maybe  genes that are no longer expressed because of an repetitive element insertion or deletion . Crypic sites, splicer start sites maybe altered so RNA polyermase attachment sites are no longer functioning . </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitane is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi),  nuceloside analogue, ie. incorpated into the DNA during replication.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1 during mitosis . It layes down methylation to the daughter strand to match the parent strand during replication . By introducing Decitane it is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released . The daughter strand is prevented from being methylated.</p>
<p>During the next cell division the unmethylated daughter strand ( 2nd generation )  becomes the unmethylated parent strand so that during the cell division there is no methylation of CpG sites of the new daughter strand ( 3rd generation )</p>
<p>Recently at much lower doses the DNMTi have a good antitumor effect as they are in the correct range and appear to cause DNA demethylation . However  all cells divide throughout the body though at different rates there probably is an affect on all cells to a degree . Typically Decitane is used in patients of advancing age where germ cell and sensitive periods have passed</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has imprinted expression . There is methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) , which means CTCF cant bind to the ICR . The methylation from the ICR spreads downstream into the H19 promotor and silences it . The paternal allele has igf2 expression .There is no methylation on the maternal allele and Igf2 expression doesnt occur </p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene  ie. growth promotor </p>
<p>In Wilms tumor there is an increase in Igf2 expression.  </p>
<p>Causes maybe  </p>
<p>1. The maternal allele may have a mutation, deletion of the ICR  . This may cause Igf2 expression from the maternal allele </p>
<p>2. Two copies of the fathers allele maybe inherited so there is both alleles expressing Igf2</p>
<p>3. Epigenetic disruption of the alleles .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster imprinting disruption contributes to disease .</p>
<p>If H19 isnt expressed on the maternal allele the preferred chromatin loop occurs and Igf2 expression occurs . This leads to too much Igf2 as its being expressed from both the paternal and maternal allele .</p>
<p>If both paternal alleles are inherited there is Igf2 expressed from both alleles.</p>
<p>Any increase in Igf2 encourages the likihood of disease through promoting the abnormal amount of cell growth .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As discussed in question 3 -  when DNA methylation is altered, its mitotically inheritably changed for following generations of cell divisions . As in the above example of Decitabine, methylation is removed in further generations .Tumor cells undergo more generational division than normal cells, in the case of Decitane it would have many more times the opportunity to remove the methylation  as there is more mitotic division with tumor cells .</p>
<p>This may effect the following mechanisms </p>
<p>Unsilencing previously silenced  genes that are growth inhibitors</p>
<p>May cause genomic instability by removing methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements . Allowing the increased possibility of deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations . </p>
<p>A sensitive  period is when reprogramming occurs . During the preimplantation period of the embryo and mid gestation for primordial germ cell development ..There also is further germ cell development prepuberty  .</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as the epigenetic machinery is being targeted by the epigenetic drugs  . As the epigenetic machinary is very active at this point in removing/ laying down new epigenetic marks .it would lead to large and lifelong changes in the epigenome . These epigentic drugs are more suitable for older patients where survival is the main indicator rather than long term epigenomic changes .</p>
