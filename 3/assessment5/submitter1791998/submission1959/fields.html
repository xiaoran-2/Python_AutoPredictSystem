    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is achieved when adding a methyl group to a cytosine that is usually followed by a guanine (hence the name CpG) which results in gene silencing. This silencing of genes is crucial in cell differentiation, and embryonic development.  </p>
<p>Because CpG methylation is essential to genetic stability and well-being, any abnormalities in said process can have lethal consequences. In fact, in cancer cells, it has been found that most CpG sites are very likely to be methylated (CpG hypermethylation) compared to normal cells. It is possible that this hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes. This silencing of tumor supressor genes is what contributes to the development of tumors.</p>
<p>When it comes to intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements, they seem to be hypomethylated which is not the case in normal cells. The effect of hypomethylation greatly depends on its location: when repeats or intergenic regions are affected, this leads to genomic instability and when  CpG poor promoters are hypomethylated this can lead to oncogene activation. </p>
<p>It must be said that genomic instability  due to hypomethylation (which can lead to silencing or activation of genes, repeats and transpositions as well as Illegitimate recombination between repeats) does not only lead to cancer but also a myriad of different human diseases. For instance, a mutation caused by a disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the gene DNMT3B results in the disease Immunodeficiency, Centromere instability and Facial anomalies syndrome (ICF).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the imprint control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele is unmethylated. Because it is unmethylated the CTFC will bind to the imprint control region and consequently, the enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silenced.  On the other hand, n the paternal allele, the imprint control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster  is methylated so the CTFC will not bind to it. This leads to the enhancers acting upon Igf2 and therefore having it expressed.  </p>
<p>In a Wilm’s tumour, the imprint control region on the maternal allele is also methylated (hypermethylation) due to loss of imprinting. This leads to the expression of Igf2 (due to the enhancers) on both the maternal and paternal allele. Since Igf2 is associated with growth promoting, its overexpression can lead to cancer.   </p>
<p>That said, Wilm's tumour is not the only malignant tumor caused by disrupted imprinting. Indeed, any alteration in DNA methylation at Imprint control regions whether it be hypomethylation or hypermethylation will result in the  overexpression of growth promoting genes or the expression of growth restricting genes and therefore contribute to disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (also know as a hypomethylating agent or DNMTi).  As its name suggests, the drug inhibits DNA methyltransferase and can therefore activate previously silenced genes (hypermethylated genes). This particular drug, as well as another DNA-demethylating agent, Azacitidine, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that progressed to <span> acute myelogenous leukaemia</span> (AML). Decitabine’s anti-neoplastic effect relating to epigenetics is the following: it hypomethylates previously silenced tumor suppressor genes. By having active tumor suppressor genes, cell growth is brought back to normal. That said, Decitabine also interferes with the cell’s metabolism by being an antimetabolites which induces death of the tumor cells.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. Therefore, any epigenetic change that the drug induces will be present in the daughter cells, grand-daughter cells and so forth. Indeed, the epigenetic mark will continue to be passed on until it is removed through another epigenetic process. That said, when they are removed, it is a permanent deletion (so the epigenetic mark does not come back after a few cell divisions).  </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming (Pre-implantation period early development and primordial germ cell development are both very sensitive periods of development).  During these sensitive periods, epigenetic marks are being laid down to enable healthy and normal growth. Since these drugs affect every cell in the patients body, they will most likely interefere with the epigenetic reprogramming occurring at the time and cause epigenetic anomalies that can be fatal.</p>
<p>In short, because altering DNA methylation has lasting effects on the epigenome, any drug that claims to do so should be avoided on patients undergoing epigenetic reprogramming (sensitive periods) because the marks that are established due to the treatment will interefere with the normal epigenetic changes occuring.   </p></div>
