    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities seen in cancer: hyper and hypomethylation. While in normal cells CpG islands are unmethylated and intronic regions of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements do are; the pattern in a cancer cell is entirely invested. Concretely:</p>
<p>- CpG islands: In normal cells this regions are promoters of genes activation and when they are methylated usually cause the inactivation of the gene. In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated silencing tumour suppressor genes and triggering the oncogenesis. This kind of tumour suppressor genes hypermethylation is in deed more frequent than mutations, varies by type of tumour and are increased with age. Because all of these reasons, CpG islands are actually considered as interesting biomarkers to diagnose, prognose and monitoring cancer; only with a lower efficacy than CpG islands shore hypermethylated regions.</p>
<p>- Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells and correlate with genomic inestability causing deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions in a normal karyotype. The reason of the correlate is that in normal cells methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements make these regions more <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">inaccessible to express. However, if the strenght of methylation decreased, both type of regions </span></span>are <span lang="en" xml:lang="en"><span class="hps">accessible</span></span>, facilitating their expression which are related with oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of Igf2 expression into a normal cell, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated while in the maternal allele is unmethylated. For this reason the enhacers act in the maternal H19 copy, inactivating it. In contrast, the methylation of the paternal ICR make possible the expression of the paternal Igf2 copy. The loss of imprinting (eg. Wilm's tumour) cause that the maternal allele is methylated and it's expressed. Igf2 is related whith growth and having extra copies of him derivate in overexpression and in the development of Wilm's tumour, a kidney type of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent ( a type of agents known as DNMT inhibitors). Depends on the dose -low or high - it could have antineoplastic effect causing DNA demethylation or become toxic with non specific effect. Decitabine acts like a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase 1 after they are incorporated to the DNA. It can have anti-tumour effect, demethylating in abnormal cells the hypermethylathed CpG islands and causing the re-activation of tumour suppressor genes.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetics marks ara passed on during cell division trough daughters and grand-dauthers until they are erased. For this reason the DNA methylation can have enduring effects and it's not neccesary to kill all cells to remove carcinogenesis. However not all periods of development allow to the use of these treatments. The sensitive ones are periods where DNA is opened and exposed; and in wich the epigenetic marks are erased to restore totipotency. Two of those periods are when the primordial germ cell<br />development occurs and in the pre-implantation period early development. Because of these sensitive periods, in young patients the use of the mentioned drugs must be study carefully given the fact that not only the cancer cell will be altered, but also germ cells could them be.</p></div>
