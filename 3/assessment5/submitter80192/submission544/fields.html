    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer is essentially the opposite of normal cells. In normal cells the CpG islands upstream of a tumour suppresor gene is not methylated allowing the genes to be expressed and thus prevent tumour formation. Cancer cells on the other hand suppress the tumour supressor genes by methylating the CpG islands allowing tumourigenesis. The methylation also seems to increase with more advanced cancer and can be measure to gauge metastatic state of disease.</p>
<p>In normal cells Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated keeping the cells stable and imprinting working normally. In cancer cells the Intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability and loss of imprinting. As an example loss of imprinting of IGF2 increases risk of colorectal cancer and is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Transposable elements that are normally silenced in a cell by methylation become active in a cancer cell due to hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>In some cases hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters leads to activation of Onco genes like R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p>
<p>In conclusion common elements of a cancer or precancancerous cells are genome wide hypomethylation that leads to loss of imprinting, chromosome instability and possibly onco gene activation in addition to hypermethylation of CGIs that suppress tumour suppressing genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated and flows over to H19 which is also methylated. The methylation of the ICR prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding to it. With no CTCF bound to the ICR the enhancers are able to act on the IGF2 and IGF2 is expressed by only the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated allowing the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR. CTCF insulates IGF2 gene and the enhancers act on H19 to produce a long non-coding RNA. Thus the maternal allele does not express IGF2 but H19 instead.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele also becomes methylated (hypermethylation) and behaves just as the paternal allele described above. This results in overexpression of the IGF2. Overexpression of IGF2 which is a growth promoting gene can result in disease state potentially resulting in conditions like Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting can be due to hyper or hypo methylation at ICR and both result in disease states due to overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of growth restricting genes. Disruption of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 cluster can result in over expression of IGF2 and is associated with Wilm's tumour and Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents.It is used in treatment of  myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine prevents or reduces DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Hypomethylation would allow tumour suppressor genes that otherwise might have been suppressed by hypermethylation in cancer cells to express and kill or control cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to DNA methylation is passed on mitotically. In other words any alterations to methylation of a cancer cells, which are usually actively dividing, are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells thus having an enduring effect. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times during an organism's development when there is active reprogramming of the epigenome. These are times when there is active removal or laying down of the epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development when there is active reprogramming of the epigenome are during germ cell development - from primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm and early embryonic development -  pre implantation and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Change in environment during these senitive periods would disrupt epigenetic reprogramming resulting in imprinting disorders and possible disease states. Also epigenetic treatments during early development or germ cell development could result in alterations in subsequent generations (sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters).</p></div>
