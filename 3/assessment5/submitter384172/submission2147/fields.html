    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Cytosine, one of the base pair is methylated and thus pairs with guanine forming CpG islands. CpG island are mostly found in promoters of genes and are protected from methylation as like in tumour supressor cells. Methylation at CpG islands induces silencing of gene expression by condensing the chromatin and therefore inactive X chromosome shows DNA methylation in CpG isalnds. </li>
<li> In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated and repetative elements are  hypermethylated so that it can carry out gene expression while in cancer cells it is vice-versa.  </li>
<li>DNA methyl transferase (DNMT1) is responsible for genomic stability and does not allow transcriptional interference to take place. Methylation also silences splice sites if more such sites are present.  It also silences the repeats to prevent transposition and recombination. Diseases like cancer are because of genomic instability.</li>
<li> In cancer, increased methylation of CpG islands is seen there by silencing tumor supressor genes while repetative elements, introns and intergenic regions are hypomethylated thereby causing the gene to express more in an unordered manner.</li>
<li> Intrestingly, cancer cells silences the tumour supressor genes which is achieved by CpG methylation. Eg: RB, MLH1, BRCA1, etc. Recently, it has been recently discovered that regions 2kb upstream and downstream of CpG island are also methylated in cancer cells.</li>
<li> In cancer cells loss of imprinting (hyper and hypo methylation) is also observed meaning both the parental alleles are expressed or silent as lots of genes involved in imprinting are involved in growth.  Eg: Igf2 expression in Wilms tumour, etc. It was also found that micro RNA (miR21) targets PTEN and thus lowers the expression of it causing gastric cancer and this happens due to hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters. Overall methylation plays a very vital role in the formation of cancer. </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele because enhancers acts on H19 due to the action of CTCF promoter.</li>
<li>It is unmethylated in the maternal allele as the CTCF promoter is methylated and the enhancers thus enhances Igf2 rather than H19. Due to this maternal allele is expressed which causes genomic imprinting. </li>
<li>In case of Wilms tumor, both the maternal and paternal allele expressing CTCF are overexpressed as CTCF promoter is methylated, making underlying gene silent. Thus hypermethylation of ICR leads to Igf2 over-expression forming Wilms tumour which is a type of childhood kidney tumor. It is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</li>
<li>Imprint control regions (ICR) are disrupted due to hypermethylation which results in the loss or over expression of growth promoting genes. Eg: H19/Igf2 cluster which is either over expressed or under expressed from both the parents. Interestingly most of the genes involved in imprinting are growth related genes. Thus imprinting disruption at H19/Igf2 cluster can cause severe diseases as they inhibit or overexpress growth promoting genes which are essential in developing embryo.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a class of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors and is FDA approved. It is currently being used for myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). </li>
<li>It is a replication dependent nucleoside analogue and binds DNA methyl transferases (DNMT) after they are incorprated into DNA. Thus the epigenetic marks which are removed by DNMT’s can no longer removed and thereby the gene expression will be silent. This happens because the chromatin remains in closed state leading to silent expression of gene. </li>
<li>Cancer cells as they are dividing more will be more severely affected. At lower doses they cause DNA methylation and thus supress the tumour formation showing anti-tumour effect. Other mechanism of action might be hypermethylation of CpG islands and their side effects are also less.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is responsible for the epigenetic marks which regulates gene expression in both ways. Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome and may be detrimental for the developing embryo. If methylation is overexpressed it silences the genes they surround including the tumour supressor genes which are responsible for stopping the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Another example is X-inactivation where the epigenetic marks stay throughout the life time of an individual to maintain the dosage compensation. </li>
<li>Sensitive period is period which is vulnerable to environment and can last forever due to resetting of epigenetic marks.</li>
<li> Sensitive period is referred to two periods from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature ovum and sperms is one sensitive period while second sensitive period is pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. In these periods resetting of epigenetic marks takes place known as active remodelling. </li>
<li>These periods are vulnerable to any drugs as the fate of the embryo depends on these sensitive periods as these are environment dependent. Treating patients during these periods may result side effects that may last beyond the drug period or even for life-time.</li>
