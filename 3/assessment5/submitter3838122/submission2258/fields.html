    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When DNA methylation is on CpG islands she will silence gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer DNA methylation can be hypermethylated (over expressed), and then result in for example, silencing of tumor supressor genes which can stop cancer from appearing. Can also resoult in loss of imprinting and then bouth genes (paternal and mathernal) are expressed and can cause disease.</p>
<p>Also can be  hypomethylated (under expessed), and result in:</p>
<p>a) genomic instability (because, repeatitiv or intergenetic reagions more often moves and cause disruptions in genome which can cause disease)</p>
<p>and b) oncogene activation which provides cancer cell to divide more often and to be immortal because of that. </p>
<p>Methylation in repetitive elements and intergenetic reagions ocourse to silence that genes and prevent them to move. In that way genome is more stable. Because of insertions of repetitiv elements some proteins can be deleted, changed there functions and this cought leed to cancer. In cancer methylatin on this genes are removed and genes are no longer silenced, can move through genome.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mathernal alele CTCF appears on genom and H19 are transcibed, H19 then leads to transcription of Enhancers which prevent Igf2 trannscription.</p>
<p>In paternal allele region in which CTCF would stand are methylated and this prevent CTCF to be there. Then H19 and enhancers are not transcribed and this resolt in Igf2 transcription and expresion. </p>
<p>In Willms tumor bouth aleles are methylated and we have overexpresed Igf2.</p></div>
