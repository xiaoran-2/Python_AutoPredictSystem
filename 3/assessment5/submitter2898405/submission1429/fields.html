    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation usually occurs at cytosine. Cytosine is found in CpG islands, which can be clustered or spread through the genome. Methylation at DNA level corresponds with gene silencing. Gene promoters are usually unmethylated, but if there is necessity they of course can be. On the other hand intergenic regions in most cases are methylated as well as repetitive elements what ensure genomic integrity. DNA methylation is a key process in important genome-wide regulation processes like imprinting, heterochromatin formation and inactivation of X chromosome.</p>
<p>Cancer is associated with vital changes in above described rules. Depending on stage, prognosis and type of cancer, different aberration may show off. First is hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG islands shores of tumor suppressor genes. This phenomena also may lead to loss of imprinting when occure in imprint control regions (ICRs). Second is hypomethylation in repetitive regions, CpG poor promoters and as well ICRs deregulation. Both result in genome-wide instability and over/under expression of key maintenance genes.</p>
<p>Mentioned above disruption of DNA methylation can lead to genomic instability, mutations, deregulation of growth factors expression– with the result of uncontrolled number of cell divisions. Also may contribute to suppression of apoptosis and take part in changing cell characteristics enabling metastasis and invasion. Such deregulation may contribute to angiogenesis in tumor spot, immune system escaping and tumor-inducing inflammation.</p>
<p>Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Repetitive elements’ silencing main function is to prevent transposition. Also as the methylation at cytosine is mutagenic it may result in transition of cytosine to thymine and prevent transposition. Silencing of transpozons is important to prevent illegitimate recombination and interference from strong transpozons' promoters.</p>
<p>In cancer methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is removed. It results with  genomic instability in particular: interference from strong promoters, illegitimate recombination, transposition. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions result in splicing aberrations and errors in transcription. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal conditions Igf2/H19 locus undergo imprinted regulation. At the paternal allele Igf2 is followed by methylated ICR region (methylation spread into H19). It allows enhancers to bind into Igf2 and allow expression. In case of maternal chromosome there is opposite situation. The ICR region is unmethylated what results in CTCF – insulator protein binding. This protein insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers, so H19 can be expressed thanks to binding to them (Igf2 is inhibited). So what we see is expression of igf2 from paternal and H19 from maternal chromosome.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, hypermethylation in ICR of maternal chromosome occurs, what results in CTCF binding inhibition. Without insulator protein, methylation spreads to H19 promoter what leads to lack of H19 expression. However, now enhancers have access to Igf2 promoter what results in over expression (from both chromosomes).</p>
<p>As Igf2 is growth promoting factor in absence of growth inhibitor (H19) the cells start to divide excessively what leads to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a drug from DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. It cause demethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Dacogen incorporate into DNA strand blocking laying down methylation in new cells, so its effect is seen in fast dividing cells. Decitabine can have anitumor effect as it erase epigenetic patterns and probably increase susceptibility to chemotherapeutics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs which are able to alter DNA methylation can have effects even when the treatment is terminated. The reason, is that epigenetic marks (DNA methylation) is maintained and passed to doughter cells. If it is removed, such state is also kept. Methylation has to be actively erased or established.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods of development particular, important epigenetic marks are established. They are crucial for future health, development and reproduction. The two main sensitive periods are: early development, after fertilization and PGC and GC development when epigenetic marks specific for sex are laid down. Treating patients with epigenetic disrupting drugs in sensitive periods can lead to fetal in effects changes. If the embryo would be exposed to such drugs it may cause irreversible developmental disorders and death. Interfering with germ cells development may end with infertility, developmental disorders in offspring and cancer. </p></div>
