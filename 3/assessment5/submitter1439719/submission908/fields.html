    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation involves methylation of 5’ group of cytosines within CpG dinucleotides. CpGs are commonly present in promoter regions of genes as clusters called CpG islands. These promoters have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation in cancer include either a genome-wide loss of methylation (i.e., hypomethylation observed in Repetitive regions and CpG poor promoters, leading to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes) or a regional gain of DNA methylation (i.e., hypermethylation leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes which are normally involved in controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair).</p>
<p>Locus specific DNA hypermethylation is observed in CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes. </p>
<p>Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype). CIMP has been described for colorectal cancer, gliomas, neuroblastoma and is associated with diverse clinicopathological characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability and genetic mutation. </p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Methylation of CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands has also been observed in cancer. It results in altered</span><span> gene expression and has been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells and help maintain genomic integrity and stability by silencing cryptic transcription sites and preventing abnormal deletions, illegitimate recombinations or insertions of genes. In cancer cells, a genome-wide lack of methylation causes genomic instability by illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Driven by chromosomal instability, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis. Effect of DNA methylation depletion can be stage specific i.e. early vs late in tumorigenesis. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The </span><em>H19/Igf2</em><span> locus utilizes a CTCF-dependent insulator located between two genes, Igf2 and H19 to mediate genomic imprinting. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</span></span></p>
<p>On the maternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) remains unmethylated allowing CTCF and its cofactors (cohesins and p68/SRA) to bind at 4 binding sites within the ICR. This interaction insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and allows downstream enhancers to access the <em>H19</em> promoter. Thus the Igf2 gene is repressed and H19 gene is expressed. </p>
<p><span><span><span>Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the </span><em>H19</em><span> promoter allows the enhancers to access </span><em>Igf2</em><span>. This the Igf2 gene is expressed and H19 gene is silenced because of methylation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>In cancer, there is loss of imprinting because of hypermethylation of both the maternal and paternal alleles at the Imprint control regions. In Wilms tumor, hypermethylation of ICR is observed for both the parental alleles leading to double dose or overexpression of the growth promoting Igf2 gene. Wilms tumor is a childhood kidney tumor. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent belonging to the class DNMT inhibitors (i.e., DNA methyltransferase inhibtors). It is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It gets incorporated into the DNA and then it </span></span>irreversibly binds DNMTs which can no longer be released. So its action is division dependent. So cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly in the body will be more severely affected by the use of this drug. This drug has anti-cancer effect at specific low doses at which they cause DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>This drug is well-tolerated in elderly patients (in their seventies) who have myelodysplastic syndromes and who had not responded well to other treatments.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to DNA methylation are <span>epigenetic changes that are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Thus, these changes are heritable and can last beyond the period of drug treatment. </span></p>
<p><span>Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).</span></p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods when reprogramming of epigenetic marks or active re-modelling of the epigenome occurs. During active re-programming, there is removal of existing marks and laying down of new marks at different parts in the genome but in general in the genome as a whole. In these periods, the changes are most sensitive to the changes in the environment.  One such period is the period of primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature sperms and eggs. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and early post-implantation period.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as it could affect the normal re-progamming and disrupt the normal development of individuals.</p>
