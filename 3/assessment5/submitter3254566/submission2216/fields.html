    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As compared with normal cells, the malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns.</span><span> Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation involves CpG islands. <span>Many tumors show some kind of hypermethylation of one or more genes (h<span>ypermethylation results in loss of expression of a variety of genes).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The covalent addition of a methyl group occurs generally in cytosine within CpG dinucleotides which are concentrated in large clusters called CpG islands. DNA methyltransferases are responsible for establishing and maintenance of methylation pattern. It is commonly known that inactivation of certain tumor-suppressor genes occurs as a consequence of hypermethylation within the promoter regions and a numerous studies have demonstrated a broad range of genes silenced by DNA methylation in different cancer types.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Hypomethylation is the second kind of methylation defect that is observed in a wide variety of cancers. G<span>lobal hypomethylation, inducing genomic instability, also contributes to cell transformation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Increased activity of the Igf2 </span><span>gene has been associated with many types of cancer. Normally, the Igf2 </span><span>gene undergoes genomic imprinting and only the copy inherited from a person's father is active. In some cancers, however, both the paternal and the maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce. This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Loss of imprinting of the Igf2 </span><span>gene has been identified in several types of cancer known as embryonal tumors. These tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Although these tumors commonly occur in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, loss of imprinting of the Igf2 </span><span>gene has also been seen in people with these tumors who do not have Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>

        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog. It is a hypomethylating agent that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.It is <span>thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death.</span></p>
