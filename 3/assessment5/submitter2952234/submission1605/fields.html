    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands which are found in or near promoter regions of genes, assures <strong>silencing</strong> of those genes (like in female X-inactivation).</p>
<p>Locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of <strong>tumour suppressor genes</strong> can silence those genes which are then unable to control cancer development since tumour suppressor genes control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair (i.e. RB in retinoblastoma). This could be one of the hits in the <strong>Knudson hypothesis</strong> of cancer development.</p>
<p>In the same way, hypermethylation of CpG islands can silence genes that produce normal proteins. Alteration or lack of those necessary proteins may contribute to a wide variety of diseases depending on the gene affected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintain <strong>genomic stability</strong>. <strong>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions</strong> can lead to chromosomal deletions, duplications, insertions and reciprocal translocation. It can also silence cryptic transcription or cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>Methylation of repeats also maintain genomic stability. <strong>Hypomethylation of repeats</strong> lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of neighboring genes through the activation of cryptic promoters.</p>
<p>This way DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions or repeats can  result in a variety of abnormalities and diseases (i.e. mutations in DNMT3b result in ICF syndrome)</p>
<p>Genomic instability occurs to some degree in all tumour types studied, appears early and progresses with tumorigenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) by hypo or hypermethylation can drive to the loss of expression of <strong>growth restricting genes</strong> or the overexpression of <strong>growth promoting genes</strong>, which is a common, early event seen in pre-neoplastic tissues.</p>
<p>The ICR of the <strong>paternal</strong> allele of the H19/Igf2 gene is methylated in normal cells. This allows the downstream enhancers to act directly on Igf2, which is expressed, while the ICR methylation spreads and methylate the H19 which is silenced.</p>
<p>In the normal <strong>maternal</strong> allele, the unmethylated ICR allows binding of the CTCF insulator, the enhancer cannot reach Igf2 (which is not expressed) but are then free to act on H19, which is expressed.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster may causes the maternal ICR to be methylated (like the normal paternal allele), this results in a production of <strong>double dose of Igf2</strong>, causing <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong>.</p>
<p>Since H19/Igf2 is a growth promoter, disrupted imprinting of this cluster may result in overexpression causing <strong>fetal and post-natal overgrowth</strong>, <strong>macroglossia</strong> and predisposition to <strong>embryonic and childhood cancer</strong> (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>DNA-demethylating agent</strong>. Decitabine, <strong>inhibits DNA methyltransferase</strong> activity upon incorporation into DNA, resulting in loss of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Combining Decitabine with histone-deacetylase inhibitors can have  an <strong>anti-tumour effect</strong> by slowing-down tumor growth for a long period, making cancer cells more susceptible to a routine chemotherapy applied immediately after epigenetic therapy.</p>
<p>(Juergens RA, Baylin SB. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22586682">Combination epigenetic therapy has efficacy in patients with refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</a> Cancer Discov. 2011 Dec;1(7):598-607)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>, thus alteration of the DNA methylation by epigenetic drugs may be transmitted to the daughter cells.</p>
<p>However, there are some sensitive periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. That is when epigenetic marks are erased and re-established.</p>
<p>Those sensitive periods are <strong>early embryonic development</strong> and <strong>germ cells production</strong>.</p>
<p>During early embryonic development epigenetic drugs given to the mother can interfere epigenetic reprogramming at the embryo which can result in potentially lethal alterations.</p>
<p>During germ cells production, epigenetic drugs are also to be avoided given that epigenetic reprogramming during this period could be affected and the alterations passed onto the off-spring. </p></div>
