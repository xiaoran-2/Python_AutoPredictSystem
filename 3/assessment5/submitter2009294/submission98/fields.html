    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns can occur in different genomic regions such as CpG islands (CGIs), CpG island shores, gene body and repetitive elements. Noteworthy, alterations in methylation patterns in any of these sites can produce the development of diseases such as cancer. Methylation patterns occur mostly on CGIs and this mechanism has been widely study. CGIs are located near to gene promoters, thus DNA methylation function as a controller of gene expression. These CGIs are non-methylated to promote gene expression in normal cells. In contrast, CGIs are hypermethylated in cancer and are tumor-type specific, hence hypermethylation silences some genes important for controlling tumor growth such as the tumor suppressor genes. However, hypomethylation at some promoters has been found in cancer and it can alter the expression of some oncogenes and the imprinting of some loci that are important for cancer development. As was mentioned, methylation patterns have also been found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, these regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated to avoid genome instability, spurious transcription, traslocations and gene disruption. However, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer. Even more, a global loss of methylation (genome-wide hypomethylation) is found in cancer cells. All the alterations mentioned before cause genomic instability, activation of endoparasitic sequences, initiation of transcription at wrong sites, and alterations in the expression of tissue-specific genes which are important in apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle control. It is important to mention that all these alterations in DNA methylation patterns may be due to defects in DNMTs recruitment or defects in DNMT expression.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation by some drugs such as 5-aza or Decitabine have enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic patterns are transmitted to daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, cancer cells treated with demethylated drugs will maintain the hypomethylation pattern through many cell divisions, thus patients that undergo chemotherapy after demethylated treatment will still have DNA hypomethylation in their cells which make them more susceptible to chemotherapy agents. Clinically, demethylated drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods during development where any alteration in the environment may have an effect on epigenetic control, thus changing the epigenome or epigenetic pattern of the offspring. During development there are sensitive periods which determine a specific phenotype: in early embryonic preimplantation and during primordial germ cell development. For this reason, the usage of these drugs should be avoided during pregnancy because it will cause alteration in the imprinting or in the expression of some genes which have a key role in tissue differentiation or in embryogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many paternal and maternal alleles of imprinted genes are distinguished because of the differences in the DNA methylation pattern. Igf2 is an imprinted gene which is paternally-expressed; instead H19 is maternally-expressed. Transcription of both genes is regulated by CTCF which is located between both genes. Therefore, on paternal allele, methylation of H19 promoter prevents the binding of CTCF to DNA, thus silencing H19 and allowing Igf2 to bind to the enhancers. On the other hand, CTCF binds to DNA on maternal allele because the promoter is not methylated and prevents Igf2 to bind to enhancer, thus inhibiting its expression and promoting the expression of H19 which functions as a tumor suppressor. In Wilm’s tumor, there has been shown a loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster. The loss of imprinting in this cluster produces methylation on both H19 alleles which results in overexpression of Igf2 (paternally and maternally) and in the reactivation of silent genes in the maternal alleles that are not expressed normally. Taking into account that H19 acts as a tumor suppressor, its inhibition will cause the tumor formation thanks to the upregulation of the growth factor Igf2.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It functions by its incorporation to one strand of DNA with the subsequent inhibition of the DNA methyltrasferase. As a result of this inhibition, DNA will be hypomethylated. Due to Decitabine effects, it is used to treat some myelodisplasic disorders such as leukaemia. Its antineoplasic effects rely on the expression of genes that are important for the control of cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, the expression of these genes counterbalances the overexpression of neoplasic genes which are important for the growth of cancer cells.</p></div>
