    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in many aspects.  In normal cells, CpG islands are typically hypomethylated (i.e., predominantly unmethylated).  However, in cancer cells, CpG islands are often hypermethylated (i.e., predominantly methylated).  The DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to disease by the silencing of tumour suppressor genes in cancer.  In normal cells, DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  However, in cancer cells, DNA is hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease by causing genomic instability in cancer.  Genomic instability includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.  This instability can produce chromosomal deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster experiences DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) as well as at the H19 promoter.  The DNA methylation causes silencing of H19 and blocks binding of CTCF, which allows the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 in the paternal allele.  In normal cells, the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated.  Thus, H19 is expressed and CTCF binds to the DNA, which prevents the downstream enhancers from activating Igf2.  Hence, Igf2 is silenced in the maternal allele for normal cells.  In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 ICR is hypermethylated (i.e., the methylation pattern is similar to the paternal allele).  Because of this imprinting disruption, Igf2 is expressed in both alleles in Wilm’s tumour.  The overexpression of the growth promoting gene Igf2 contributes to disease in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors or DNA-demethylating agents.  Decitabine enhances DNA demethylation (i.e., removal of DNA methylation).  Removal of DNA methylation at CpG islands by Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect (e.g., in myelodysplastic syndromes) by re-activating tumour suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As stated in the Economist article, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because “epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.”  In other words, alteration of DNA methylation would be preserved long after the drug treatment has ended because of the mitotic heritability of DNA methylation.  An epigenetically sensitive period is a period in which active reprogramming of epigenetic marks occurs.  The sensitive periods are during early embryonic (pre-implantation) development and during primordial germ cell development.  In addition, the female germ cells (oocytes) are in a demethylated state until puberty and, hence, can undergo epigenetic modifications from the environment.  It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods since the treatment could interfere with global epigenetic reprogramming and could possibly result in epigenetic abnormalities such as imprinting defects.  In addition, the effects of epigenetic drugs on the germ cells of younger patients need to be considered.</p></div>
