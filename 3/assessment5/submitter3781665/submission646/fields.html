    <div class="field-value"><p>   The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG Islands is to silence gene expression.CpG’s are clustered at gene promoters and are generally hypomethylated. These islands are usually protected from methylation. Methylated Cgis lead to silencing of gene expression, which is mitotically inheritable due to DNMTs and is a critical component of X inactivation.  </p>
<p>    In cancer, global methylation decreases from normal to metastatic tissue, but methylation of CpG Islands and shores becomes more likely and denser. This hypermethylation causes tumor suppressor promoter genes to be silenced causing a Knudson Hypothesis “hit” to the DNA resulting in cancer.  Since the hypermethylation is mitotically inheritable, it can be rapidly selected for as it gives the cells a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>    CgI hypermethylation is a favored biomarker in cancer diagnoses because normal hypomethylation is easily detected. Labs can do panels of biomarkers in sets of genes, giving a broader overview of the disease. These can determine tumor malignancy, type, and subtype based on methylation profile. The type is important in prognosis since CIMP is favorable but high methylation is not since it increases over time. In metastasis, point-of-origin specification allows for proper treatment. Chemotherapy can be determined also, e.g. MGMT hypermethylation means that the patient cannot process temozolomide. Tumor or DNA-free cells can be tested in bloodwork to determine if the tumor load is increasing or if cancer is recurring.  </p>
<p>   Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated and heterochromatized to keep them silent and maintain genomic stability. In cancer REs are hypomethylated early in tumorigenesis and have more open chromatin resulting in insertions, deletions, transpostitions and reciprocal translocations. Genomic instability causes abnormal karyotypes and transcriptional aberrations. Less commonly, hypomethylation in IRs causes activation of genes that silence tumor suppressors resulting in cancer.</p>
<p>  Epigenetic DNA methylation therapies are context dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions. It results in monoallelic parent of origin gene expression. The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated so the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to it. This allows the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, promoting expression. The lncRNA H19 is silenced by the spreading of methylation from the ICR.</p>
<p>     The maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers thereby silencing expression. The enhancers are freed to act on the H19 promoter to allow H19 expression.</p>
<p>                In cancer cells, a common feature is the loss of imprinting. Genes no longer show parent of origin monoallelic expression. Genes are either expressed in both maternal and paternal alleles or silenced in both. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth so they are important to cancer development. In the H19/Igf2 cluster in cancer the maternal ICR is hypermethylated, CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 isn't silenced. Igf2 is expressed on both alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting and over expression is shown early in neoplastic tissue causing Wilm’s tumor, a specifically childhood kidney tumor associated with Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is approved for treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome, which progesses to acute myelogenous leukemia. DNMT inhibitors prevent daughter strands from inheriting methylation so they are replication dependent. Cancer cells replicate very quickly and Decitabine, which is a nucleoside analogue, irreversibly binds to DNMTs and becomes incorporated into the DNA, disallowing the release of DNMT to the daughter strands. The drug is non-specific to cancer cells and could affect replication elsewhere, but it seems to be well tolerated in AML patients and greatly improves their prognosis. At low doses DNMTi’s have an anti-neoplastic effect. Decitabine is most effective on haematological malignancies, perhaps because Myelodysplastic Syndrome is dependent on high CpG Island hypermethylation. Its anti-tumor effect is not yet proven but can work by the same mechanism and with HDACi’s, as well as enhancing the effect of traditional chemotherapies on tumors.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. Assisted by DNMT’s, DNA methylation is copied onto the daughter strands during replication. Demethylation could continue on healthy cells after the tumor is eradicated. This could cause expression of genes that were meant to be silenced by methylation. It would be especially inadvisable to treat patients during epigenetically sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming by DNA demethylation to clear methylation marks which are then later reset by methylation.</p>
<p>   The first sensitive period is during preimplantation of the zygote and early development to the blastocyst stage. The methylation marks of the sperm and egg need to be reset for the zygote since each of these cells have necessary, specific functions for fertilization. Methylation marks are re-established in a cell type specific manner. The second sensitive period occurs during primordial germ cell development from the mid-gestation embryo through to oogenesis and spermatogenesis.  </p>
<p>  Using drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods could cause dysfunction in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes. It could also cause aberrations in egg and sperm development resulting in infertility for the patient.</p></div>
