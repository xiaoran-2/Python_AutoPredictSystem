    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in 60% of promoters of genes and they have a high density of CpG nucleotides. Normally, they are non-methylated irrespective of the gene being expressed or silenced. However, in cancerous cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated which results in silencing of the associated gene, thereby resulting in diseased states due to genomic instability. These hypermethylation sites are specific to the tumor types and subtypes, which has led to the concept of use of biomarkers to identify the cancer. In addition to the CpG islands, the 2kb neighboring island shores are also hypermethylated in cancer.</p>
<p>The intragenic regions and repetitive are normally methylated to maintain genomic stability by repressing the transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibition of antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing due to the gene silencing effects of methylation. In cancer, although less common than CpG island hypermethylation, these regions become hypomethylated, thus, causing genomic instability. This can be because of illegitimate recombination between the repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, or activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes in cancer cells show loss of imprinting. The genes that should be displaying monoallelic pairing of origin specific expression, i.e. are imprinted, no longer show this imprinted expression in cancer. They become either expressed from both parental alleles or become silenced from both the parental alleles. This is because a lot of genes that are imprinted are involved with growth either as a growth promoter or growth suppressor.</p>
<p>In the Igf2 cluster, normally the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, and non-methylated on maternal allele. In maternal allele, the CTCF binds to the insulator elements of the Igf2, and thus the enhancers act on H19 and the Igf2 is silenced. In the paternal allele, because of the methylation, CTCF is not insulating the Igf2 and thus, the enhancers act on the Igf2 leading to expression of Igf2. However, with loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation of the ICF on the maternal allele also leading to enhancers acting on non-insulated Igf2, thereby resulting in a double dose of Igf2, one from paternal and one of maternal allele. As Igf2 is associated with growth promoting, overexpression of Igf2 results in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a target enzymatic epigenetic regulator, i.e. drug that targets the active site of the enzyme. It belongs to the class of DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which progresses to acute myelogenous leukemia if untreated.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, i.e. it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication (thus, is replication dependent), and when DNA methyl transferases (DNMT) bind to them, it is irreversibly bound and can be no longer released. Thus, DNMTs are inhibited, resulting in DNA demethylation, especially at the CpG islands which are hypermethylated in these cancers. It results in its anti-tumor effect by activation of tumor-suppressor genes which were silenced because of the hypermethylation in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic characteristics of genomes are mitotically heritable. Thus, any drug having epigenetic effect, i.e. altering DNA methylation will have enduring effects of the epigenome. Additionally, current drugs don’t target a specific mutated form of gene, but it does effect the whole system affecting all the cells. These include the germ cells. During the period of germ cell formation is termed as the sensitive period in terms of epigenetics as this is the period when epigenetic marks are re-established. Thus, during these periods, these cells are highly sensitive to environmental insults. Drugs altering DNA methylation can be source of a major insult to the epigenetic marks, thus treating patients using such drugs during these sensitive periods would be highly inadvisable.</p></div>
