    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, DNA methylation at CpG islands functions in gene silencing. In general, most CpG islands of near promoters are unmethylated. However in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated resulting in silencing of tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer. In normal cells, methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements functions to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination. When these regions are hypomethylated, which occurs in cancer cells, genomic integrity is compromised that can lead to transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. Due to methylation of the ICR, the protein CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, thus allowing the enhancers that are located distal to the Igf2 gene to interact with its promoter. In addition, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter resulting in H19 gene silencing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated which allows binding of the CTCF protein. The bound CTCF acts as an insulator which prevents the downstream enhancers to interact with the Igf2 promoter. Instead, this results in the interaction of the H19 promoter and the enhancers to express the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting of the Igf2 gene occurs wherein the maternal allele acts like the paternal allele. This means that the Igf2 gene is also expressed in the maternal allele which results to overexpression of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodyspastic sydromes. It disrupts methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. A paper by Leone et al. (2002) have shown that a high prevalence of tumor-suppressor gene hypermethylation is present in <span>high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Aberrant hypermethylation present in the tumor suppressor gene, p15(INK4B) was associated with disease progression in MDS (Quesnel, et al., 1998). Thus, by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, tumor suppressor genes can be reactivated. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In The Economist article, it was stated that epigenetic alterations are mitotically inherited wherein these changes are passed on to daughter cells until they are actively erased. This provides an effective mechanism of treating cancer without having the need to kill all cells. However, treatment using drugs that would alter the epigenome should be avoided during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a period wherein the cell is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming, such as during primordial germ cell development and early development of the fetus. It is a crucial period because this is when epigenetic marks are laid down in the epigenome. When treating patients during sensitive periods, it is possible to pass down alterations in the epigenome via the germline that could gravely affect the growth of their offsprings. For example, treatment of an individual during a sensitive period with a DNA demethylating agent could result in hypomethylation of not only the patient's epigenome but also that of their future offsprings, which could possibly lead to loss of imprinting. </p></div>
