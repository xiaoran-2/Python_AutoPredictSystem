    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation takes place at the C<sub>5</sub> position of the cytosine base resulting in 5-methyl cytosine (5mC). Generally, DNA methylation of the promoter region of a gene is required for its silencing. It is also the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters, have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation.<sup>1</sup> In cancer, hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes which control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.<sup>1</sup> Disrupted DNA methylation at the CpG islands and its correlation to a disease can be exemplified by the hypermethylated CpG island at the promoter of LMNA gene and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).<sup>2</sup> Normally the DNA in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements remains in methylated state. This helps in the maintenance of genomic stability.<sup>2 </sup>Poor DNA methylation (Or DNA hypomethylation) in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. This may be in the form of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. All these abnormalities can lead to disease in general and cancer in particular if any tumor suppressor gene is lost or oncogene is activated.<sup>3</sup></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternally-expressed H19 and paternally-expressed Igf2 genes share enhancers and are reciprocally imprinted. On the maternal allele, the ICR remains unmethylated, allowing CTCF (Transcriptional repressor) to bind, mediating enhancer-blocking and preventing Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers. Hence, downstream enhancers access H19 promoter. Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter, allows the enhancers to access Igf2.<sup>1</sup> Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (Hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoter genes, thus contributing to disease.<sup>2</sup> In Wilm’s tumor, there is hypermethylation of ICR and loss of imprinting reversal of maternal to paternal epigenotype, with paternal pattern of methylation of H19 promoter, Igf2 turned on, and H19 turned off. These culminate in increased cell growth.<sup>2</sup></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class epigenetic inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme DNA-methyltransferase. DNA methyltransferase is a family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of methyl group to DNA.<sup>1</sup> By inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine precludes the DNA from undergoing unwarranted methylation. Thus, Decitabine demethylates or hypomethylates the DNA.<sup>2</sup> Aberrant DNA methylation patterns (e.g., hypermethylation – reflecting increased activity of DNA methyltransferase) have been associated with a number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of certain tumor suppressor genes causes their inactivation, contributing to tumorigenesis. Inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (Decitabine) thus can have an anti-tumor effect.<sup>3</sup></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations such as DNA hypermethylation or hypomethylation are passed on during cell division to subsequent generations until they actively erased. Epigenetic therapies (such as alteration of methylation pattern of DNA) can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Sensitive periods are defined as the major periods of epigenetic reprogramming of the genome or the periods of active remodeling of epigenome.<sup>1</sup> Two important sensitive periods of development in terms of epigenetic reprogramming are the period from the primordial germ cell development to the production of mature gametes (eggs or sperms) and the periods including pre-implantation and early post-implantation.<sup>2  </sup>Sensitive periods are characterized by the clearance of old epigenetic marks and active addition of new ones. Any treatment that addresses an epigenetic abnormality would be inadvisable during such critical periods, as there remains a chance of treatment being ineffective. Moreover, new abnormality may set in (as the side effects of the treatment) because altered environment can have a profound effect on epigenome during sensitive periods.</p>
