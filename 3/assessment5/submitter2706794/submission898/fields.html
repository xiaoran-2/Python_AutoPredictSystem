    <h1>Submission 898 from Anon (session_user_id: 2ce76565b7a6a957de04c46d36c3c9f9de8b88dc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation will have effects beyond the period of drug treatment because such epigenetic changes can be passed on during cell division to the daughter and even the granddaughter cells until these epigenetic marks are erased. This is the reason why the effects of the drugs can be felt even until the third generation (grandchild generation). In the case of tumour cells that are genetically-linked/inherited, a grandmother who was treated with epigenetic drugs that have the ability to suppress tumor growth, the effects of the drugs can be manifested even to the grandchild, indicating beneficial effects after the period of drug treatment. In human beings, there are sensitive periods during their development. During these periods, there is epigenetic reprogramming, which means that there is clearing of epigenetic marks. This takes place during in two stages: at the early embryonic development or at the preimplantation stage and at the primordial germ cell development. During these times there is demethylation of both paternal and maternal genomes, thus epigenetic marks are erased. Because of this, treating patients for some diseases link to epigenetics during their sensitive periods of development are not advisable because during this time epigenetic marks are erased, hence the effects of the drugs are not clearly observed in the offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, a kind of condition where some blood cells are dysfunctional. It is also used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. This drug is a cytidine analog. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Cancer cells usually have high rates of DNA methylation especially at CpG rich sites or at CpG island shores. As a hypomethylating drug, decitabine is incorporated in the DNA strand, and in the presence of this drug it inhibits de novo DNA methylation by the DNA methyltransferases. This drug has an anti-tumor effect because when there is DNA hypomethylation upstream or at the promoter sites, the activity of some tumor-suppressor genes that are located downstream are not silenced, thus they are able to keep the tumor cells in check or suppressed.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are found mostly in promoters of genes such that 60% of promoters contain CGIs. In a normal cell, CpG islands are usually free from methylation hence the promoters are able to direct the expression of the genes downstream. For example, non-methylated CGIs of promoters in tumor-suppressor genes ensure that these tumor-suppressor genes are active, thus, preventing the cells from developing tumors. In addition, CpG island shores that are located at approxitely 2 kb from these CpG islands are also hypermethylated and can also lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Once these CGIs as well as CpG island shores in promoters are hypermethylated, the tumor suppressor genes are silenced and such features are found in cancer. Methylation in CGI increases over time, thus, it can be inferred that cancer could be a consequence of ageing. Thus, hypermethylation of CGIs in promoters of tumor-suppressor genes lead to the silencing of these genes and such silencing could lead to the progression of cancer. On the other hand, in the normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, thus preventing disruption in gene function and maintaining genome stability. These repeats and intergenic elements are abundant in the genome of an individual. These repeats are hypermethylated and the chromatins are densely packed resulting in the stability of the genome. If these repeats are hypomethylated, these can lead to genome instability due to the tendency of unwanted recombination of repeats, activation or transposition of the repeats or even deletion/insertion of chromosomal parts as well as disruption of some neighbouring genes. In some animal models, hypomethylation in specific tissues is a result in deletion of the DNA methyltransferase or mutations of that gene. Hypomethylation in specific tissues does not lead to death of an organism but may lead to genome instability that could cause the formation of certain types of cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster are imprinted in humans and this cluster is involved in growth-promoting mechanism. In the paternal allele, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated and spreads to the promoter of H19 region, thus silencing its expression too. The enhancers downstream are not able to act on H19 cluster because it is methylated, thus the enhancers act on the Igf2 leading to its expression. On the other hand, in the maternal allele the ICR is non-methylated and thus binds to CTCF, an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from enhancers located downstream. Because of this, the enhancers bind to H19 and eventually is expressed. The Igf2 in the maternal allele is silenced because the enhancers do not bind with it to drive expression. If imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted it means that both the ICRS of the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated, then the enhancers bind to the Igf2 region of both paternal and maternal alleles, leading to expression. Since Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene it leads to the occurrence of Wilm's tumor, a kidney tumor in children. This tumor takes place early in development and manifested in pre-neoplastic cells. Therefore loss of imprinting in the Igf2/H19 cluster can contribute to formation of tumors during early development.</p></div>
