    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, in order to maintain genomic stability, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated-- however, the opposite is true in cancerous cells. There, CpG islands are hypermethylated. This disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease because CpG islands tend to be located near promoters of genes. When methylated, expression of said gene is prevented, which will cause problems if the affected gene is a tumour-suppressor. Also, this may interfere with the process of the inactivation/dense packaging of chromosomes into heterochromatin, which may cause issues with X-inactivation and imprinted genes in general.</p>
<p>Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements has also been compromised in the instance of cancer. Normally functioning cells tend to display hypermethylation in these regions, while cancerous cells show hypomethylation. When DNA methylation is at normal levels, it insures that the the retrotransposons (repetitive elements) remain put and maintain genomic integrity at the intergenic regions. When this balance is disturbed, as in is seen in the hypomethylation of cancer, nearby repetitive elements, or retrotransposons, are allowed to become active. When these parts are working, they jump around the genome, inserting themselves into various genes and potentially causing illegitimate recombinations. Because they contain two powerful promoters, they inevitably wreak havoc wherever they land. Worst of all, however, is when they end up near oncogenes. Also, lack of methylation at intergenic regions promotes genomic instability, increasing the frequency of gene deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations. This also serves to prevent transcriptional interference (which retrotransposons are also known to cause), in the event that two RNA-polymerases bump into one another while transcribing from promoters going in opposite directions (towards each other), downstream of a cryptic splice site.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At a healthy patient's H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele's imprint control region (ICR) near Igf2/H19 is hypomethylated. The insulator element CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, which insulates the Igf2 from the influence of enhancers-- thus, they work upon the H19 instead, increasing its expression. The opposite occurs in the paternal allele, as its ICR is hypermethylated. Here, because CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, the enchancers are able to work upon the Igf2. Thus, in the example of the paternal allele, H19 expression is lowered, while Igf2 expression is increased. In the occurence of Wilm' s tumor, both ICRs are hypermethylated, leading to twice the normal levels of Igf2 expression and little to no expression of H19. Thus, as Igf2 is a growth-promoting, this instance of disrupted imprinting results in the formation of a tumor in the kidneys of children, Wilm's tumor. Overall, loss of imprinting is an early sign of cancer, found almost across all types. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by a Japanese company named Eisai, is a type of DNA-demethylating agent. As its class's name implies, decitabine reduces the amount of DNA methylation present, which in turn will increase expression of many genes. While the potential side-effects of decreasing methylation genome-wide have not been fully discovered, hopefully, the expression of tumour-suppressing genes that are likely being surpressed by the growth of the cancer will be increased, thus eradicating the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we discovered earlier, epigenetic alternations are mitotically heritable, "passed on from cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased." Thus, even after treatment has ended, its effects may persist for some time.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is generally a moment in time in which the epigenetic marks on the genome of a cell are being reset. Two such primary examples would be after fertilization (early development) and during primordial germ cell development. Treating a patient with various drugs targeting the epigenome would be highly ill-advised during these periods, as the effects of these drugs, especially long-term ones, have not been particularly well explored. It would be very risky to treat patients during this time period, in which their sex cells (sperm/oocytes) may also be affected by the drug/treatment, and carry on the effects to their offspring.</p></div>
