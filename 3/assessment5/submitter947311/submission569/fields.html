    <h1>Submission 569 from Anon (session_user_id: b0eaa4602cdf4933938b08292268fc6abec60a36)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Treatment with Decitabine results in global DNA hypomethylation.  This effect is achieved by Decitabine's ability to inhibit DNA methyltransferases both in vitro and after it is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA strangds.  As cancer cells continue dividing rapidly under the presence of Decitabine, less DNA would be left methylated with each cell division (since it cann't be methyldated) thus supressing (or greatly reducing) this mitotically inheritable epigenetic change. </p>
<p>Decitabine is hypothesized to exert anti-tumour activity by reducing methylation of genes that are critical for maintaining cellular proliferation and differentiation, restoring their normal activity.  In addition, it is hypothesized that Decitabine can form covalent bonds with methyl transferases and thus promote cytotoxicity in cells which incorporate it in their DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells exhibit a differential methylation pattern associated with pathogenicity and clinical outcomes.  One of the hallmarks of abberant methylation is found in CpG islands, which are also found frequently in promoter regions.  Normally, CpG islands that are located in promoter regions are free of methylation, allowing for normal transcriptional processes to take place.  Regions where CpG islands are methylated in normal cells are freqnetly found in retroviral insertions and repeats (SNIES and LINES).  In these places, CpG methylation allows for suppression of the DNA element which otherwise would be harmful for normal cellular function.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated, especially those that are densely localized to promoter regions.  These abberant hypermthylation pattern is associated with distinct cancer types and clinical outcomes.  Driving these observations are the ability of higher CpG methylation to suppress transcription through their neighboring gene.  Some of the genes that are downregulated by their CpG island methylation are tumor supressor genes; when their expression is reduced the cell cycle becomes deregulated and promotes uncontrolled cell division.</p>
<p>Coming back to methylation at intergentic regions and repetitive elements, cancer cells exhibit a lower pattern of methylation in these regions.  Interestingly, when those regions are hypomethylated it has been showsn that 'jumping genes' and abberant long non coding RNA are more highly expressed which through not a completely known mechanism disrupt cellular proliferation, and cancer tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster exhibits genomic imprinting by having the paternal allele methylated several sites upstream of the H19 gene which is transcribed into a long non coding RNA.  When the paternal allele is methylated it prevents prevents transcription of H19 which normally supressed the expression of Insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2).  When H19 fails to be transcribed on the paternal allele, more IGF2 can be produced which promotes cellular proliferation.  However, the mathernal allele is not methylated and continuously produces H19 RNA which supresses in cis its own IGF2 copy.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the mathernal allele reveres to a paternal epigenotype and becomes methylated.  In these tumors, H19 expression is reduced and IGF2 expression is greatly elavated.  In patients suffering from this epigenetic imprinted reversal, higher levels of IGF2 observed in the kidneys devlop a large tumor which is life threatening.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It has been observed that DNA methylation is a stable genetic mark which can be mitotically heritable.  This phenomenon is mainly possible due to a recurring pattern of DNA methyltransferase activities and DNA demethylases which act in a heritable pattern.</p>
<p>Interestingly, during fertilization and gamete maturation global DNA methylation is reset and reestablished.  These periods in development when DNA methylation is altered are called sensitive periods because these are times when the pattern of DNA methylation is not mitotically heritable, and can be prone to intracellular and environmental changes.</p>
<p>Taking these observations into considerations, the findings by Dr. Baylin may suggest that the DNA methylation pattern which is altered by epigenetic drugs may be sustained through eventual mitosis even after the drug is no longer present.  These drus may be responsible for a re-establishment of a new methylation pattern which is maintained by the activity of altered DNA methylases and demethylases.  In note, these drugs may also alter the activity of these enzymes by affecting their associated gene through epigenetic manipulation.</p></div>
