    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands in normal cells are typically unmethylated (although X inactivation is accomplished by DNA methylation of all CpG islands on the X chromosome).  If CpGs are methylated, they can bind MeCP1 and MeCP2, which can recruit other factors necessary for chromatin condensation to form heterochromatin. .</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation is seen at CpG islands, which contain promoters for tumor suppressor genes.   The increased methylation of these islands and the surrounding shores can silence these genes.  This hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and thus is passed down to all newly created cells derived from the cell with this aberration, allowing the tissue to grow abnormally, ultimately becoming cancerous.  These epimutations are rapidly selected for because these abnormally growing cells have a competitive growth advantage.  The Knudsen Hypothesis states that cancer is the result of multiple damaging insults to the DNA because a single insult is often not enough to inactivate all of the tumor suppressor genes available to protect the cell from cancer.  In addition to hypermethylation (which is an epigenetic phenomena), genetic mutations can provide additional insults to allow for the progression to cancer.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in normal cells, where methylation plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by silencing genes that allow transposition.  It also silences cryptic promoters or splice sites.  </p>
<p>Hypomethylation in cancer is seen genome wide (with the exception of CpG islands and shores), and thus is common in repetitive elements and intergenic regions,  Lack of methylation in these areas leads to genomic instability because the chromatin is not in heterochromatin form. This allows the repetitive sequences to align and undergo illegitimate recombination.  In addition, hypo-methylated repeats are more likely to become activated, copy themselves, and then transpose to other locations in the genome resulting in deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations.  These physical changes in the DNA can result in disruption of genes affected or activation of neighboring genes. Cryptic promoters can become activated, resulting in aberrant transcription of surrounding genes.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome11 is not imprinted and thus the ICR  is not methylated in normal cells. This allows ICR binding to CTCF, which is an insulator protein that blocks downstream enhancers from promoting expression of the Igf2 gene (by preventing looping of the DNA).</p>
<p>The paternal allele is imprinted.  Thus it does have a methylated ICR and therefore cannot bind CTCF.  Thus the interaction of the enhancers with Igf2 is not blocked and Igf2 expression is enhanced. The methylation can spread from the ICR downstream so the H19 promoter is also methylated and thus is silenced.  Thus in cells with normal imprinting, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In imprinting disorders such as the Beckwith Weidemann Syndrome (due to mutations causing loss of imprinting, paternal UPD, or other epigenetic disruptions) the maternal allele ICR is hypermethylated and thus behaves like the paternal allele.  This results in loss of maternal allele expression of Cdkn1c, which is a tumor suppressor gene.   In addition Igf2, which is a growth promoting oncogene, is expressed from the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele and the individual receives a double dose of this gene which accelerates growth of cells.  These two changes can result in Wilm’s tumour (seen in childhood but not adults).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The article refers to Decitabine as a DNA-demethylating agent, but it is more accurate to describe it as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase (by irreversibly binding to the DNMT during DNA replication) which ultimately results in demethylation.  DNA methyltransferase  is an enzyme which adds a methyl group to cytosine in DNA to form 5-methyl cystosine, which in mammals occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides.  In cancerous cells, CpG islands, which usually contain promoters for cancer suppressing genes, are hypermethylated and thus silenced.  As a result tumor suppressor gene products are not made and the cell is unable to suppress the growth of the tumor.  If DNA methylation is inhibited (as with Decitabine) these tumor suppressor genes are no longer silenced and can make gene products which suppress the formation of tumors.  Thus the therapeutic effects of this drug on hematologic malignancies is  due to induction of hypomethylation and reactivation of critical tumor suppressor genes. There may be other mechanisms of action as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one mechanism for laying down epigenetic marks, which are mitotically heritable, during embryonic development and is the basis for imprinting and the formation of heterochromatin.   Thus drugs that alter DNA methylation, especially during times when these marks are being laid down, can have enduring effects on the epigenome.  The human genome is epigenetically re-programmed at specific times in the development of the individual.  In the blastocyst stage there is resetting of epigenetic marks in a cell specific manner which is  maintained in somatic cells.  In the mid-gestational embryo the primordial germ cells are epigenetically re-programmed.  Although these are the two primary times for epigenetic reprogramming, there may be other periods of reprogramming during organ development for specific types of cells.  Imprinted genes resist the first round of pre-implantation reprogramming but do get reprogrammed during promordial germ cell development.  These periods of reprogramming are considered sensitive periods because alterations in the reprogramming process (for example by administering drugs which alter DNA methylation) during these periods result in epigenetic abnormalities, including aberrant imprinting, in gametes and somatic cells.  An example of this is  the occurence of imprinting disorders (such as Beckwith Weidemann Syndrome and Angelman Syndrome) when epigenetic reprogramming is disruptied during the use of assisted reproductive technologies.  </p>
