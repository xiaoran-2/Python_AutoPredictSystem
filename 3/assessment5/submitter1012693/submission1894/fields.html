    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alters the expression of genes. CpG islands are present in the promoter regions of many genes. They tend to be unmethylated in normal cells. Methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression and is needed for X chromosome inactivation and cell differentiation during emryogenesis.</p>
<p>The epigenome of cancer cell is different from the epigenome of normal cell. The causes are genomic instability and silencing of tumor suppression genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. Epigenetic hallmarks of cancer include global DNA hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation at CpG islands. CpG methylation at promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes leads to their transcriptional silencing. DNA hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters results in the gene activation including oncogene activation.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated. Methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic stability and plays particular role in silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice site. In tumor cells repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also maintaining of the genome stability and include 1) prevention of transposition by silencing or mutation of the repeats; 2) avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters; 3) prevention of chromosome recombinations.</p>
<p>In cancer cells repetitive elements and intergenic regions are unmethylated and the genome is unstable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. lncRNA H19 is produced only from maternal allele. H19 is something like reservoir for miRNAs. Protein CTCF binds to unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele. CTCF is an insulator protein. It insulates lgf2 from enchancers located downstream. The enchancers act on H19 and enchance its expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele ICR is methylated and CTCF can't bind. There is no insulator action of CTCF and enchancers act on lgf2 and enchance its expression on the paternal allele. lgf2 is expressed only from paternal allele.</p>
<p>Activation of lgf2 on the maternal allele is found in approximately half patients with Wilm's tumor. It's suggested that biallelic expression of lgf2 is the key event of some Wilm's tumors. Increased expression of lgf2 is responsible for somatic overgrowth and predisposition to tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It incorporates into DNA during replication and RNA during transcription. Decitabine incorporation inhibits DNA methyltransferase. This results in DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>One of the features of cancer cells is hypermethylation at CpG islands which assosiated with gene silencing including tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are responsible for control of cell proliferation. When these genes are transcriptionally inactive there is cell overgrowth and the beginning of tumorogenesis. With help of Decitabine it's possible to make tumor suppression genes unmethylated and transcriptionally active and control cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drug that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome because DNA methilation is mitotically inheritable. If in cancer cell DNA became for example hypomethylated as a result of drug treatment all daughter cells will inherit this hypomethylated DNA.</p>
<p>There are periods during ontogenesis when using such drugs are inadvisable. These periods are sensitive periods. There are two main sensitive periods: pre-implantation period in early development and primordial germ cell development. During these periods epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are removed and then re-established. Drugs that can alter DNA methylation in cancer cells also can alter DNA methylation in normal cells.</p></div>
