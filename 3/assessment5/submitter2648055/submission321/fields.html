    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl"> </p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG island ( usually in promoter region) is silencing of genes. CpG island are usually unmethylate so genes are active . Sometimes there is a disruption in the methylation pattern this can be a result of : 1. Mutation in chromatin related enzymes such as DMMT's or chromatin remodelers which can cause global changes in epigenetic. 2. Faulty targeting or altered composition of epigenetic complexes 3.Changed in the spatio- temporal organization of the nuclear architecture or loss of boundaries might cause altered nuclear territories , disrupt ordered epigenetic patterns . These process can lead  to methylation of    CpG islands and this causes silencing of genes some of  them are tumor suppressors  and that and cause unregulated growth – cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">In intergenic regions and repetitive elements the CpGs are usually methylated . This is important for silencing repeats and preventing transposition of repeat elements and prevents illegitimate recombinations. These are all very important in order to keep genome stability. In cancer because of methylation disruption ( as explained above) which can be a result from altered external signaling due to permanent stress, intergenic region and repeats are hypomethylated and that causes genome instability activate cryptic splice site and causes cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is different than the maternal allele in the case of H19/Igf2 cluster. In this cluster there are some genes and element: the Igf2  gene the  the ICR  ( which can bind CTCF protein, H19  and 2 enhancer sequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and that avoids binding of CTCF and the enhancers  activates Igf2.The methylation of ICR spreads also to the H19 which is also silenced. So in the paternal allele Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl"> In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated CTCF can bind to the ICR    and     it works as insulator, it insulates the enhancers from the Igf2 gene and the enhancers works on H19 gene and not on Igf2. So  in the maternal allele Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">Mutations and deletions in the ICR  and other places in the cluster can alter imprinting. This can cause to CTCF not to bind to the IRC in the maternal allele which can cause to double expression of Igf2 ( from the maternal and paternal allele) and overgrowth- cancer. Cancer can be a result of over expression of Igf2 also because of uniparental disosomy that is chromosome 11 appears in two copies from the father . In both cases Igf2 is over expressed( since usually only one allele is expressed)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">Decitabine is a DNA demathylase agent so it inhibits DNA methylation.This drug is a nucleoside analogue it enters the DNA during replication and than binds DNMT irreversibly so it can not methylate the hemymethaylated DNA .  That’s how its inhibits DNA methylation. This can have anti tumor effect especially when the cause of cancer is hypermethylation. For example in myelodysplastic syndrome there is CpG island hypermethylation  which cause the disease because it silences tumor suppressors genes  so demethylation can reverse the hypermethylation bringing it to the normal situation and  re- expression of these tumor suppressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect since it changes the epigenetic pattern of the cells. The purpose of this treatment is not necessarily to kill the cancer cells but to change them and to erase their cancer characteristic. Since epigenetic changes are passed in during cell division it can effect changes which stop cancer from growing without having to kill the cells or it can just increase the cell sensitivity to other drugs.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">A sensitive period is the time when reprogramming of epigenetic marks is established in this periods there is active remodeling of epigenetic marks. The sensitive periods in development are embryogenesis ( preimplantation) and gametogenesise- primordial germ line.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;" dir="rtl">Treating patient during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since this period is sensitive to epigenetic changes. Since the drugs are not gene specific they can work on many epigenetics marks and cause altered patterns of methylation which can be harmfull.</p></div>
