    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA at Cytosines that are followed by Guanines (this is called CpG dinucleotide) by the enzyme DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). CpGs are often clustered into islands at promoters of genes. Methylation at CpG island causes silencing of gene expression due to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure by MeCP proteins and other factors. <span>DNA methylation suppresses the expression of "unwanted" genes.</span></li>
<li>Cancer involves hypomethylation at CpG island, what can lead to activation of inactivated oncogenes, and hypermethylation, that can lead to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. There is also a loss of imprinting as a result of disruption of methylation at CpGs.</li>
<li>Cancer is the rusult of multiple hits to DNA (Knudson hypothesis), DNA methylation at CpG islands is one of them. DNA methylation is more frequently than mutations, rapidly selected, mitotically heritable.</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity.</li>
<li>Cancer <span>is characterised</span><span> by </span>genom-wide hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements .</li>
<li>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to transpositions, transcriptional interference, illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and oncogenes promoters etc.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>H19/Igf2 cluster has an imprinted control region (ICR) that is methylathed on a paternal chromosome. Methylation of that region blocks binding of CTCF insulator protein, that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Methylation of ICR spreads to and silence H19 promoter, that is closer to enchancers. Paternal Igf2 is expressed.</li>
<li>ICR and H19 on the maternal chromosome are unmethylated. CTCF insulator protein can bind to ICR and block enhancers from accesing Igf2. Maternal H19 is activated.</li>
<li>Mat ----[<em>Igf2</em>]--<strong>xx</strong>--[ICR+CTCF]----[<strong>H19</strong>]---------&lt;&lt;&lt;{<strong>enhancers</strong>}<br />Pat  ----[<strong>Igf2</strong>]-------[<em>ICR-met</em>]-------[<em>H19-met</em>]---&lt;&lt;&lt;{<strong>enhancers</strong>}</li>
<li><span>In Wilm’s tumour ICRs on both chromosomes are methylated, what leads to overexpression of Igf2 and absence of H19 - loss of imprinting.</span></li>
<li><span>Double dose of Igf2 <span>contributes to disease.</span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).</li>
<li>Decitabine inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferase through incorporation into DNA and irreversible binding to DNMTs, as they (dnmts) trying to <span>copy the methylation to the daughter strand during cell replication</span>,<span> causing hypomethylation of DNA.</span></li>
<li><span>Decitabine shows good results in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and other cancer-types, that are associated with CpG island hypermethylation because of its hypomethylation effect.</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. There is also a complex interplay between Genetic and Epigenetic, epigenetic alterations can cause permanent genetic alterations.</li>
<li>Sensitive period - period <span>when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. </span></li>
<li><span>It's a period of primordial germ cell development <span>all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the pre-<span>implanted and early post implantation period - both are <span>periods of active remodelling of the <span>epigenome</span></span>.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span>Treating patients during </span>period of germ cell development can lead to epigenetic abnormalities in the progeny. Treatment in </span></span></span></span>early embryonic development can affect imprinting and X-inactivation.</li>
