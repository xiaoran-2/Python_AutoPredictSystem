    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypomethylated so that the genes (usually tumour suppressors) neighboring them are expressed. In cancer these islands and their shores are hypermethylated. This leads to silencing of neighboring genes (usually tumour suppressors) which in turn leads to abundant growth of affected cells hence causing cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated so that they are suppressed and silenced. This is needed for genomic stability as the deletions and insertions in chromosomes require matching sequences which are provided in plenty by the repetitive elements if they are hypomethylated. In cancer, these regions become hypomethylated and lead to genomic instability through DNA insertions and transpositions and disturbing the structure of the centromere and telomere as well. Hypomethylation leads to transcription of these regions as well, which might interfere with normal functioning of other genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele concerned with H19/Igf2 cluster has the promoter for H19 methylated. This disables the binding of CTCF on the promoter for H19 thereby silencing its expression. In turn this allows for the expression of the Igf2 gene which is situated upstream of the CTCF binding site.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele however, the H19 promoter is unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind and thereby express H19 from the locus downstream. This also implies that the Igf2 locus is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated. This means that the even the maternal allele now expresses the Igf2 protein and not the H19 protein just like the paternal allele. Consequentially the dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoting hormone, is doubled while the amount of H19 is reduced significantly. This leads to abundant growth and replicatoin in the tumour cells ad contributes to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMT inhibitors. This drug demthylates the DNA methylation marks by inhibiting the action of DNA methyl transferase enzymes which are employed to methylate the DNA. This drug would work for treating tumours which are caused by hypermethylation of the DNA. This hypermethylation would have led to silencing of some genes (probably growth suppressors) and led to tumour formation. By using the drug the amount of methylation can be decreased thereby leading to expression of the previously silenced genes and normal cell growth and death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks once established are mitotically heritable (assuming there are no disrupting factors). This would mean that methylation marks established through a drug will probably last the lifetime of the individual and is established during a sensitive period, it might last the lifetime of the progeny as well. Sensitive periods are defined as periods during the development of an individual from the zygote when epigenetic marks are erased and re-established. During development these happen to be in the embryo at the blastocyst stage and also in the adult during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would in inadvisable because this might interfere with the process of erasure and re-establishment of epigenetic marks and lead to a 'mutated' epigenome. An epigenome which does not have the right marks will lead to unnatural silencing and expression of genes thereby leading to disorders.</p></div>
