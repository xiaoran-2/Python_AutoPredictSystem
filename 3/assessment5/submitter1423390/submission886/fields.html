    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGs clustered into CpG islands often occurs at promoters of genes where the transcription machinery binds. And methylation of CpG islands are mostly associated with gene silecing. Therefore, in normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands are more likely to be methylated (CpG islands hypermethylation) which leads to silencing tumor suppressor genes which are responsable for make the cell dye and decrease the proliferation. And as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this is a very effecient way to "lock" these genes.</p>
<p>In normal cells, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in order to mantain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, illegitimate recombination, transcriptional interference and others.</p>
<p>In cancer those regions I just mencioned tend to be unmethylated (hypomethylation genome-wide). The way this disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease depends of the location where the hypomethylation occurs, but, generaly, it will cause genomic instability and when it occurs at CpG low promoters may lead to the activation of oncogenes which are responsable for stimulate growth.</p>
<p>So, summing up, in cancer we have less cells dying due to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes caused by the hypermethylation of CpG islands and simultaneously we have cells divinding more rapidly because of the activation of oncogenes caused by the hypomethylation of CpG low promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine induces hypomethylation by silencing DNA methyltransferases<span> </span>and therefore allows the expression of previously silenced genes such as tumor suppressor genes that induce the decrease of proliferation<span> in cancer cells.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is symmetrical and therefore mitotically heritable. When a cell divides and the DNA replicates it's formed a hemi-methylated DNA (new strand of DNA, not methylated plus a "old" strand of DNA, methylated). This hemi-methylated DNA is recognised by DNMT1 (a methyltransferase) that bounds to DNA and lays down a methylation on the daughter strand. And that's why drugs that can alter DNA methylation state have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>But there are some periods of development when this kind of treatment should be avoid: the sensitive periods.</p>
<p>The sensite periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming such as pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development. If patients were treated with those kind of drugs in sensitive periods the reprogramming could go wrong and cause abnomalities. </p>
<p>For example, if we used these kind of drugs during the primordial germ cell development it would result in abnormal germ cells and it may lead to infertility or perhaps problems in a future embryo.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells usually display loss of imprinting and this probably happens because the genes that are imprinted are associated with growth promotion or growth suppression. Therefore in cancer the imprint control regions tend to be hypermethylated or hypomethylated according to the function of the gene in question.</p>
<p>The example of the H19/lgf2 cluster it's a case of hypermethylation of the imprint control region.</p>
<p>In normal cells the imprint control region is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF binds its insulator element and therefore the enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele. In the other hand, when the imprint control region is methylated the enhancers are able to act on Igf2 due to the absense of CTFC binding and therefore the Igf2 is expressed om the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In cancer the imprint control region in both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated (hypermethylation leads to imprinting loss) and therefore Igf2 levels doubles in comparision with a normal cell.</p></div>
