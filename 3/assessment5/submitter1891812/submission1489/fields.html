    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the enzymatic addition of a methyl group  to the 5' carbon of cytosine, occuring at CpG dinucleotides. At the promoter of genes lie CpG islands these maintain a high frequency of CG nucleotide bases, and are typically unmethylated in normal cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG sites at a gene promoter upstrem of a transcriptional strart site is normally associated with silincing of gene expression. Methylation of the CpG islands is essential for proper embriyogenesis and normal development and invloved in processes such as chromasomal X-inactivation (condensation of the chromatin resulting from MeCP1 and MeCP2 binding methylated CPG nucleotides and repression of transcription) and is involved in genomic imprinting and gene supression. DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer through aberrant methylation patterns at CPG islands leading to both hypermethylation and hypomethylation. In cancer cells, promoters of CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and lead to silencing of the genes referred to as epigenetic silencing and are mitotically heritable. Silencing has the same effect as mutation leading to poliferation of the cancerous cell type.  In cancer epigenetic methylation typically requires tumor suppressor genes on both allels to be silenced as silencing of only one will not result in uncontrolled cell growth (cancer).  In colorectal cancer concordant hypermethylation of multiple genes is required this is known as 'CpG island methylator phenotype' CIMP occuring at CpG shores. </p>
<p>Interagenic regions are normally methylated DNA regions which maintain genomic integrity. In cancer global hypomethylation at these regions result in deletions, insertion and reciprical translocations(illigitamate recombinations b/tw repeats, evident in DNMT3B mutations). Silencing may occur via cryptic promoters and results in transcriptional interferance (logistical transcriptional stop). </p>
<p>Repetitive elements are normally methylated to protect the genome from transposable elements. In cancer there is global hypomethylation at repetitive elements which cause LTR genes to transpose themselves thoughout the genome interfer with transcription of genes, causing illegitimate recombination ultimatley resulting in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICR  (hypo and hypermethylation) can result in loss of gene expression or growth therefore not simply associated with silencing.</p>
<p>Looking at he H19/Igf2 cluster in the parental allele Igf2 is normally methylated.  In the presence of an CTCF (insulator protein) this methylation blocks binding of the CTCF to the ICR. The methylation of the ICR can spread to the H19 promoter (a CpG island promoter) heterochromatin spreads silencing H19 and allowing the downstream enhancers to activate expression of Igf2 oncogene.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF insulator protein is able to bind the ICR. This protein insulates Igf2 expression from the downstream enhancers.  The enhancers are now able to act on the unmethylated H19 gene enhancing it's expression.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor the maternal ICR is also methylated thus in this condition both the maternal and paternal inprint control regions are now methylated and there is an overexpression of Igf2 oncogene, allowing the methylated cells to divide rapidly competing out normal cells and becoming cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a hypomethylating agent it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase DNMTI. This drug is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and precursors of acute myelogenous leukeamia. These types of Haematological malignancies are dependant on tumor supressor gene hypermethylation thus the ability of Decitabine to inhibit the DNA methyltransferase and supress this hypermethylation results in anti tumor properties.</p>
<p>Decitabine has been show to be effective at low theraputic doses, as the rapidly growing cells sequester the Decitabine and induce hypomethylation in these hypermethylating cells.  Normal cells not growing as rapidly don't pick up the drug as readily resulting in incresed drug effectivness, minimal side effects. Also the effects on behaviour of a normal cell seems only to be minimal by comparison to the effects on the damaged cell. As the drug is not delivered at higest possible concentration their are minimal toxic effects. DNMTI drugs haven't been perscribed in children or pregnant women, the long term side effects remain unknown.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the DNA methylation may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment as these epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and are passed onto daughter cells during cell division and therefore ultimatly capable of stabilising cells to normal phenotype.</p>
<p>Sensitive period are those where DNA methylation (modification) is activly occuring. These periods include 'early development', 'primordial germ cell development' and to a lesser extent 'later specific stages of development'.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these periods is inadvisable for example a hypomethylating agent such as Decitabine would not be used to treat a pregnant woman especially when active epigenetic reprograming is occuring in early development a stage, where the blastocyte is re-establishing methylated epigenetic marks, as we would expect a hypomethylating agent to disrupt this process leading to epigenetic abnormalities.</p>
<p>Also certain drugs are inadvisable at specific stages of development, EZH2 used in colorectal cancer involved in H3K27 methylation (a represive epigenetic mark) would not be used on haematopoetic malignancies as they are also hypermethylators. the haematopoetic malignancies require hyopmethylators, indicating the tissue specificity of these drugs.</p>
