    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the CPG islands are unmethylated independente of their activity state. Most of promoters are located at CpG islands including the promoters of tumors of supressors genes. The methylation silences these tumor supressor genes, in this way it is one of many hits that can lead cells to cancer (Knudson hypotesis - cancer is a result of multiple hits in DNA). The intergenic regions and repetetive elements are methylated in normal cells. In cancer cells these regions are unmethylated and can lead to cancer, because these regions are responsible for regulating gene expression including many growth factors. Indeed the outcome of this hypomethylation will depende on what location will occur in the intergenic regions and repetetive elements. The hypomethylation of these regions can lead cells to genomic instability including illigitimate recombination between repeats (deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation), activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and d isruption to neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is heritable by mitosis of cells. The methylation pattern acquired during the cell life is transmitted over generations. The sensitive period happens at developing germ cells (imprited genes, maternal and paternal genome) and the period between gametes and epiblast (maternal and paternal genome). These periods is when occurs the reprogramming of methylation patterns by all cells of the body. The use of epigenetic drugs in these period can disrupt these methylation reprograming and can led to malformation of several tissues or can lead to several diesiases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some genes that shows monoallelic imprinting depending of parent origin. The normal cells only one of the allelic is methylated or silenced. In cancer cells both are expressed or silenced. This can lead to genomic instability since many genes are involved in growth promoting or growth suppressing. In this way in cancer cells it is found either regions that are hypomethylated and hypermethylated. In the case of H19/Igf2 in normal cells, the imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele permiting the CTCF insulator bind to the maternal ICR inibithing the enhacers to express Igf2 (silecing) and expressing H19. In the case of the paternal allele, what is seen is the ICR is mehylated leading to silecing the H19 (blocking the enhacers) and expressing the Igf2. In cancer cells the maternal allele also shows hypermethylation in ICR leading to expression of Igf2 like on the paternal allele. Now in cancer cells the Igf2 is overexpressed. The Igf2 is a growth promoter leading to tumorgenesis, called Wilm´s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This can slow tumor growth showed by the results of research shown by the Cance´s epicentre" article.  </p></div>
