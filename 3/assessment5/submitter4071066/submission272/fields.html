    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential for normal development. Its primary function is to maintain genome stability. It mainly occurs at CpG dinucleotides where DNA methyltransferases (DMNTs) lay down methyl marks de novo during development and maintain them in the daughter cell during cell division. It is a very stable epigentic mark.</p>
<p>Many CpGs, however, are found in island clusters (CPGIs) and these tend to be unmethylated in the normal cell. They are sites of transcriptional initiation. They enable promoter activity which allows gene expression in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs).</p>
<p>DNA methylation also occurs at intergenic regions and their repetitive elements which have the function of maintaining genomic stability. Cells without DNMT1 are unstable and DNA methylation at the intergenic regions prevents such things as chromosome translocations, deletions and insertions. They also silence cryptic transcription start or splice sites. At the repetitive elements the DNA methylation prevents transcriptional interference, illegitimate recombination and other epigenic aberrations.</p>
<p>In cancer, global changes in DNA methylation are seen: CpGIs become hypermethylated along with their CpGI neighbouring shores. This results in silencing TSGs and because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this is a very effective way of silencing them. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than genetic mutations, it is specific to tumour type and can happen in single genes and/or sets of genes. </p>
<p> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated and because most of the genome is made up of them, the whole genome is seen as hypomethylated.This has been observed in all tumour cells studied so far. When this happens we see epigenetic aberrations, as mentioned above. Because they are no longer heavily methylated and their DNA is no longer heterochromatised, repeats can transpose, activate neighbouring genes eg. the agoute gene in mice, and can jump to other regions with no regulation.</p>
<p><span>Thus we see that any epimutation leading to disruption of DNA methylation can lead to many diseases with devastating consequences.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinted genes undergo reprogramming only at the primordial germ cells (PGC) stage. Imprinting is always inherited in a parent-of-origin manner resulting in epigenetic differences which are critical for viability and health. </span></p>
<p><span>Expression is controlled at imprint control regions (ICRs) and the way the ICR brings about silencing differs by cluster. One method is by enhancer insulator blocking, as, for example, at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, the protein CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers promoting its expression so they promote expression of the H19 gene instead. </span></p>
<p><span>Because the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, the enhancers are free to act on the Igf2 gene so this is expressed and DNA methylation spreads to H19 to silence it.</span></p>
<p><span>Any disruption/mutation in the imprinting process can result in two maternal-like or two paternal-like alleles with devastating consequences. For instance, i</span>n Wilm's tumour, a mutation ocurs in the ICR maternal allele preventing CTCF binding resulting in it acting like the paternal allele. This results in too much growth promoting Igf2 being expressed and no/decreased expression of the growth restricting H19 gene to regulate it. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits DNAmethylase (DNMT). It is FDA approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML.</p>
<p>It is incorporated into the DNA during replication and when DNMT tries to bind to the nucleotide in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it is bound irreversibly by Decitabine instead so it can no longer be released. This shows that it is replication dependent. As cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells and are thus replicated more they are affected much more severely.</p>
<p>Decitabine is known to cause DNA demethylation but whether this is its only mechanism of action is unclear nor why it is most effective in myelodysplastic syndrome - perhaps it is dependent on CpGI hypermethylation which is known to have a poor prognosis for this disease. Now given at low doses it has a very good anti-neoplastic effect and is tolerated well by patients (usually elderly) giving them a longer life expectancy and quality of life.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigentic mark because it is mitotically inheritable, passing down to daughter cells at each cell division. All cells divide and this process is on-going.  If DNA methylation is altered the epimutation can also pass down in this fashion and thus have an enduring effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Unlike genetic mutations, epimutations are reversible. New drugs utilise this knowledge. They act by inhibiting specific tumour enzymes bringing them back towards normality which continues mitotically, even when the drug is stopped. Demethylation may also make tumour cells more amenable to standard treatment, such as chemotherapy, so that it can be given at lower doses.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is where the epigenome is most vulnerable/sensitive to environmental insults.; it is a period of active remodelling. It occurs during primordial cell development and pre and post implantation. During this time there is an increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Environmental factors early in life can have long-lasting impacts on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat at this time, preferable not to treat children or pregnant women. The adult epigenome can still be affected by environmental agents but it is less vulnerable to them so less dangerous to treat.</p></div>
