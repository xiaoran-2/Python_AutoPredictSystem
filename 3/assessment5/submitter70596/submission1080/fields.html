    <h1>Submission 1080 from Anon (session_user_id: 561d3a7b5dbd05cfe224fcdc20cb2594a853cdc8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Note: The below numbering refers to the associated bullit in the question cited above. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>DNA methylation is an epigenetic effect which is mitotically heritable, thus it can last for over many cell generations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are sensitive periods where one would seek to avoid treating patients.</div>
<div> </div>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, such that DNA methylation is passed on to subsequent cell generations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Sensitive periods refer to periods during cell development where the environment can alter the cells epigenetic state.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">There are two sensitive periods, which both occur during the active remodelling of the epigenome: 1) the period from the development of primordial germ cells through the production of the sperm and mature eggs, 2) the pre-implanted and early post implantation period.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as these are the periods where epigenetic reprogramming appears most sensitive to changes in the environment.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The main function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability and regulation of gene expression. CpG Islands (CGIs) are found in about 60% of promoter regions. Methylation of CGIs will stop expression of the associated gene.</li>
<li>As we move from CGIs in normal tissue to CGIs in cancer tissue, the likelihood and degree of DNA methylation increases. As cancer progresses, DNA methylation increases. Methylation of CGIs around the promoter region of cancer suppressor genes prevents them from being expressed, leading to higher risk of developing cancer. This can have quite drastic consequences as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. </li>
<li>Disruption of DNA methylation can cause cancer by a combination of activation of oncogenes and deactivation of tumour suppressor genes. One of the common features of cancer cells is loss of imprinting at imprint control regions (ICR), potentially due to either hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the ICR. In the former case, transcription factors will be able to bind to the affected region leading to transcription of both alleles. As most imprinted genes either promote growth or are growth suppressing, altered methylation patterns of these genes can lead to disease.</li>
<li>One of the main functions of DNA methylation is to promote genomic stability. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Repetitive elements are usually methylated to prevent these regions from engaging in recombination.</li>
<li>A common epigenetic alteration found in cancer involves locus-specific DNA hypermethylation. In cancerous tissues the methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is removed. Hypomethylation is most common in repetitive elements.</li>
<li>DNA hypomethylation will cause genomic instability. The intergenic regions and / or repeats will no longer be prevented from participating in illegitimate recombinations as the chromatin structure will be more open. This can cause disease in changing the DNA in protein coding regions, say.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Note: The below numbering refers to the associated bullit in the question cited above. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the above case, loss of imprinting leads to hypermethylation on the maternal allele causing the expression level of the growth promoting Igf2 to increase.</div>
<div> </div>
<ol><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele meaning that the transcription factor </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">CTCF 4 is unable to bind to the i</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">nsulator element, such that the </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">enhancer element does not act on H19, such that Igf2 is transcribed</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele meaning that the transcription factor </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">CTCF 4 binds to the i</span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">nsulator element, and the </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">enhancers act on H19, in which case Igf2 is NOT transcribed.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In Wilm's tumour, loss of imprinting leads to hypermethylation on the maternal allele such that both alleles are transcribed. This leads to double the amount of expression of Igf2 relative to a normal cell. This condition is </span></span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">often seen in </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">preneoplastic tissues.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Wilm's tumour contributes to disease by effecttively double the amount of expression of Igf2, which is growth promoting.</span></li>
