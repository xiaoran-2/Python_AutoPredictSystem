    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting involves differences in gene expression between alleles depending on parent of origin.  Normally, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, as is the promoter for H19.  This prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding to the ICR, so downstream enhancers promote expression of the Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor-2) gene.  On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the non-methylated ICR.  This physical blocking of downstream enhancers promotes expression of the non-methylated H19 gene, rather than Igf2, which is not expressed.</p>
<p>Loss of normal imprinting (LOI) can result in Wilm’s tumour, a childhood nephroblastoma, as well as other cancers.  The ICR and H19 promoter on the maternal allele both become abnormally methylated, so CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 expression is not silenced.  The paternal allele retains its normal methylation of the ICR and H19 promoter.  Rare paternal disomy produces the same effect.  With this disrupted imprinting pattern both alleles express growth-promoting Igf2, which may contribute to kidney tumourigenesis.  However, it has been postulated that disruption from aberrant long-range chromatin looping associated with LOI of Igf2 may induce carcinogenesis, as increased Igf2 levels alone are insufficient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (marked as Dacogen), which is FDA approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), including progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It specifically targets the DNA methylation component of the epigenetic machinery.  It is a cytidine nucleoside analogue.  After incorporation into the DNA during cell replication, it irreversibly binds DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), so that it cannot copy methyl marks, present at 5-methylcytosines on the parent strand, to the cytosine residues on the daughter strand of DNA.  In highly sensitive, rapidly dividing cancer cells, it presumably reverses the DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, which is a hallmark of cancer and normally a poor prognosticator for MSD.  This should help restore silenced tumour-suppressor genes and control cell growth.  However, the exact mechanism of its tumour-killing effect is unclear.  It may also act as an antimetabolite, being directly cytotoxic to rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic alternation of DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because the methyl mark, present at 5-methylcytosines, is copied during DNA replication, by the DNA methyltransferase, DMNT1, from the parent strand, to the cytosine residues on the daughter strand of DNA.  This maintains a faithful and enduring methylation of the DNA through progressive somatic cells divisions.  Erasure of such methyl groups by DNA-demethylating drugs would also be faithfully copied through somatic cell divisions.   Such treatment may be inadvisable during sensitive periods, i.e., during the epigenetic reprogramming, that occurs during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation development of the zygote.  During these periods, when there is differential clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks including DNA methylation, any intervention could affect the epigenome of future generations via alterations to epigenetic markings of the gametes, or the cell-type-specific epigenome of somatic cells of the future baby, respectively.  This could lead to epigenetic-induced diseases if patients are treated during these critical "sensitive periods" when the epigenetic machinery is most sensitive to disruption by external influences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG (cytosine-guanine) dinucleotides are clustered into CpG islands (CGIs) in approximately 60% of mammalian gene promoters.  While 70-80% of somatic cell CpGs are methylated at cytosine C5, CGIs normally remain unmethylated irrespective of their expressive activity.  Epigenetic control involves dynamically methylating small subsets of CPIs at different times and in different cell types, and in the later stages of X-chromosome inactivation.  This effectively silences affected genes, via binding MeCP proteins that induce chromatin condensation, and prevents inappropriate gene expression. </p>
<p>In cancer, locus-specific DNA at CGIs and CGI shores is hypermethylated especially in tumour-suppressor genes.  This alternative to DNA mutation silences expression of these regulators of cell growth, apoptosis or DNA repair.  CGI hypermethylation promotes tumourigenesis because tumour-suppressor-gene silencing is stable and mitotically heritable, so affected cells have a selection advantage for uncontrolled growth.  As GGI hypermethylation progresses, tumours become invasive and metastasise.</p>
<p>DNA in CpGs in repetitive elements, and intergenic regions, is normally methylated to prevent inappropriate expression of these elements, which include retroviral remnants and satellite repeats.  Methylation of intergenic regions is associated with genomic stability, and silencing of expression of cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites.  Methylation of repetitive elements promotes genomic stability by preventing their transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypomethylation of repetitive elements is extremely common, but is less common in intergenic regions, including CpG-poor promoters, where it can up-regulate oncogene expression, or activate miRNA targeting of tumour suppressors.  Now free to transposition, repetitive elements disrupt gene expression (their strong promoters inappropriately induce continual expression), or directly mutate genes by their insertion.  Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions promotes genomic instability (including karyotype abnormalities), and deregulates tissue specific and imprinted genes.  All this promotes progressive tumorogenesis.</p></div>
