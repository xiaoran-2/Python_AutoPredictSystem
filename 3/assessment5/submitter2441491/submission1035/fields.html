    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated, which helps them do their job in regulatig gene expression and transcription.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands occur in cancer. As they are usually unmethylated, methylation happens gradually through the stages of cancer. Starting with low methylation with hyperpalsia and very high methylation with invasion and metastasis.</p>
<p>CpG islands methylation changes during cancer may lead to hypermethylation of Tumor Supressor genes that decrease the supressing effect. It also leads to metylation of CpG island shores around the islands which also have regulating effect and this leads to disregulation of many genes. Hypermethylation of other genes may be associated with metastasis like miR-34b/c.<br />Hypermethylation of ICRs may lead to loss of imprinting, and this can lead to many effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated, and this helps to keep the integrity og the chromatin.</p>
<p>During cancer, demethylation of these regions occur, which makes them hypomethylated. In contrast to CpG islands, these regions are somehow methylated in hyperplasia and hypomethylated in invasion.</p>
<p>These changes in methylation in these regions may apply their effects in a couple of ways depending on the site. They may over activate Oncogenes, which are growth promoters. A more important way of action is the activation of repeats, which may cause Genomic Instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele: methylated ICR, so the insulator CTCF does not bind to it. Therefor, The inhancers act on the igf2 and activate it.</p>
<p>Maternal allele: ICR is not methylated, CTCF binds to the ICR. Hence, inhancers activate the H19 gene while the CTCF blocks the action of the inhancers on the igf2. Therefor, igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor: The maternal allele has loss of imprinting, and the ICR is methylated on it as well as the Paternal allele. Therefor, igf2 is expressed on both of the alleles.</p>
<p>While igf2 is expressed on both alleles, a double amount of it is expressed. As igf2 is a growth promoter, this leads to Wilm's Tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents or DNMTi.</p>
<p>Decitabine irriversibly binds to DNMT when it is trying to sustaine methylation in the daughter cells. The DNA becomes less methylated in the cell, and this is passed down to its daughter cells and so on. Therefor it causes demethylation of a complete lineage of cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine may have it's anti MDS effect, because the disease is probably caused by CpG islands hypermethylation. These CpG islands are believed to promote growth. So, a drug that helps demethylate these islands may have an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed down to daughter cells and their daughter cells. However, a change in this methylation is also passed down. So, altering DNA methylation in one cell, can change the expression in all the line of cells.<br />These changes may lead to activating or silencing of genes that may have other epigenetic functions. Therefor, one change may have multiple effects, and as mentioned, lasting effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the epigenome is being "re-made". Any influence in that time can change the epigenome drastically.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are the period just after gestation and in the blastocyst, and while making the gametes.</p>
<p>During these sesitive periods, the epigenome is very susceptible to change even from small things -or even the environment-, changes that are not usually good. So for example, adding a methylating agent to the diet in one of these periods, will lead to a widely hypermethylated epigenome. And it is the same for other epigenetic modifications.</p></div>
