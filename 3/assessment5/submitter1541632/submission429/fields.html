    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are usually unmethylated in normal cells and that would be associated with gene expression. Methylation of CpG island is associated in silencing of the genes usually regulated by that cluster of CpGs. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated which would result in silencing expression of certain genes. Thoses now silenced genes are likely to code for useful and necessary tools for the well being of a cell, which will not function correctly anymore.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually tend to be methylated for genome stability. In cancer, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated there for disrupting genome stability. Genome cand undergo deletion of genes, insertions, translocations, etc, and this result in a cell not properly functioning.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is methylation in intergenic region of the H19/lgf2 cluster on the paternal allele which allows expression of lgf2 by enhancers H19 is not expressed as the gene is methylated. There is no methylation at this same region on the maternal allele therefore, there is expression of H19 and there is blocking by CTCF of the lgf2 gene by enhancers. There is no expression of lgf2 then. Any disruption of gene control can lead to disease.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This drug is used to counter the effects of hypermethylation in cancer. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation (and hypermethylation), the frequency of DNA methylation shinks. This effect could potentially affect normal cells as well but it’s effect is seems more pronounced in tumor cells because of the high need for DNA methylation in a hypermethylation condition and their faster rate of proliferation. By reducing DNA methylation, you disrupt tumor growth which will ultimately lead to apoptosis of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically inheritable through the DNA methylation with DNMT1 on copied genes. This is useful for epigenetic control of gene expression over lifetime. During early development and primordial germ cells development, there is a reprogramming of epigenetic marks happening. Those are called sensitive periods because there is loss of epigenetic marks and reinstallation of these marks. The use of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase during these periods could have harsh consequences on the epigenome and on the normal development of the fetus.</p></div>
