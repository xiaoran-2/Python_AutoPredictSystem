    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the transfer of methyl groups (-CH3) to some of the bases cytosine (C) of DNA prior located contiguously to a guanine (G). These CpG islands are regions between 0.5 and 5.5 kb containing CG dinucleotides at least 55% (assume 1% of the genome and are generally not methylated).</p>
<p>Malignant cells are accompanied by an overall hypomethylation is associated with the activation of genes required for invasion and metastasis, via oncogenetics-(quantification techniques of methylation) and a Local hypermethylation (CpG islands) related to the suppression of tumor suppressor genes-suppressor pathway, (techniques for detection of specific genes CpG).</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG islands is a signal that triggers a change in the chromatin, which prevents transcription of the gene. In a normal state, methylation is a mechanism that regulates, among other processes, tissue differentiation to silence certain genes in certain tissues. But when methylation is deregulated genes and affects not be silenced pathological process may begin. Aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes rovoca one uncontrolled processes of the cell cycle, as well as aberrant gene methylation metastasis inhibitors, facilitates tumor cell escape. The consequence of this has an effect methylation deregulated compared to that produced by a mutation in the gene coding sequence.</p>
<p>The partial and chimeric gene duplications contribute to the formation of new genes. The chimeric genomic sources have different exons, including gene and intergenic regions, and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Unmethylated CpG areas centennial DNA and DNA from all compartments occupied nonagenarians genomic: promoters (located at ± 2 kb of the start point of transcription), exons, introns and intergenic regions. When comparing the different types of regions between DNA and DNA centenary of the newborn, have found that the DNA of the centenary, compared with NB, had more unmethylated CpGs in CpG poor promoters and promoters with methylated CpG islands. The same was found in the comparison between 19 and 19 nonagenarians newborns.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Regulation of H19 and IGF2 genes in mouse (having opposite imprinting patterns) is performed by this mechanism, since CTCF acts as an insulator (insulator) Igf2 promoter about distant enhancers.</p>
<p>H19 and IGF2 genes form a cluster on mouse reciprocal imprinting so that Igf2 is expressed only on the paternal chromosome and H19 is expressed only on the maternal chromosome. Regulation of this cluster is performed by a factor called CTCF insulator, which binds to a region of differential methylation.</p>
<p>H19 and IGF2 are oppositely imprinted with only the maternal and the paternal alleles expressed, respectively. In Wilms tumor, a childhood renal neoplasm, loss of the H19/IGF2 imprinted expression pattern results in silencing of H19 and biallelic expression of IGF2. This was shown to be associated with biallelic methylation of the H19 promoter in the tumor and the adjacent kidney tissue suggesting that epigenetic H19 silencing is an early event in Wilms tumorigenesis. An imprinting mark region characterized by paternal allele-specific methylation has been suggested to reside in a GC-rich region of 400-base pair direct repeats starting at -2 kilobase pairs (kb) relative to the H19 transcription start and extending upstream.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), an analogue of the natural nucleoside 2'-deoxycytidine and is part of the group of drugs hypomethylation. Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>Decitabine exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing DNA hypomethylation and cell differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro, which was achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to the genes that are critical to the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine can also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenome pharmacological manipulation, for example, the use of deacetylase inhibitors reverses the detrimental brain functions in aged organisms. Sirtuins, a group of NAD +-dependent deacetylases that are conserved from yeast to mammals, are one of the key molecular mechanisms in epigenetic regulation of longevity and the aging process. Overexpression of these proteins in mouse brain reverses gene silencing loss associated with aging and promotes genomic stability.<br />Epigenetic regulation of spatial and tejidoespecífica metazoans suggests that the design and implementation of pharmacological and therapeutic strategies to combat deterioration and aging-related diseases should consider physiological heterochrony experienced with the passage of age.<br />From the clinical perspective and for being dynamic and modular processes, an approach aging epigenetics opens the possibility of modulating the progression or the impact of the passage of time at the detriment of physiology in humans.</p></div>
