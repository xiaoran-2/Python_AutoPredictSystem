    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes and they are not generally methylated in the normal somatic tissues. However, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer cells. This cause silencing of the underlying tumor suppressor genes, working as an alternative way to mutate them. In fact, this tumor suppressor hypermethylation is even more common than their mutation in cancer and it can act as one of the several hits in the tumorigenesis. Besides, the pattern of CpG island methylation is specific of tumor type.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in normal cells to keep them as heterochromatin, and so ensuring genomic stability. However, these regions are found hypomethylated in cancer cells. Regarding the repetitive elements, this causes genomic instability by recombination between repeats, insertion in other region, activation of neighboring genes; and this genomic instability is responsible of the cancer development.</p>
<p>With regards to the intragenic regions, the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can be related to activation of certain genes with oncogenic function.</p>
<p>Finally, both CpG island hypermethylation and intergenic and repetitive elements hypomethylation are extend in cancer with time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is an imprinting control region (ICR) downstream IGF2, a gene involved in promoting cell growth, and upstream H19. And this ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele so an insulator factor binds to it. This allows the enhancers downstream H19 to act over this gene and promote its expression, keeping IGF2 silenced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ICR is methylated in the parental allele, which also affects H19 downstream so, as there is no insulator factor, the enhancers can act over IGF2 promoting its expression. So, because of the imprinting, IGF2 is only expressed in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>So, when there is loss of imprinting, both alleles have the ICR methylated, giving as a result an overexpression of IGF2 (double dose of IGF2 comparing to a normal cell). And, as IGF2 is growth promoting this is finally related to Wilm’s tumour, a type of child kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltranferase inhibitors. These drugs are nucleoside analogs, so DNA methyltransferases irreversibly bind them and they can no longer be released, preventing the methylation to the daughter cell to take place, so they are division-dependent. Although they might act through other mechanisms as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, as cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, they are more affected by these drugs. DNA methyltransferases are often mutated in cancer, so epigenetic mistakes dowstream can take place because of these mutations. So, due to the fact that these changes are reversible, these epigenetic modifiers are target to cancer drugs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is approved by the FDA to be used in myelodysplastic syndrome that progresses to acute myeloid leukemia. The reason why it is useful against this syndrome can due to the fact that dense CpG hypermethylation is related with poor prosnostic in this type of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome due to the fact that it can be mitotically inherited by daughter cells in a lineage-specific way. However, there are two periods during the development where the epigenetic reprogramming takes place: in the early embryo development (the pre-implantation period) and in the primordial germ cells development. These two periods are known as sensitive periods. In the first one the paternal genome is demethylated rapidly comparing to the maternal genome and, in the second one, both of the male and female germ cells are demethylated simultaneously, but the methylation in the mature egg is re-established later on. Thus, if an epigenetic drug acts in one of these periods (i.e. during pregnancy or childhood…) the normal epigenetic reprogramming can be disrupted so it might result in epigenetic abnormalities, such as aberrant imprinting, development disorders or even cancer. This is the reason why using epigenetic drugs in these sensitive periods is inadvisable.</p></div>
