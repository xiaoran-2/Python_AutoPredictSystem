    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally unmethylated and this allows the underlying gene to be expressed.  In cancer cells, however, CpG islands are more likely to become hypermethylated and this silences the underlying gene.  The genes silenced by hypermethylation are tumour suppressing genes.  Normally, they would suppress tumours, but with hypermethylation they become inactive.  This hypermethylation of CpG islands increases with time.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.  Methylation and heterochromisation of these regions keeps the genome stable. </p>
<p>Cancer, however, disrupts the stability of the genome by removing methylation from the intergenic regions, repetitive elements (repeats), and CpG poor promoters.  Of these, it is the removal of methylation from the repeats that is the biggest factor in destabilising the genome.  Demethylation of repeats causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, such as reciprocal translocations between chromosomes in areas of repeats that look identical or are identical.  Repeats can also be activated and thus can copy themselves and disrupt the genome by hopping into other genes, sometimes disrupting coding regions and sometimes activating genes around them.  This activity of jumping around the genes causes deletions of parts of chromosomes and insertions in other parts, as well as reciprocal translocations. CpG poor promoters also become hypomethylated, activating oncogenes.</p>
<p>In brief, cancer causes genome-wide hypomethylation, and, at the same time, it also causes hypermethylation of specific regions of the genome.  In other words, the normal epigenetic state is reversed.  Note that the role of methylation is, however, context-dependent, that is, sometimes, it is the hypermethylation of a particular area of the genome that is driving the cancer, but sometimes it is the hypomethylation of a particular area that is the driving force.  This driving force might change over time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the paternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, that is, the H19/lgf2 cluster is paternally imprinted.  This methylation blocks CTCF, an insulator protein, from binding to the Imprint Control Region (ICR).  This allows enhancers to work on Igf2, activating it.  In brief, paternal imprinting activates Igf2 expression.  As well, methylation spreads to H19, silencing it.  Thus, Igf2 is active on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Normally, the maternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated.  This means that CTCF, the insulator protein, can bind to the ICR, and thus, this block the enhancers from activating Igf2.  Instead, the enhancers activate, through their preferred path, H19.  Thus, Igf2 is silent on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In cancer you can find both hypomethylation and hypermethylation of ICRs.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and the paternal allele for the H19/Igf2 cluster are hypermethylated, meaning that now there is overexpression of Igf2, to be exact, you get a double dose of Igf2.  The gene Igf2 promotes growth and this overdose of growth expression is associated with Wilm's tumour, a childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors to which the drug Decitabine belongs is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation.  It does this by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) during cell division.  Cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells, so they are more affected by Decitabine than normal cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because it can demethylate tumour-suppressor genes.  These genes are supposed to stop tumour growth, but because they have been methylated, they have been silenced.  By removing the methylation, the genes can be expressed again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be passed on during mitosis (cell division).  This means that by altering the DNA methylation in one set of cells, these changes can be passed on to daughter cells.  This in itself creates an enduring effect that will last until the changes are erased, and, once erased, this erasure will endure.  This might mean that epigenetic drugs don't have to kill all the cancer cells in order to stop them from growing; just making changes to the epigenome and letting that pass on through generations of cells might be enough. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are those periods when changes in the environment can have an effect on epigenetic control, that is, periods of active epigenetic remodelling.  There are two main sensitive periods: (1) the pre-implantation and post-implantation period and (2) the period of primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm.  Treating patients during these sensitive periods, such as in pregnancy, would be inadvisable because the changes could because they could affect gametes (egg and sperm cells), that is, they could cause transgenerational effects that could affect the children of the patients.</p></div>
