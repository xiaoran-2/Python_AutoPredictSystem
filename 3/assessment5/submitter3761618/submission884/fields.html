    <div class="field-value"><p>*DNA methylation at CpG islands:<br /> DNA methylation at CpG islands  aims at gene silencing through formation of repressive chromatin structure &amp; interfering with transcription factors binding e.g. XCI. They are usually unmethylated. In cancerous cells, CGI hypermethylation occurs in tumor suppressor genes leading to its inactivation "more frequent than tumor suppressor gene mutation". This may occur in single genes e.g. RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, MGMT in gliomas &amp; BRCA gene in breast cancer or sets of genes like what happens in colorectal carcinoma.On the other hand, CpG poor promoters hypomethylation leads to its activation "oncogenes" e.g. R-Ras in gastric cancers.</p>
<p>* DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:</p>
<p>DNA methylation here aims at maintaining genomic integrity. They are usually methylated. In repeats,methylation  maintains genomic integrity through prevention of transposition, avoidance of transcriptional interference &amp; prevention of illegitimate recombination. In intergenic regions, methylation maintains genomic integrity through maintains genomic integrity through silencing of specific transcription start sites or specific splice sites. This is evident in both human diseases "non-cancerous &amp; cancerous". Immunodeficiency -centromeric instability- facial anomalies syndrome</p>
<p> have mutation in DNMT3B. It is also evident in many human cancers.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting means allele specific expression based on parent-of-origin of the allele. One of examples is, H19/Igf2 cluster located in Chr. 11. The paternal allele is methylated, so the insulator protein CTFC can't bind leading to enhanced expression of the paternal copy of Igf2. On the other hand, the maternal allele is unmethylated, so the insulator protein CTFC binds isolating enhancers from Igf2 clusters preventing their expression.</p>
<p>Abnormalities leading to overexpression of Igf2, with abnormalities leading to loss of the imprinted gene Kcnq1, leads to the development of Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome. The eventual result of these abnormalities is that the maternal allele behaves as a paternal one. This maybe due to mutations leading to loss of imprinting, uniparental disomy or disruption of the epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>The main features of this syndrome is fetal and post-natal overgrowth (loss of Cdkn1c "growth suppressor gene", overdose Igf2 "growth promoting gene &amp; predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumours, but not ADULT tumours e.g. WILM’s tumour in the kidney.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of The FDA approved drugs working through inhibition of DNMT. This is a nuceloside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent. Eventually DNA will be hypomethylated. It is used mainly in treatment of hematologic malignancies mainly MDS. There are trials to use it in solid malignancies as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the proposed epigenetic modifications. Epigenetics is the study of mitotically heritable changes in gene expression that occur without changes in DNA sequence. Thus, DNA methylation helps defining the genes to be expressed. It is present in three areas. The first is the CpG islands which are usually unmethylated, but its methylation leads to gene silencing e.g. XCI. Also, it is present is intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genome stability. Alteration of this pattern of DNA methylation contributes to many diseases, the most important of it is cancerous processes. For further discussion of role of DNA methylation alteration in cancer, refer to question one answer.</p>
<p>Sensitive period regarding epigenetic marks is the period of development during which epigenetic marks are erased then laid down again to be inherited by future cells. There are two sensitive periods described. The first is the period of early development of the embryo "pre-implantation phase". The second is the period "primordial germ cell development".</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods may lead to the development of many diseases due epigenetic marks disruption.This occurs due to altered DNA methylation, loss of imprinting .....etc.</p></div>
