    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are DNA regions enriched with cytosine and guanine commonly present within promoters. Around 50% of human genes are regulated by promoters with CpG islands (1), and the methylation in these dinucleotides allows the gene silencing. In several tumours, like gastric, lung, ovarian cancers and others, it has been found that aberrant DNA methylation deregulates the expression of key genes. When the CpG islands are unmethylated in some dinucleotides, the gene expression may be that of activation, but when the CpG islands are hypermethylated an aberrant silencing of gene expression leads to tumorigenesis in a tissue (2). When the CpG islands are outside the promoter region, body CpG islands, the methylation of CpG sites may lead to transcriptional activation (2). In much cases, the ageing has been correlated with the carcinogenesis and the methylation of CpG islands, as it might be the case of hypertension and some kidney diseases, which also progress with ageing and it has been studied on the activity of the 11β-HSD2 enzyme in human cells <em>in vitro</em> and with rat cells <em>in vivo </em>(3).</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the DNA sequence are non-coding sequences but they may have a role in the regulation of the genome and the maintenance of its stability. When these regions are hypomethylated, the most common effect is that of genomic instability. The genomic instabilty can be found in the mutation of the DNMT3B gene that codes for a dinucleotide-methylase, the phenotype of this mutation is the Immunodeficiency, Centromerical-instability and Facial anomalies syndrome (ICF) where there is a low level of immunoglobines and a set of abnormalities in the facial anatomy (4). Also, some tumours, like that one of R-RAS (an oncogene) in the stomach cancer, are dependents of the genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 group is found in the human chromosome 11. CTCF is an isolator protein that isolates the Igf2 gene downstream from the enhancers by binding the unmethylated ICR region. When the ICR is methylated, as it happens in the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and the enhancers express the Igf2 protein, and the H19 promoter methylates accordingly. On the maternal allele, CTCF can bind the ICR region, which stays unmethylated, and the enhancers cannot longer have access to Igf2, expressing H19 which codifies for a long non-coding RNA that blocks Igf2 on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>When both alleles have the ICR methylated, the enhancers on both alleles get to Igf2 gene, since CTCF cannot longer bind to any ICR region. This disruption is typical of the Wilm's tumour. Since Igf2 are growth factors, they enhance the cell growth and proliferation, producing neoplasias within the kidney. This is an example of how the ICR hypermethylation can lead to the overexpression of growth factors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, this means that is an analogue of nucleosides and it's incorporated to the DNA. Once the DNMT binds this analogue, the enzyme is not longer able to be released and, therefore, forbids the methylation during the cell replication. In low doses, the decitabine can prevent the DNA methylation in tumours driven by the hypermethylation of CpG islands (In the case of decitabine, the incorporation within the DNA traps the DNMT and allows its degradation, since it is a nucleoside analogue, it stays in the genome as replication progresses). As this is an epigenetic effect, the anti-tumour effect is then mitotically inherited to daughter cells. Also, since the decitabine affects only to the replicating cells, is more likely to affect neoplastic cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMT inhibitors interfere with the DNA methylation, therefore, once the drug treatment is done, the DNMT inhibitors stays in the genome and keep demethylating the genome, though in a lower rate (hemimethylated strand). This can lead to a genomic instability that is enhanced when chemotherapy is applied to the tissue making the tumour more susceptible.</p>
<p>However, the epigenetic drugs have not specificity yet, so any cell can be targeted by the drug: the more susceptible cells to uptake the drug are those who continuously replicate. But there are some sensitive periods during development. A sensitive period is featured by the erasure of the epigenetic marks, mainly by demethylation. During the fertilisation, the DNA demethylation progresses reaching the lowest level at the blastocyst stage and if at this point DNMTi incorporate within the genome, the DNA methylation might be disrupted, being inadvisable to treat with such drugs during pregnancy. Also, this epigenetic clearing is observed during the germ-cell line development, later in pregnancy and foetal development. In women, the oocytes remains with a cleared epigenome since the oocytes finish their mitosis until the ovulation and any environmental change can produce an alteration on the gametes' epigenome.</p>
