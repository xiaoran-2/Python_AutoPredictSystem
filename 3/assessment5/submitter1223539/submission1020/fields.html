    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation occurs mainly at what we call CpG islands, in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This DNA methylation is responsible of switching on and off the expression of the targeted genes; but most of the time it is equivalent to a gene/region silencing. Several factors can disrupt the lay down of DNA methylation; During cancer we observe a hypermethylation of the CpG island and an hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats (the contrary of the normal lay down).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The root causes that trigger these changes in methylation are not known yet, but DNA mutation is considered as the factor inducing these changes -- DNA mutation may be due to epigenetic factor that’s is why the root causes is not yet clearly known. DNA mutations can result in mutated histone, the expression of new non coding RNA, or new/mutated enzymes (ie methyltransferases). With these different or new element the methylation can’t be maintain (dysfunctional enzymes), methylation is removed in some area (histone, enzyme), and target different area of the DNA strand (non coding RNA, mutated, histone).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The hypermethylation of CpG islands can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor gene, or the silencing of gene that lead to the expression of  oncogenes resulting in cancer.</span></p>
<p><br /><span>The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements modify the 3D structure of the chromosome and activate genes that should be silenced, resulting in an instability of the karyotype (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes). With such instability, the normal function of the cell is disrupt and can lead to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene (if overexpressed it is considered as oncogene), it’s expression is regulated by a specific imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster: on the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated resulting in the binding of CTCF on the ICR blocking the downstream enhancer to act on Igf2; on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated letting the downstream enhancer access to the Igf2 gene.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A disruption in imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, would either diminish the expression of the Igf2 gene (a maternal allele that is like a paternal one) or increase its expression (a paternal allele that is like a maternal one) resulting into an unbalanced expression of growth promoter (overgrowth or undergrowth diseases).</span></p>
<p><br /><span>In the Wilm’s tumour there is hypermethylation of ICR in H19/Igf2 cluster. The maternal allele is therefore methylated as the paternal one (loss of methylation status imprinting). This leads to an overexpression of the Igf2 gene (oncogene). It result in a kidney tumour in child.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The Decitabine belongs to the DNMT inhibitors class of drugs. Therefore Decitabine tends to remove the methylation after each cell division -- the methylation is no more maintains because of the inhibition of DNMT (methyltransferase).</span></p>
<p><span>As cancer cells divide more often compare to healthy cells, they are more sensible to the drug, the cancer daughters cells will have CpG islands unmethylated (roughly as in the healthy cells) and we can hope that the tumor suppressor genes will be reactivated and or oncogenes deactivated because of activation of other genes that inhibit these oncogenes. The drug will help the population of tumour cells to decrease.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. That is why the drug effect can last beyond the treatment period.</span></p>
<p><br /><span>A sensitive period in term of epigenetic, is a period of epigenetic change as the teens period. Treating a patient with this kind of drug during a sensitive period could disrupt the normal cells epigenome, in particular gamete cells. This could result to bad phenotype in the next generation due to errors in the epigenome induced by the drugs.That's why it's not advised to use this kind of drug suring sensitive period. "Hopefully" cancers happen more oftenly in more advanced age when procreation is no more a question and extend the patient life is more critical.<br /></span></p></div>
