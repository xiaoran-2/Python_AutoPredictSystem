    <div class="field-value"><p>Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called <em>CpG islands</em>, which are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes. Methylation at those islands downregulates or upregulates their expression levels, depending on what transcriptional elements are blocked by it. In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter <em>CpG islands</em> acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing and cause neoplasia. Tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression. CpG island hypermethylation has been described in almost every tumor type. Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair (hMLH1, MGMT), cell cycle (p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), p14(ARF)), apoptosis (DAPK), cell adherence (CDH1, CDH13), detoxification (GSTP1).</p>
<p>It is known that the methylation of intragenic regions can impair modifications such as acetylation, chromatin methylation or accesibility of chromatin remodelers to the area. Loss of methylation in such areas can also cause the same problems. Furthermore, since many RNAs that do not code for any proteins, but play a very important role in gene silencing and in DNA-protein complex formation, originate from such intragenic regions it is possible that any epigenetic alteration can have an important impact on gene expresion paterns. By comparing a healthy cell with a tumor cell we can infer that such discrepancies in epigenetic modifications are spread throughout the genome and may be comensurately responsible for the disease development. The depletion methylation of transposable elements in cancer cells is also considered to be important since such elements can relocate in the genome and cause disfunctions due to impaired mRNA products. In healthy cells this anomaly is suppressed by maintaining the methylation of such regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Textbody"><em>IGF2</em> encodes a mitogen and fetal growth promoting protein, which is one of the most frequently dysregulated genes in human cancers. Evidence indicates that its overexpression may contribute to the early stages of tumorigenesis.The copy of the paternally transmitted copy is active (hypermethylated H19) whereas the maternally inherited one is inactive (hypomethylated H19) due to imprinting. In many occasions cancers frequently display relaxation of imprinting (sometimes called loss of imprinting) of imprinted genes, including <em>IGF2</em>. When imprinting is relaxed, the inactive imprinted allele becomes activated to give biallelic, and increased, expression which leads to the development of neoplasia.  <em>IGF2</em> displays maternal allele-specific methylation in normal kidney that is absent in Wilms tumors which exhibited biallelic expression of <em>IGF2. </em>It is absence of imprinting that causes this bialelic expression that transforms healthy cells and gives rise to tumor cells. The overexpression of this mitogen actually distrupts the cells' normal proliferation allowing them to proliferate recalcitrantly and give rise to tumor cells, in this specific occasion it forms what is known as Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs in the group of DNA-demethylating agents. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is a cytidine analog that is incorporated only into DNA. It is the deoxy-derivative of azacitidine. Epigenetics are used by the cell to regulate gene expression. Some major transcription factors (like myc) are definitely regulated by epigenetic mechanisms (controlled by BRD4). Anti-epigenetics drugs can lower the gene expression levels, contributing to lowering malignancy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes (unlike drug therapies) persist and are passed during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods in a person's life where groups of cells undergo vigorous epigenetic reprogramming. Any disruption in those periods can lead to severe epigenetic abnormalities which can doom not only the specific person, but also its downstream lineage. Those two periods in the humans are the embryonic development phase (obviously) and the early stages of his life (pre-puberty and puberty, where germline cells are reprogrammed).</p>
<p>The treatment of patients during sensitive periods could disrupt the normal epigenetic mechanisms. If the patient is pregnant, then it can severely interfere with normal development of the embryo. If the patient is going through germline reprogramming, then the therapy could affect their offspring and their downstream lineage.</p></div>
