    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals and is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states. The methylation pattern is faithfully passed into dividing somatic cells in a similar fashion as the genetic code. In normal cells DNA methylation CpG island is usually unmethylated and usually methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons).</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, the genome-wide hypomethylation leads to genomic instability where intergenic regions and repetitive elements are demethylated. Is a characteristic feature in Human disease, for example in ICF syndrome that shows a mutation in <em>DNMT3B.</em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We can have hypermethylation in some instances and hypomethylation in other imprint control regions. For example Let’s see the IGF2 H19 cluster. It's methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression. On the paternal allele, because  this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to intulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele. However, with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.  Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types and occurs as a very early  event, so it's often seen in preneoplastic  tissues. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It’s a DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor) used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that has progressed to AML (acute myeloide leukemia). Decitabine was one of the first set of drug approved by FDA in a clinical trial, nucleoside analog that get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. And this means that the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating like cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period is Inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression patterns from parent to offspring by passage through the germ cells, not explained by genetic differences. (Sensitive periods during embryogenesis/gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained).Are sensitive periods:  PGC(primordial germ cell) and early development.</p></div>
