    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is that the promoters of actively expressed genes are not methylated.  The CpG islands may be methylated to suppress the gene in special cases like X inactivation and imprinting.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation of CpG islands is usually disrupted in cancer by methylational of the normally unmethylated CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, that is hypermethylation of the tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>This disruption of the DNA methylation at the CpG islands of the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes turns off these tumor suppressor genes.  The result of not having tumor suppressor genes active is that tumors can grow.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to use methylation to suppress the repetitive elements and any promoter regions not associated with genes.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in hypomethylated in cancer.  That is, most or all normal methylation in the repetitive and intergenic regions is missing.</p>
<p>This disruption of DNA methylyation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to diseases by fostering genetic instability.  Genetic instability means that repetitive elements can act as transposons and jump to other areas of the genome where they can land in the middle of a gene thus disrupting this gene's function. Genetic instability may also result in chromosomal truncation, insertion or translocations.  These chromosomal rearrangements can cause promoter regions to act on the wrong genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is that the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and the H19 gene is methylated.  The methylation of the ICR prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR.  Since the ICR is not hidden by CTCF, the enhancers can act on the gene Igf2 and cause it to be expressed.</p>
<p>The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is that the ICR is not methylated.  Since the ICR is not methylated CTCF can bind to it.  This action by CTCF hides the ICR from the enhancers so that they act on the H19 gene rather than on Igf2.</p>
<p>The imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor by methylating the ICR on the maternal as well as the paternal allele.</p>
<p>This disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf cluster means that the maternal allele acts just like the paternal allele.  Both alleles now have the ICR methylated which mean that in both alleles the enhancers act to express the Igf2.  Since Igf2 is a growth factor, it acts like an oncogene and encourages growth of Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is when the cell is dividing and DNA is being replicated Decitabine binds to DNMT1.  When Decitabine binds to DNMT1, then DNMT1 no longer can copy the DNA methylation to the daugher strands.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by preventing DNMT1 from copying the DNA methylation to the daughter strands.  This means that the daughter cells do not have DNA methylation on the tumor suppressor genes.  This means that the tumor suppressor genes are active and can kill the tumor cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by setting epigenetic marks that are stable for the lifetime of the cell and are mitiotically heritable to the daughter cells when the cell divides.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when the epigenome is being reprogrammed in the cells.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are when the primordial germ cells are being reprogrammed and during the early embryo stage when epigenetic marks on much of the genome are being reprogrammed. Specific tissues may have other sensitive periods when they are developing. The usual sensitive periods are during pregnacy and during childhood.  </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the epigenetic marks for all the cells, not just the ones targeted.  This setting of non-targetted epigenetic marks means that unforseen side effects might be caused.  These side effects might not show up until many years later.</p></div>
