    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic processes and is a stable epigenetic mark. However, aberrations in DNA methylation can lead to various diseases. For instance, in normal cells, there is hypomethylation of CpG islands and genes can be expressed normally like tumour suppressor genes. When methylation of CpG islands occur, the normal function of genes is disrupted as in cancer cells. As cancer progresses, there is an increase in the methylation of CpG islands on tumour suppressors which silences the tumour suppressor gene and tumours occur. Hypomethylation is also seen in cancer. In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In a cancer cell, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs and disrupts the normal function of the cell. The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs in almost all tumour types and progresses over time with tumorigenicity. The methylation of repeats provides genome stability, and hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats and overall, leads to genome instability. DNA hypomethylation that is observed for repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to activation of oncogenes and initiates chromosome instability. This genome instability leads to insertions and deletions of genes that causes diseases such as cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, genomic imprinting allows certain genes to be expressed based on the parent of origin. For instance, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and prevents the CTCF from binding to the ICR. This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 and expression of Igf2 occurs on the paternal allele while H19 is silenced. On the maternal allele, there is no methylation of ICR and CTCF binds to the ICR, where the enhancers act on H19 and blocks the expression of Igf2. Therefore, Igf2 is silenced on the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted where the paternal allele maintains normal function, however, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, by methylation of ICR which causes Igf2 to be expressed. Both the maternal allele and paternal allele show expression of Igf2 and overexpression of Igf2 occurs and promotes the growth of a tumour in this instance. The alteration in DNA methylation at ICRs can result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes can occur and cause diseases like Wilm's tumour and Beckwith Widerman syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is considered a DNA-demethylating agent where it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor which is a nucleoside analogue. Nucleoside analogues get incorporated into DNA and during replication, when DNMT comes to bind to the DNA and copy the methlyation to the daughter strand, that DNMT is bound irreversibly and con no longer be released. Since action of DNMT inhibitors is division dependent, cells have to be replicating. Cancer cells divide much more rapidly and therefore drugs like Decitabine will severly affect the replication of cancer cells more. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect in that if DNA methylation is inhibited (especially at CpG islands), tumour suppressor genes are no longer silenced and prevent further tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects on the epigenome since changes in DNA methylation can include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This then causes abnormal expression of genes, and since epigenetic changes, like DNA methylation, are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, changes in the epigenome are not erased immediately and changes in DNA methylation can be passed down to future generations if these changes are not erased during epigenetic reprogramming. Epigenetic reprogramming is also known as a sensitive period where there is a clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods of development occur during germ cell development and early embryonic development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. For instance, if a woman is pregnant or trying to get pregnant and having to undergo cancer treatment, medications that have epigenetic changes could be passed on to the embryo since there could be a disruption in epigenetic reprogramming and certain epigenetic marks, like DNA methylation, are not erased during these sensitive periods. </p></div>
