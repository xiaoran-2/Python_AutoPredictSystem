    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CGIs is one of the better studied epidenetic mechanisms. The laying down of methylation marks at CGIs can be associated with either gene silencing or activation (depending on the specific loci sequence / part of the genome) as the CGIs tend to be found at the location of promoters. Usually these CGIs are in an unmethylated state and the promoter is 'active' leading to gene expression. Methylation in the vicinity of the promoters is therefore usually associated with gene silencing and this is a gene regulatory function. </p>
<p>In cancer, the CGIs tend to be hypermethylated (the opposite of what is usually seen in a normal cell) and this effectively silences the associated gene(s). This will frequently be the silencing of a tumour suppression gene which then allows the cancer to proliferate. Similar processes seems to be occurring in the nearby CpG island shores (methylation marks are laid down whereas they are absent in normal genome).</p>
<p>In repetitive regions and the intergenic regions, a pattern of hypomethylation is characteristic of cancer. In normal function, the repeats would be expected to be methylated as these regions of the genome can lead to genetic instability (e.g. undesirable recombinations between chromosomes) so it is important that the repeats are not active. Without the epigenetic methylation, the genome is more likely to suffer some kind of instability (e.g. deletions or insertions, polyploidy) and then these genetic changes may bring about tumourigenesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, in broad terms, both hypermethylation found at specific loci and hypomethylation across the genome can lead to the establishment and progression of cancer. While the exact mechanism varies by type of tumour, hypermethylation is often associated with silencing of tumour suppression genes, while hypomethylation seems to be associated with deleterious genetic changes and possibly activation of oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, there is methylation at the imprint control region for the H19/Igf2 cluster, coupled with methylation at the H19 promoter region. This means that an intermediate called CTCF is not able to bind at this site, resulting in downstream enhancers acting on the Igf2 sequence rather than the H19 sequence. So the paternal Igf2 allele is expressed and the paternal H19 allelle is not expressed.</p>
<p>Normally, the maternal ICR at this locus is not methylated and this permits binding of CTCF at this site. The consequence is that the downstream enhancers act preferentially on H19 and not on Igf2. So, the maternal H19 allele is expressed but the maternal Igf2 allele is silenced.</p>
<p>The disruption that leads to Wilm's tumour is methylation of the maternal ICR and at the H19 locus. This results in a maternal expression pattern that mirrors that of the paternal genes. The result is effectively a double dose of the Igf2 protein being expressed coupled with bilateral repression of H19. It is believed that this leads to cancer due to the bilateral silencing of H19 which is thought to be a tumour suppressor, while the bilateral expression of insulin growth factor 2 leads to upregulation of cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors (aka DNMTi). It's mode of action appears to be inhibition of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase which leads to hypomethylation. The effective dose range for the ideal level of DNA demethylation appears to be relatively low, whereas toxicity is observed at higher doses.</p>
<p>This hypomethylation in tumour cells may lead to reactivation of genes that were silenced by hypermethylation in the cancer process. It is thought that the demethylation leads to expression of previously silenced tumour suppressor genes and / or other genes responsible for control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. Although the pharmaceutical effect is systemic, it appears to be effectively targetting blood borne cancers where there is rapid cell division while sparing non-proliferating cells which are relatively insensitive. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks once laid down are remarkably stable throughout the lifetime of an adult. The enduring nature of this epigenetic mark is becuase DNA methylation is mitotically heritable - the methylation pattern is effectively replicated (via the action of DNMT1) when cells replicate. So if a drug erases these marks or otherwise changes the pattern of DNA methylation, then the resulting set of methylation marks will be inherited by future generations of cells even after the drug therapy is discontinued.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those particular times in the life of an organism when the epigenome undergoes extensive reprogramming such as erasure of previous marks and subsequent laying down of new methylation marks. There are two notable sensitive periods: early embryonic development and during primordial germ cell development. Great caution would be advisable in using drugs that act on the epigenome during these sensitive periods. Evidence from ART studies plus evidence from cloning (somatic cell nuclear transfer) as well as observational epidemiological studies indicate that normal epigenetic reprogramming can be adversely disrupted by exogenous agents. Therefore female patients who have recently conceived would be potentially placing their unborn children at risk by taking drugs that modify methylation. So would children / teenagers in whom the gametes are still developing.</p></div>
