    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression and is important for maintaining genetic stability.</p>
<p>CpG islands have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation and represent regions of tissue specific methylation in normal tissues. However, in cancer cells CpG islands and CpG island shores, tend to become hypermethylated, which causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes in a locus specific manner. These genes have distinct functions in controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, hence, when silenced; the cell can become malignant in accordance with the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>Different types of cancer have distinct hypermethylated locus specific regions. These regions serve as an epigenetic biomarker for many human diseases and can also be used to monitor tumor burden. They also can be used to diagnose cancer and the different patterns of hypermethylated phenotypes are associated with different disease prognoses and responses to therapy.</p>
<p>The methylated cytosines are found in 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. These genomic wide regions correspond to repetitive elements, such as satellites, transposons and intergenic regions that are maintained in a silent state throughout consecutive mitosis by DNA methyltransferases and CpG poor promoters.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation genome-wide in cancer leads to genomic instability due to the activation of repeats that transpose into different regions of the genome and the illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a given therapy relies basically on a context dependent manner. So, given the specific stage of the disease a specific treatment can be more prone to stop the proliferation of the cancer cell or otherwise it would enhance it. The same thing happens when different tumors are involved. Hence, knowing the DNA methylation state of a given disease would contribute for choosing the appropriate treatment under specific conditions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region in the paternal allele is methylated. This mark extends to the adjacent locus of the H19 gene that is also methylated giving the chance to the enhancer located downstream to activate the expression of the Igf2 gene. <br /><br />The imprinting control region in the maternal allele is undermethylated and enables the binding of the CTCF insulator element that allows the enhancers to act on H19 gene wich means that the Ig2 locus will be silenced. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the loss of imprinting causes the hypermethylation of the imprinting control region wich causes the expression of the Igf2 in the maternal allele. </p>
<p>These loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster result in a double dosis of the Igf2 gene in comparison whith what happens in a normal cell. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene associated with Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the <span>DNA-demethylating agents class, thus would generate an hypomethylation response on the epigenome. </span></p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia and would act upon the overmethylation of tumor supressor genes. Associated with some other drugs could help in the effect to slow tumor growth and eventually reverse the malignant state. Although could also help the patient making more suscpetible for standard chemotherapy, the anti-tumour effect would only be effective if the demethylation occurs in a sequence specific manner given that if it demethylates other normally methylated regions could cause more severe genomic instabilities.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome given that the methylation patterns are heritable through generations from one cell to their daughters, thus changing DNA methylation with drug treatments would keep on transmitting the same alterate pattern when the tumour growths.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is that in wich at a specific state of the development of an individual the epigenetic marks suffer a reprogramming in order to give rise to the normal differentiation of specific tissues according to the stablished imprinting regions through the genome. One of this sensitive periods occurs at early stages of the formation of the embryo, at the Blastocist level, and during differentiation of the germinal cells. </p>
<p>Treatment with drugs that alter DNA methylation status during this senstive periods would have an unpredictable consequence on the development of the fetus and the production of gametes by causing changes, not only in the imprinting regions, but also can cause changes in the methylation patterns of normally silenced genes that now become activated, such as the transposable elements that cause genomic instability or otherwise by silencing genes that need to be expressed in order to maintain a stable and healthy cell/individual.  </p></div>
