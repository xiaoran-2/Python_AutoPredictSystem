    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Global hypomethylation and localized CpG promoter hypermethylation characterize most cancers. The hypomethylation of previously silenced regions causes increased genomic instability through the illegitimate recombination of repetitive elements, freedom of transposable elements, and activation of intergenic cryptic promoters for oncogenes in regions that were once heterochromatinized. The level of methylation in CpG islands that flank promoters often inversely correlates with their transcriptional activity; thus, aberrant hypermethylation causes the silencing of active tumor suppressor genes that normally inhibit cell growth. The less common hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters often has down-stream effects that silence tumor suppressor genes. You just lost the game. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting strikes a balance between a father's desire for large offspring and a mother's for smaller offspring and is implicated in genes related to cell growth. When imprinting is disrupted, there is a potential for uncontrolled cell growth and division. For example, aberrant hypermethylation in the Igf2/H19 cluster on the maternal allele will block binding of CTCF, a protein that interferes with enhancer access to the Igf2 gene. Instead of transcribing H19, the maternal allele will mimic that of the father and express Igf2, causing the cell to get a double-dose of growth factor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine homolog that inhibits DNA methyltransferases and thus DNA methylation through irreversible binding. This binding prevents the establishment of repressive methylation in tumor suppressor genes in dividing cells and thus is an effective therapy in malignacies with aberrant hypermethylation patterns.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Our current epigenetic therapies for cancer work through mostly unknown and nonspecific mechanisms, so the downstream effects of drugs that target methylation may be confounded as the source of their effectiveness. The differential expression of genes for lncRNAS, etc. and ensuing changes in histone methylation and nuclear architecture due to differences in DNA methylation can alter the epigenetic landscape. As such, supplying a patient with drugs during periods of epigenetic reprogramming- such as during youth when the primordial germ cells are developing- would not be advisable, as this could have serious implications for the patient's offspring and/or predispose the patient to cancers of the germ line (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_cell_tumor)</p></div>
