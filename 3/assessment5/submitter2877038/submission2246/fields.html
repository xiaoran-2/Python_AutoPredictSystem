    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of CpG islands methylation is to regulate gene expression through silencing. The level of CpG islands methylation increases as the cell progresses towards tumorigenesis. Tumor suppressor genes are those genes responsible for regulating the cell growth and division by inhibiting oncogeneic signals, and it's one of the hallmarks of cancer that those tumor suppressor genes are most likely inactivated. CpG islands hypermethylation is more likely to be found at promotors of these genes, hence silencing their gene expression so the transformed cell could grow indefinitely. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements, on the other hand, are normally hypermethylated, and what happens during the process of tumorigenesis is that they get less methylated as the cell becomes more cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylation agent with an anti-tumoreginec effect. It causes DNA hypomethelation which, in turn, could lead to the re-activation of the tumor suppressor genes, which are hypermethylated in the case of cancer and are, therefore, silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cell have a machinary by which they can maintain de novo DNA methylation throughout the following generations, thus making these changes heritable. These 'lasting' effects should be avoided during the sensitive period of development, which are the two critical periods of epigenetic reprogramming known to happen during embryonic development (in the pre-implantaion stage and during the development of the gonads primordial germ cells). Treating patients with such agents during these critical periods might, therefore, disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming process.</p></div>
