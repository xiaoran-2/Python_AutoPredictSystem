    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancerous cells show global hypomethylation of DNA, but with localised hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands.</p>
<p>CpG islands are commonly found in gene promoter regions, and have a low level of methylation in normal cells. DNA methylation of promoters is a stable form of gene silencing, and hypomethylated promoters can instead be repressed or activated as appropriate by post-translational histone modifications. In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated resulting in repression of genes that would be expressed in normal cells, including tumour suppressing genes.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are normally heavily methylated in all cell types and at all times, even when other epigenetic marks are cleared. This is important to maintain genetic stability by preventing aberrant recombination at repeats, and also acts to silence the strong promoter regions in repeats, which can otherwise cause over-expression of downstream genes. Loss of methylation at these regions causes genetic instability which can result in cancer-promoting mutations, and in some cases oncogenes are over-expressed due to a cryptic promoter upstream which is no longer methylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region is methlyated which prevents the CTFC protein from binding to it. Without CTFC the methylation can also spread to the H19 promoter and silence it. Downstream enhancers are free to act on Igf2, so its product, Insulin-like growth factor 2, is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTFC to bind to it, and H19 also remains hypomethylated. When bound to the ICR, CTFC insulates Igf2 from it's enhancers so it's not expressed. The enhancers instead upregulate H19, which is thought to suppress Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the maternal ICR becomes hypermethylated as in the paternal allele, causing it to express Igf2 instead of H19. This overexpression of growth factor allows the tumour to develop in the embryo. Overexpression of Igf2 caused by loss of imprinting is also found in other embryonic tumours and many other types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an enzymatic inhibitor targeting DNA methyltransfersase. It causes DNMT to permanently bind to CpG sites, so it's unable to continue adding DNA methylation marks to the genome. As the cell divides, DNA methylation is passively lost as the marks are not copied, so daughter cells become hypomethylated. All cells are affected by the drug, but tumour cells disproportionately so because they divide frequently. If a tumour is able to survive because certain tumour suppressors are silenced by DNA methylation, hypomethlyation of the genome will cause those genes to be expressed again. The tumour suppressors can then halt growth and cause the death of the tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark which is usually copied to each newly created DNA strand during mitosis, so that once a mark is established it's inherited by all daughter cells. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes by DNA methylation may lead to cancer, as the cell and all it's daughter cells don't have the same growth limitations as healthy tissue. When methylation is cleared the daughter cells will also have hypomethylated DNA, so the tumour suppressors will remain active unless they become mutated or silenced in some daughter cells.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors can effect any dividing cells in the body, not just tumour cells, and hypomethylation will persist in these cells too. This could result in side effects, especially if administered during epigenetically sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those where epigenetic marks are laid down which are necessary for normal development, and disrupting the process is likely to result in pathology. These are primordial germ cell development in the embryo, germ cell maturation, early embryonic development and to some extent childhood. Inducing hypomethylation during these periods could affect the differentiation of tissues and disrupt the setting of other epigenetic marks such as post-translational histone modifications, which would have lifelong consequences for the patient or their offspring.</p></div>
