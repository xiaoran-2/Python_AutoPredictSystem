    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a molecular process that involves the addition of a methyl group to a <em>cytosine</em> ring. In cancer development, <em>aberrant </em>DNA methylation patterns have been found in two distinct forms<em>: hypomethylation, </em>(decrease in methylation level), and <em>hypermethylation, </em>(increase of methylation level), [1].</p>
<p>A <em>CpG</em> island is a genomic region that contains a high frequency of CG dinucleotides, [2]. While in a normal cell, the CpG islands are unmethylated, in cancer, it is more likely that hypermethylation can be observed at these regions, leading to unscheduled <em>tumour suppressor genes (TSG)</em><strong> </strong>silencing, [1]. In normal conditions, a TGS protects a cell from progression toward uncontrolled growth.  Its activity can be reduced in malignant cells by genetic mutations and/or <em>epigenetic silencing</em>. The inactivation of a TGS leads to cancer because without correct expression of the protein, the abnormal cells will be allowed to divide uncontrolled.</p>
<p>A CpG poor promoter is defined to be a promoter with a low number of CpG islands; normally, these regions are methylated. Hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters can be another marker for tumourgenesis since it can determine proto-oncogene, [1] or microRNA activation. A normal cell contains <em>proto-oncogenes, which can </em>become oncogenes in tumour cells due to mutation or epigenetic <em>activation</em>, allowing cell proliferation, [1]. The effect of microRNA is target-dependent – if the microRNA’s target was a tumour suppressor gene, the microRNA activation will induce silencing of that gene.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the repetitive elements are methylated through the intergenic regions. In cancer, DNA hypomethylation is most-commonly occurring at repetitive elements and intergenic regions, being associated with <em>chromosomal (genomic) instability, </em>[1]<em>.</em>Additionally, methylation can be found also in the genes’ introns. In a cancerous cell, these regions are hypomethylated.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation status of ICRs depends on the ICRs regions and the functions of the genes expressed, and it can be either hypermethylation or hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Considering the case of H19/Igf2, in a normal cell, the ICRs are methylated in paternal allele; because of this, the enhancers act on Igf2, which is further expressed.</p>
<p>In maternal allele of a normal cell, ICRs are unmethylated; consequently, enhancers act on H19, which will be expressed. In this case, Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICRs are found to be methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles. Since ICRs are methylated on maternal allele, Igf2 is also expressed from maternal alleles, leading to double Igf2 dose comparing to a normal cell. In this case and given the fact that Igf2 has a role in growth promoting, the cell will become abnormal.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Decitabine</em> is a DNA-demethylating drug, being used in treatment of <em>myelodysplastic syndromes</em>, a disorder that can evolve to <em>acute myelogenous leukaemia</em>, [1].</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, causing DNA hypomethylation, [1].</p>
<p>It is well-known that the tumour suppressor genes can be aberrantly silenced due to hypermethylation of the CpG islands from their promoters. Therefore, if a DNA-methylation inhibitor, such as <em>decitabine</em>, is applied to these specific regions, it can help re-establishing the normal methylation patterns. Consequently, the tumour suppressor genes, which have been abnormally silenced due to hypermethylation, will be correctly re-expressed and the normal cell cycle will be reactivated.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant changes in DNA methylation patterns can cause abnormal expression of cancer-related genes. Sometimes, epigenetic mechanisms are reversible, [1] and in the last years, many studies have been dedicated to the development of epigenetics drugs, which seem to have a high potential for being used in cancer treatment, [2]. However, the usage of epigenetic drugs is still in an incipient phase since not all side-effects of changing the epigenetic markers are well-known.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the modifications from environment have a high influence on epigenetic control. The periods of sensitive development are the following:</p>
<ol><li>the first one is between the period of primordial germ cells to the production of mature egg and sperm;</li>
<li>the second one is between pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods.</li>
</ol><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would not be advisable because any environmental change made during these periods have a high influence on epigenetic makeup. In these cases, the drugs could have harmful effects on the tissue/body.</p>
