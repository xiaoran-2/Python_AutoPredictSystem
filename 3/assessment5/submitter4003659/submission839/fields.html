    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs basically in CpG dinucleotides, and when found on promoter regions it, generally, inversely correlates with gene expression. The exception being CpG islands, which are found in 60% of promoters, yet, in normal situations, tend to be hypomethylated. In cancer, these CpG islands are commonly hypermethylated, especially in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation and the consequent epigenetic silencing of the tumor suppressor genes, may be one of the hits to the DNA necessary for the development of cancer.</p>
<p>But CpG islands are an exception, the vast majority of the genome is made of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. And in normal cells the CpG dinucleotides in those regions are typically methylated. In contrast, in a cancer cell, there’s a genome wide hypomethylation. Happens early, it’s a general rule, and, as CpG hypermethylation, progresses with time.</p>
<p>These hypomethylation is more common on repeats, and it is there where it’s more important. In normal cells, repeats elements are methylated and are packaged down to heterochromatin; so, even when they are identical in sequence, they cannot recombine. In cancer, the absence of methylation leads to an open chromatin which in turn leads to genomic instability (by permitting illegitimate recombination between repeats, and by activating the repeats and allowing them to transpose and to disrupt neighbor genes, and also by activating cryptic promoters of neighbor genes), and which enhance tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most of the imprinted genes are involved in growth (either promoting or suppressing it), so disruption of imprinting could contribute to cancer. This disruption may be by hypo or hyper methylation, depending of the context. In the case of the H19/Ifg2 cluster what we have is a hypermethylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell what we have is a ICR methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. When it’s unmethylated the CTCF insulator can bind and then the enhancers act upon the H19 gene, and the Igf2 is not expressed; but in the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind because the ICR in methylated so that the Igf2 is expressed, and H19 silenced.</p>
<p>What happen in cancer is that the ICR is hypermethylated in both alleles, so that the maternal allele no longer expresses  H19, and instead expresses Igf2, so that the cell have now a double douse of Igf2 and none of H19. And as Igf2 is a growth promoter this is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that that target enzymatic epigenetic regulator, specifically it is a DNMT inhibitor, which is FDA approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).</p>
<p>This kind of DNA-demethylating agents work because they are nucleoside analogs so they get incorporated into DNA upon replication and when the DNMT1 binds that nucleotide in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it gets irreversible bound.   </p>
<p>This drugs are division dependent, and as cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than normal cells, they are also much more affected. If used is high doses they are toxic, but when used in small doses they have an anti-neoplastic affect.</p>
<p>Although it’s not completely clear why they work so well only in myelodysplastic syndromes, it could be because myelodysplastic syndromes might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable, and they are so until they are actively erased, and that’s why the effects of the drug that alter them may last beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>In the particular case of altering DNA methylation, for instance by using DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi), it can have long term effects because every cells divide in some moment (so this applies not only to cancer). As DNMTi are not selective, so that every cell would be affected, it is import that these drugs won’t be taken during sensitive periods (i.e. periods of development where epigenetic reprograming occurs: during germ cell development and in early embryonic development) because inhibiting the epigenetic machinery would be a huge insult during those periods.</p></div>
