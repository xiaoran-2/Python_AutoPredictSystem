    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a healthy cell, the CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation because that is the place where specific promoters bound to transcription factors and begin with gene expression, and also is the place where the tumor suppressor genes are found. On the other hand, in a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated causing as a consequence the silencing of specific genes because the transcription factors no longer can attach to the promoter region and more important lead the silencing of the tumor suppressors genes. This process is called DNA hypermethylation and is one of the insults that can originate a tumor and as a consequence cancer.  </p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are different in normal and in cancer cells. In a normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated which contribute to genomic stability. Methylations in these places maintain the silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and also to prevent illegitimate recombination. On the contrary, in a cell cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are non methylated, these is called DNA hypomethylation process, and is more commonly found in the repetitive elements. The consequences of hypomethylation are a complete series of deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions that leads to genomic instability. For instance, in mouse models, hypomethylation due to deletion of Dnmt1 in some tissues increases genomic instability that leads to cancer. In humans, it has been observed mutations in DNMT3B resulting in genomic instability as well. In addition, hypomethylation leads to the activation of poor promoters which can result in activation of unwanted genes, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is presented in cancer when the two alleles, father and mother, are expressed or silent. Given that the majority of imprinting genes are involved in growth promoters or growth suppressing, the lost of imprinting can produce specific diseases.</p>
<p> In cluster H19/Igf2, the paternal allele is imprinted in the imprinted zone and shows DNA methylation. This methylation blocks the union of the protein CTCF to the imprinted zone, as a consequence the enhancer is free to act on the Igf2 and promote its expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the imprinted zone of the maternal allele is unmethylated and it leads the bound of the protein CTCF, an insulator protein. This union insulates the link between enhancers with Igf2 and no expression is produced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the disruption follows when there is an overexpression of Igf2 which is an oncogen. The methylation in both alleles causes that the mother allele acts as the father. Hence, there are double dose of Igf2 in compared with the behavior of a normal cell. Given that Igf2 is a growth promoter, the over dose developed Wilm’s tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors which are characterised by inhibit the activity of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes. This means that the treatment with Decitabine can decrease the disruption that leads cancer due to the inhibition of DNA methylation.  The lack of epigenetic marks, mehtylation, can establish some of the disruptions in DNA and as a consequence reduce the disease and lead to a normal tissue. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According with the mention of Dr Stephen Baylin it is possible that DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment, because epigenetic drugs act on DNA methylation inhibiting its function. This change is mitotically heritable, therefore, after many cell replications, the epigenetic therapy changes can decrease the growing of the cancer tumor. At the end the cancer cells have the modification that enduring on the epigenome until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are called because is the time when the epigenetic reprogram occur. The two important sensitive periods are presented during gestation. The first period is during early embryonic development, between fertilisation and blastocyst; and the second period is during primordial germ development. These sensitive periods are really important for a health development in a person, because all the epigenetic landmarks are setting in the DNA in those specific periods of time. Therefore, if there is interference during these periods, the consequences would be a series of modification and disruptions in the DNA which can trigger the expression or silencing important genes, transcription factors or growth promoters. For example, Angelman syndrome and Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome might be the result to imprinting disorders in ART children. </p></div>
