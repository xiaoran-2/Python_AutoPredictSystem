    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells there is a pattern of DNA methylation that is critical in the development and maintenance of cells.  High density regions of CpG that are methylated may lead to the silencing of a specific gene.  When these sites are undermethylated the gene that was once silenced gets promoted and expressed.  This is what may be happening in some types of cancers.  In other cancers or diseases there may be regions that were not methylated under normal conditions that get hypermethylated thus silencing a gene that was supposed to maintain normal cell functions. Aberrant methylation patterns may lead to the turning on or off of a gene that may cause a variety of symptoms several of which may be cancerous.  Similarly other areas of the genome such as intergenic regions or areas with repetitive elements may be normally methylated or unmethylated.  Since these regions play a role in the normal functioning of the cell their disruption could cause a variety of symptoms or lead to cancer.  The change in methylation may have a direct affect on a gene promoter or may affect another pre-curser that will then affect a gene promoter.</p>

<p>For all questions I referred to notes taken during the course as well as the printed material that was required for reading.  In addition I also referred to the text "Epigenetics", Allis, Jenuwein and Reinberg, Cold Spring Harbor Labratory Press, copy right 2007, mostly referring to chapters 19 and 21</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal and paternal alleles are differentially expressed.  During imprinting the paternal allele prevents the CTCF protein from binding at the imprinted control region (ICR) by methylation at the ICR.  Because of this a shared enhancer prevents the expression of H19 and instead activates the Igf2 cluster.  In the material allele the ICR is not methylated and so CTCF can bind to it.  This causes the enhancer to activate H19 instead of Igf2.  In some types of diseases including the development of Wilm’s tumors the maternal allele also gets methylated.  This causes biallelic expression of Igf2.  This increases the production of the growth promoting Igf2 protein leading to excessive growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent sold under the name Dacogen by the Japanese company Eisai.  It is currently being used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which is the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  In some cases of cancer there is an overmethylation along the epigenome.  This overmethylation may cause the silencing of genes including “tumour-suppressor” genes.  Since these genes stop uncontrolled cell growth if they are silenced cancer may develop.  Drugs like Decitabine can remove some of the methylation which may reset the “tumour-suppressor” genes allowing that gene to keep unregulated growth from happening.  If the methylation patterns then return to normal and the daughter cells maintain the balanced methylation pattern the cells should no longer be cancerous.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be passed on during cell division, so by altering DNA methylation you can change the DNA methylation pattern for all future daughter cells.  Sensitive periods are where the epigenome is more susceptible to changes in its environment.  During these susceptible time the epigenome is erased and getting reprogramed.   Lack of certain nutrients or exposure to toxins has a higher chance of altering the epigenome during these times.  One of the sensitive periods is just after fertilization when the zygote has undergone only a few cell divisions and another is when a fetus is developing the primordial germ cells.  It also appears that during pre-adolescence there is a sensitive period that may affect the maturing germ cells of those children.   During these sensitive periods methylation patterns and other epigenetic patterns are being reprogrammed.  If a drug treatment were to greatly change methylation patterns then the germ cells may be so altered that there could be sever medical consequences for children or grandchildren of those patients.  It would be best to avoid these types of drug treatments during these sensitive times.</p></div>
