    <div class="field-value"><p>There is close link in between DNA methylation and cancer. DNA methylation patterns undergo alterations in cancer. For example genome wide hypomethylation. On the other hand the CG nucleotide clusters, the so-called CpG islands, are hypermethylated in a locus-specific manner in cancer.</p>
<p>To have a close up on hypermethylation, it’s known that in order to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer, either a genetic mutation or as an alternative elevated DNA methylation at CpG islands occurs. The latter case leads to the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor genes, which favors the progression of cancer.</p>
<p>Apart from CpG islands, though intergenic regions are methylated in normal cells they undergo hypomethylation in cancer cells leading to loss of genomic stability. Like intergenic regions, repetitive elements are also known to be methylated in cancer. As a result of this there is loss in the maintenance of genomic stability. In addition to this, because these elements are no longer silenced transpositions and illegitimate recombinations are not prevented. This may add on to possible mutations occurred and aggravate cancerous cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Common feature of cancer is loss of imprinting. This means that instead of having monoallelic expression of a gene (either from maternal or paternal copy), the gene is either expressed from both allele or not expressed from neither of the alleles, being completely silent. Additionally, methylation status of the imprint control regions (ICRs) defines the expression pattern many genes. One example to this is the H19/Igf2 cluster, which is tightly regulated by methylation.</p>
<p>In the case of maternal allele, ICR is not methylated and thus the insulator element CTCF binds to ICR; enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 gene becomes silent.</p>
<p>In the case of paternal allele, ICR is hypermethylated, therefore CTCF cannot bind, blocking enhancer accessibility and this leads to active Igf2 expression. With loss of imprinting the maternal ICR is also hypermethylated leading to double expression of Igf2 gene from both alleles. Since this gene is growth promoting, this is associated with Wilm’s tumour, which is a childhood kidney tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In order to treat cancer, recent researches highlight the possibility of epigenetic modifiers to be used as drugs. One way to interfere with the proliferation of the cancerous cells is to inhibit the DNA methylation. These drugs act as DNA-demethylating agents and one example to this is the decitabine. The mechanism of action of this drug is to interfere with DNA methylation and reduce methylation in cancer cells. Drug is currently under human trials and expected to be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The speculation that Dr. Baylin has made is lying on the trans generational effect of epigenomic changes. This means that once the epigenetic marks are created or epigenetic changes occur, they can pass onto new generations via cell division. Effect of such drugs endures until the granddaughter cells all lack that specific epigenetic modification that the drug has targeted. Once they are erased from the epigenome, they will not return and by this way without killing all cancerous cells, the tumor size will be under control; there will be no growth of cancer anymore. However care should be given not to apply the drug treatment to the patient during the so-called ‘sensitive periods’. One sensitive period, which would be the concern here regarding drug treatment, is during the slow growth period where there is still germ cell maturation occurring. This period is 9-12 years of age for boys and 8-10 years for girls. During sensitive periods, epigenome is being actively remodeled meaning epigenetic marks are removed or established, rendering it to be susceptible to changes in the environment. Concern is that drug treatment may result in the epigenetic alterations which may be transgenerationally inherited through the gametes.</p></div>
