    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, methylation of DNA occurs in specific areas in the genome that serves important functions. One area of the genome that can be methylated is the so-called CpG (cytosine-guanine) islands. These islands are usually found in gene promoters which are regions in the genome where cellular transcription machinery attaches and initiates transcription of the gene that it controls. Methylation of these CpG islands are associated with inhibition of gene transcription. Another area of the genome where DNA methylation is observed are the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation of these areas help maintain genetic stability so as aberrant deletion, insertions and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes may not take place.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, the pattern of DNA methylation is altered such that it recripocates the pattern found in normal cell. The CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes (that is, genes that suppresses growth) are more likely to be HYPERmethylated. Consequently, these tumor suppressor genes are silenced which can lead to uncontrolled tumor proliferation. On the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer are found to be HYPOmethylated which contributes to genetic instability leading to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations that can potentiate tumor genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster includes (from downstream to upstream): Igf2 gene, imprinting control region (ICR), H19 gene and enhancer region. This gene cluster is normally paternally imprinted wherein the paternal allele's ICR is methylated. This methylation spreads to the adjacent H19 gene promoter leading to H19 silencing and also inhibits binding of an insulator protein called CTCF. As a result, the enhancers are able to interact with and promote transcription of Igf2 (an oncogene that encodes a growth promoter factor). Thus, Igf2 expression is contributed by the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In contrast, the normal maternal allele has unmethylated ICR enabling binding of the insulator CTCF. This binding of CTCF inhibits interaction of the enhancers with Igf2 genes but stimulates enhancer interaction with H19 leading to H19 gene transcription. Thus, H19 expression is contributed by the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor (a childhood kidney cancer), it was observed that the maternal ICR is also methylated and thus behaves like a paternal allele. This leads to a decreased expression of H19 and an increased expression of Igf2. Patients with these epigenetic alteration have double doses of the growth promoter gene Igf2 and therefore contributes to uncontrolled tumor proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes including acute myeloid leukemia. These hematologic malignant conditions are associated with aberrant DNA methylation in gene promoters of tumor suppressor genes leading to its silencing. By inhibiting the enzyme that methylates DNA, decitabine is able to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes by hypomethylating their gene promoters. This reactivation may in turn help in decreasing or slowing tumor proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) happens during &amp; immediately after cell replication so that daughter cells will have the same epigenetic markers as the parental cell. These epigenetic marks are conservatively maintained throughout life except during gametogenesis and post-fertilization where reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs. In these periods, reprogramming is essential for primordial germ cell to be able to form gametes without deactivated genes (as in gametogenesis) and for the zygote to be able to give rise to a pluripotent embryonic cell (as in post-fertilization). For these reasons, these periods are very sensitive to any changes in the DNA de/methylation process.</p>
<p>Altering DNA methylation, by irreversibly inhibiting DNMT as in the case of decitabine for example, thus will not only exert its effect on a parent cell but also to its future daughter cells as this epigenetic mark patterns is conserved throughout generations. This may partly explain why DNMT inhibitors may have anti-tumor effects that last beyond its treatment period. For the same mechanism, it is inadvisable to use these inhibitors during the sensitive periods mentioned above because it may disrupt the proper development of gametes and embryo in such a way that the supposedly methylated and consequently silenced genes (e.g. repetitive elements) are not silenced and can caused genetic instability.</p></div>
