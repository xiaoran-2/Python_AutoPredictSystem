    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although most CpG islands are unmethylated in somatic cells, some CpG islands in some promoters are normally methylated in healthy cells in order to achieve long term transcriptional silencing, such as that found in X chromosome inactivation and in imprinted genes.  In cancer, normally unmethylated CpG islands can become hypermethylated, leading to deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of underlying genes, such as tumor suppressor genes. </p>
<p>In contrast, intragenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated to prevent chromosomal instability by silencing non-coding DNA and transposable DNA elements.  Alternatively, this hypermethylation can provide binding sites for methyl-binding domain proteins, which can mediate gene repression through interactions with histone deacetylases.  In cancer there is hypomethylation, primarily in the repetitive regions.  The chromosomes are less densely packaged, leading to increased opportunity for recombination, activation of noncoding DNA, and movement and/or copying of transposable elements, all increasing the chance of mutation events.</p>
<p>Either silencing of tumor suppressor genes due to hypermethylation at CpG islands or mutation events creating or activating oncogenes due to hypomethylation in repetitive regions could be some of the 'hits' required for cancer development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 gene cluster is paternally imprinted because the DNA methylation is only on the paternal allele.  On the paternal allele, the imprint control region for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated.  This inhibits H19 expression and allows the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression.  The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, so the CTCF insulator protein can bind to it.  This allows H19 long coding RNA expression from the maternal allele;  the enhancers find the ICR blocked by CTCF so instead of promoting Igf2 expression they loop to H19 to enhance its expression.</p>
<p> The majority of Wilm’s tumors appear to have a bipaternal epigenotype with H19 inactive and 1gf2 biallelically active;  there is selective loss of the maternal and reduplication of the paternal chromosome.  Igf2 is an oncogene promoting cell growth;  if you lose the maternal allele, you have too much fetal growth factor (which is why Wilm’s tumor is found typically in young children) and not enough Cdkn1c or H19, which acts as a tumor suppressor gene by down regulating cellular proliferation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  By removing the hypermethylation in CpG islands, suppressed tumor suppressor genes might be activated.  In addition, tumors accumulate DNA methylation during tumor progression, and a DNA demethylating agent could inhibit or slow tumor progression.  Decitabine may also alter tumor cells to make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapies. </p>
<p>If tumor is driven by hypermethylation then decitabine could suppress tumor development but if driven by chromosomal instability then inhibiting methylation could have the opposite effect.  The effect of Decitabine or any other demethylating agent may also depend on the stage of the tumor - the same drug could be ineffective or harmful at one stage of tumor development and beneficial at a different stage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, thus enduring in the epigenome.  For example, a drug that alters DNA methylation patterns to block the expression of genes that allow tumor cells to resist a chemotherapeutic agent would make the tumor more receptive to standard chemotherapy even as the tumor cells divide and the tumor grows.  One would not want to administer a drug that effects the epigenome during a sensitive period; a time in the life of an organism where the epigenome is removed and reprogrammed;  these periods are during gamete formation and right after fertilization.  The epigenome, including DNA methylation patterns, is laid down at this time, and if the patient were given an epigenetic drug during this period, the epigenome would not be programmed properly, leading to harmful effects on the genome, perhaps even those incompatible with life.</p></div>
