    <div class="field-value">As DNA methylation is described the transformation of a cytosine to 5-methyl-cytosine. This alteration is laid down by de novo methyltransferases 3a and 3b in humans (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) while its mitotic heritability is reassured by dnmt1, a methyltransferase that recognizes specifically hemi-methylated DNA. It is essential for life, as DMNT knockouts die in utero.
DNA methylation can occur in three DNA regions: CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.
As far as CpG islands are concerned, these regions tend to be protected from DNA methylation unless if silencing of a gene expression is involved. It is globally known that methylation of a CpG island leads to silencing of the expression of specific genes. A widely known example of the results of DNA methylation on CpG islands is the inactivation of the X chromosome. DNA methylation at CpG islands generally involves the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and in some particular cases (CpG poor promoters) prohibits factor binding and alters gene expression.
In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, in order to achieve silencing of tumour supressor genes. CGI hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumours and is mitotically heritable. This disruption contributes to disease in many aspects. First of all, a silecing of one or more tumor supressor genes, leads to an uncontroled rate of cell division, a situation generally connected to tumour growth. This fact along with the mitotic heritability of these epigenetic marks, enhance the invasion of tumours.
Furthermore, CGI hypermethylation can be used as a diagnostic feature in cancer (identify the tumour type/sub-type or which is the primary tumour), since the disruption varies by tumour type and progresses with time. It can be also used prognostically and for monitoring the evolution of the disease, through detection of cells or tumour DNA in the blood as free cell DNA. 
DNA methylation in intergenic regions and/or repetitive elements has a completely different function in normal as well as in cancer cells.
In the first case, DNA methylation is really frequent and helps in maintaining the genomic integrity by avoiding genomic instability phenomena such as deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions of parts of the DNA. Additionally, DNA methylation in intergenic regions is also responsible for silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites whereas in repetitive elements it prevents interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination.
In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated and this disruption occurs in some degree in all tumours. It results in genomic instability which is firstly expressed through illegitimate recombination between the repetitive elements, since the cancer cells are rapidly divided and DNA is not densely packaged as heterochromatin. 
Its contribution to disease is associated with the activation of repeats and traspositions of DNA, which lead to disruption of neighbouring genes and their expression. It is also associated with the activation of cryptic promoters that were silenced and may cause differences in DNA transcrition and gene expression. 
The above let us consider the possible effectiveness of epigenetic therapy in cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Imprint is associated with DNA methylation and imprinted genes exist in clusters, each one of which has its own Imprint Control Region (ICR). Many of them are involved in growth and the loss of imprinting seems to be a common feature in cancer and its contribution to disease can be described via the example of  H19/Igf2 cluster.
H19/Igf2 is a cluster of imprinted genes and, as mentioned above, it has its own ICR. In this case, the ICR is paternally imprinted, the DNA methylation of ICR differs between the two alleles and H19, the area producing a long non-coding RNA, seems to be very important for this cluster of genes but not for the establishment of imprinting. A more detailed description of the two alleles is fournished below.
On one hand, the ICR is not methylated in the maternal allele. This allows to CTCF, an insulator protein, to bind on it. The presence of this protein does not let the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2. As a result, Igf2 is not from the maternal allele while the enhancers act on H19 and enhance its expression instead.
On the other hand, the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and this means that there is no protein binding on it. As a result, in the absence of CTCF the enhancers are allowed to act on Igf2 and promote its expression from the paternal allele. Additionally, DNA methylation spreads from ICR to the neighbouring promoter of H19 and the gene silenced for this allele.
In the case of Wilm's tumour, the aforementioned imprinting pattern is lost. A DNA hypermethylation occurs in ICR and CTCF protein does no longer bind on it in the maternal allele. This disruption results in the expression of Igf2 in both alleles and the complete silencing of H19, since its promoter is found to be methylated in both alleles too.
Igf2 is considered to be an oncogene, a growth promoting gene and the overexpression observed in this childhood kidney tumour can certainly be related to the disease and contribute toits evolution.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia (“Cancer’s epicentre”, The Economist).
Decitabine belongs to the class of the DNMT1 inhibitors. This means that it is involved in the modification of DNA methylation, although its mechanism of action is yet unclarified. Those drugs are, in general, nucleoside analogues and a possible explanation for their impact on DNA methylation is their incorporation to the genome upon replication. After that, due to their structural differences from nucleosides, the binding of DNMT on them in order to transfer the “information” of methylation to daughter DNA strands during cell division, is irreversable. So, a DNA demethylation would occur. Such a result would lead to the removal of the epigenetic mark of this methylation in all the daughter cells, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. 
As it is obvious from the above description, the activity of a drug like Decitabicine is strictly related to the process of cell replication and can be established to any kind of cell. For this reason, high doses of these drugs were toxic and the result non-speicific.
But in lower doses, an anti-tumour effect can be attributed to them, based on the characteristics of their mode of action. Because as it is mentioned before, their activity is expressed only during cell division and cancer cells are constanlty and rapidly replicating. This means that they are also the most susceptible cells to the results of drugs like Decitabicine.
Additionally, DNA hypermethylation causes offently silencing of tumour supressor genes and this results in tumour growth. A possible demethylation in these cells could also lead re-activation of the silenced genes and re-establishment of their activity.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to the presence in the cells of DNMT1, an enzyme  that recognizes specifically hemi-methylated DNA. This methyltransferase is responsible for the maintenace of the methylation epigenetic marks that were established during sensitive periods and their trasfer to the daughter cells during division mainly of somatic cells.
Via this specific mechanism of maintenance can any alterations in DNA methylation have enduring effects on the epigenome.
Although, there are some specific periods, called the sensitive periods, during which the epigenetic marks are not maintained but erased. These are the periods of active reprogramming in the life of a person where DNA demethylation occurs and is followed by establishment of new epigeetic marks through a de novo methylation procedure.
As sensitive periods of development are considered, as described above, the periods of active reprogramming. Those are the early embryonic development, where the demethylation of the whole parental genome happens and theepigenetic marks are re-established after implantation, and the development of primordial germ cells, during which a somatic cell is fully demethylated and is then reset in order to produce mature sperms or oocytes. This period is found during midgestation and is there that ICR methylation is also established, in order to achieve parent-of-origin specific marks.
There are also more -and differnt- sensitive periods for each tissue specifically but they are not considered neither as sensitive nor as important for the whole organism, as the aforementioned.
It is though iminent that treating of patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods would be unadvisable. Since at this time the whole genome is demethylated and the epigenetic marks are reset, the contribution of factors that have the ability to modify them irreversably would be out of control or prediction. If, for instanse, a drug that inhibits the activity of DNMT1 was given to a person during a sensitive period, this would lead perhaps to hypomethylation of its genome and, consequently, to alterations in gene expression and genomic stability.</div>
