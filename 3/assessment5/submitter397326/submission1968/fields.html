    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells have hypomethylated CpG islands and the methylated repetitive elements, intergenic regions as well as introns of gene. In contrast, the cancer cells have hypermethylated CpG islands and hypomethylated DNA in the rest of the genome. DNA methylation at CpG is used as a mechanism to silence tumor suppressor genes. It can be disrupted because epimutation is reversible.</p>
<p>Normal cells use methylation of promoters as predictor of gene expression. Hypermethylated promoter means that the gene is less likely to be expressed. Gene body (intergenic regions, repetitive elements) methylation is present in highly expressed cells, and is thought to be repressing alternative transcription start sites. Disruption of gene body demethylation and CpG methylation occur over time and in some hematopoietic progenitors. This will  lead to silencing of tumor supressor gene and promote cancer/tumor progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylated pattern of the paternal allele results in the binding of enhancers to Igf2 (in the absence of CTCF binding to the insulator), which leads the expression of Igf2. Unmethylated pattern of the maternal allele results in the binding of CTCF to insulator, which leads to the expression H19 and the silencing of lgf2 because the enhancers will bind H19 promoter and not Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is also methylated so it will also express Igf2, which double the doses of Igf2 in comparison to that of normal cells. Igf2 is growth-promoting and thus associated with Wilm's tumour. Hypermethylation of imprinting control region thus results in loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent, which can prevent hypermethylation of CpG and reverse the effect of CpG hypermethylation on gene expression. Since CpG hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor expression, the reversion of methylation can activate tumor suppressor genes, which leads to tumor regression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have a lasting effects on the epigenome because it returns the methylation state of cancer cells to that of normal cells. Demethylation of gene body and hypermethylation of CpG occur with aging so once DNA methylation is reversed in cancer cells, it cannot be altered rapidly beyond the treatment period. The sensitive period includes the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisible because the cells are most sensitive to epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) during that time. The effect of the de-methylating drug can be reverse quickly if treated during this period</p></div>
