    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are strands of DNA which contain large amount cytosine and guanine residues. Usually CpG islands are situated at the promoter regions of growth suppressor genes, and normally they are not methylated and so the controlled genes are expressed. In cancer, these islands and their shores are generally more methylated than normal. This leads to lack of growth suppressing proteins, which leads to unregulated growth of cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in normal situations methylated. This helps to keep the genome stabile, as the DNA stays heterochromatized and the genes are silenced. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally hypomethylated. This can cause oncogenes become active and increases genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region of paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, and Igf2 expression is active, while H19 expression is silenced. The maternal imprinting control region is unmethylated, which leads to silencing of Igf2 and active expression of H19. In Wilm’s tumour both alleles are methylated like the paternal allele. This leads to increased expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19. Overexpression of Igf2 causes increased cell growth and the loss of H19 adds to it, as H19 normally functions as growth suppressor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which normally methylates DNA. When this enzyme is inhibited, the DNA becomes hypomethylated. The exact pharmacological function of decitabine is not clear, but DNA hypomethylation could lead to activation of tumor suppressor genes, induction of differentiation or aging of cells, which leads to apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike traditional cancer drugs, which target only the cancer cells present, epigenetic cancer drugs can alter the epigenetic state of cancer cells. This epigenetic state is also inherited to the daughter cells, which means epigenetic drugs also target the future cancer cells. For example, DNA methylation status is mitotically heritable and it is possible to alter it with drugs. DNA methylation state can also have affect the efficacy of other cancer drugs, and can lead to their increased potency.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development refer to those times of development, when environmental factors have the most effect on development. Then the epigenetic states of the cells are changing. Sensitive periods happen in the fetal development and at puberty, when the gametes are maturing. Treating patients at puberty could significantly alter the epigenetic state of their cells causing possible infertility issues. Giving cancer drugs to pregnant women in any situation is also a bad idea, as they inhibit cell growth, which is important for fetal development.</p></div>
