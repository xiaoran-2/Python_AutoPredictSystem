    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation provides a stable epigenetic mark and almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals where its symmetry allows its conservation through cell division. <br />Its normal function at CpG islands is to silence gene (CpG islands, i.e. clusters of CpG, are usually at promoters of genes and unmethylated); there are two ways of silencing the first one by having meCpG in a CpG island associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure via binding proteins and the second one, rarer, by having meCpG prohibiting transcription factor binding, and altering gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is altered, at one side there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes and at the other Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters; hypermethylation silence tumour suppressor genes and mitotical heritability of the DNA methylation keeps this defect alive in the dividing cells; hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, not very common, can result in activation of genes targeting tumour suppressor.</p>
<p>These part of the DNA (intergenic regions, repetitive elements) are usually methylated. Maintain genomic integrity is probably the normal function of DNA in intergenic regions for instance by silencing cryptic splice sites. It is more affirmatively the normal function in repetitive elements with mechanims such as: silencing or mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition; silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters; methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.<br />Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals favours genomic instability with:  illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes . It is more common than the CpG poor promoters' hypomethylation.<br />As said above the mitotical heritability of the DNA methylation keeps these defects alive in the dividing cells and so the treatments of tumours are propagated. It is to be noted that effect of DNA methylation depletion can be stage specific (i.e. early vs late in tumorigenesis).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMT inhibitors. It targets Myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML disease.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is very dosis dependant, there is a peak of DNA demethylation at weak dosis and high dosis is very toxic.</p>
<p>So the anti tumour effect can take place at weak dosis playing at phis peak of demethylation with the fast replicating tempo of cancer cells.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main role with this H19/Igf2 cluster is taken by the binding(or not) of an insulator protein CTCF, that insulates(or not) Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes is paternally imprinted (methylated on the paternal allele).<br />H19, a long noncoding RNA, is not active on the paternal allele because it is methylated. So, there is no insulator action and the enhancers can promote Igf2's expression from the paternal allele. There are two steps:first DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding, then without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, there is no methylation upon H19 and the locus of protein CTCF binding, so Igf2 is insulated from downstream enhancers and there is no Igf2's expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour we have the maternal allele which has the same methylation on the H19/Igf2 cluster as the paternal allele, so there is no more maternal silencing of Igf2's expression and a subsequent global Igf2 overexpression. Phenotype appears in embryonic or childhood tumours but interestingly not in adult tumors.<br />Lgf2 overexpression implies overexpression of growth promoting genes that is source of disease.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because of the nature of the epigenome (mitotical heritatibility).</p>
<p>Sensitive periods cover almost all the periods, but the somatic maintenance is almost kept out as less sensitive.There are the periods during which altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>Explicitely in the development, it contains the reprogramming of the primordial germ cells and the erasing/reprogramming of the cell(s) from the zygote to the embryo.</p>
<p>Treating patients during the development can cause imprinting disorders, early embryonic lethality, placental insufficiency, germ cell tumours, tumorigenesis in blood cell development, blocks in<br />differentiation and infertility to name the main ones.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div>
