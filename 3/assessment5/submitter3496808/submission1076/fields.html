    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually located around promoters of genes. If they are not methylated the cell expresses the gene and when they are methylated the gene expression is suppressed.</p>
<p>Allowing the expression of an oncogene or inactivating a tumour suppressor we can end up with a cancer.</p>
<p>Looking at the level of methylation in the progress from a normal tissue through a metastatic tissue we can see that the global level of methylation decreases while the methylation at some CPG islands becomes denser.</p>
<p>In a normal cell we don’t see methylation in general at CpG islands but we find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements, through the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell and the rest of the genome including the three parts mentioned before are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>The CpG islands are usually found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so DNA methylation in these regions is an alternative to genetic mutation for silence these genes. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes is one of the hits that occur in order to have a cancer.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity or stability.</p>
<p>In the case of intergenic regions, it’s been shown that cells with no Dnmt1 display genomic instability and so they can suffer deletions, reciprocal translocations, duplications or insertions. Methylation in these regions also plays some silencing role.</p>
<p>The silencing of repeats helps to prevent transposition that would cause problems at the rest of the genome genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these regions of the genome are hypomethylated, so the genomic stability gets compromised contributing to the possibility of developing a cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The cluster H19/Igf2 is found on human chromosome 11 and it’s controlled by enhancer blocking. </span></p>
<p>Protein CTCF can only bind to the imprinted control region fo this cluster if it’s unmethylated. The binding of CTCF insulates Igf2 from the enhancers that will this way be free to interact with  H19 and enhance it’s expression as we see in the maternal allele, where the region is unmethylated. If CTFC can not bind because of the methylation of the imprinted control region, the Igf2 won’t be insulated and the enhancers will interact and enhance it’s expression as we can see in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene (promotes growth). When H19/Igf2 is disrupted we have effectively appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of the maternal like allele so we’ll have too much Igf2 and no Cdkn1c expression resulting in overgrowth and predisposition to embryonic and childhood but not adult tumours.</p>
<p>The loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of the suppressor genes because of the loss of imprinting is a common feature in general cancer. Many imprinted genes are involved in controlling growth and loss of imprinting being actually a hallmark of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It’s a hypomethylating agent that inhibits DNA methyltransferase and is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to myeloid leukemia or AML.</p>
<p>This drug demethylates or interferes with the methylation of DNA and helps restoring the normal function of the tumour suppressor genes and restoring control over cell growth.<strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">This type of inhibitors are analogues to nucleotides so they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strain, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent. Cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body so these ill cells will be more severely affected by this drug because they’re replicating more</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation can alter gene expression because can reactivate epigenetically silenced genes and restore normal gene function. It is believed that epigenetic gene inactivation is at least as common as mutational events in the development of cancer.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">A sensitive period is when a change in environment can affect more tot the epigenetic control. Not all phases of development can be affected by a change in the environment. This sensitive periods match the two phases of epigenetic reprogramming, that are the moments when methylation decreases. The first is during pre-implantation development, and the second is during primordial germ cell development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During those sensitive periods are really important every change that is made because it will affect the whole future individual. </span></p></div>
