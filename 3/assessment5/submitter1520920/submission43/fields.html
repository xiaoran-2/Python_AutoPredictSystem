    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, in normal cells, the CpG islands are not methylated or are hypomethylated. Because the CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the unmethylated CpG islands do not silence the tumor suppressor genes, thereby tending to suppress cancer.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, and inactivate the tumor suppressor genes. Further, because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this epigenetic silencing tends to be locked down. Cells with this epimutation have a competitive advantage and divide faster or do not die as much.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and in repeats contributes to genomic stability. In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation and the result is genomic instability, including illegitimate recombination between repeats, deletions, insertions, activation of promoters of repeats, reciprocal translocations. Genomic instability can generally promote cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations of DNA methylation  at ICRs (hypo or hyper) can result in loss of expression of growth-restricting genes or in overexpression of growth-promoting genes. In the H19/lgf cluster, in normal cells, the paternal allele has the CTCF methylated and silenced. This alows the enhancers to act on the lgf2 and activate it (by passing the CTCF).</p>
<p>In contrast, the maternal CTCF is unmethylated in normal cells and prevents the enhancers from reaching and activating the maternal lgf2.</p>
<p> In cancer cells (Wilm's tumor), the maternal CTCF is also methylated, and now  the enhancers can activate the maternal lgf2, which results in loss of imprinting and over-expression of lgf2 (double copies of active lgf2). The lgf2 is growth-promoting and leads to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent or a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and irreversibly binds to  DNA methyltransferase, which then cannot be released. Decitabine is division-dependent and has a bigger effect on  the faster replicating cells of cancer. Although decitabine is toxic in large doses with no effect on tumor suppresion, there is a smaller optimal dose  that causes DNA demethylation and tumor suppression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation changes are mitotically heritable and can pass to child cells and grandchild cells in a person's body, until they are actively erased. Once erased by drug treatment, they do not return. In this way, such drugs can kill tumor-growing cells without killing all the cells of the body.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of rapid epigenetic changes, such as the pre-implantation period and the premordial germ cell development period.</p>
<p>Treating patients during such periods, in particular young patients during germ cell development  can  afftect the entire epigenome  with unknown consequences and is not advisable under the current state of knowledge.</p></div>
