    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer alters the distribution of DNA methylation genome-wide, especially in GpC islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<ol><li>DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides. Normally, DNA methylation rarely occurs at CpG islands, once it does, DNA methylation associates with gene silencing when found at promoters. In cancer cells, in addition to genome-wide hypomethylation, there is more than expected number of DNA methylation found at CpG islands, which silent tumor suppressor genes downstream, and thus fails to stop the developing of cancer.</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually DNA methylated. If not, it leads to chromosomal instability, causing deletion, insertion or translocation of DNA segments, and illegitimate recombination between repeats, and thus they may activate cryptic promoters and disrupt neighboring genes. In cancers, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth; loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer. Take Bechwith Wiedemann Syndrome as an example. It is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, a result of disruption of imprinting. It involves two closely linked imprint control regions: kcnq1 and H19/Ifg2 clusters, on human chromosome 11.</p>
<p>kcnq1 cluster on the paternal allele is unmethylated, upregulating the long noncoding RNA kcnqot1, which recuits G9a and PRC2 that perform H3K9me and H3K27me, repressive histone marks, and thus silence genes in the region, including Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressor. Also, DNA methylation at ICR (H19/Ifg2 cluster) on the paternal allele blocks binding of CTCF; without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and then enhancers downstream can activate Igf2, an oncogene, promoting growth.</p>
<p>While kcnq1 cluster on the maternal allele is methylated, repressing the expression of kcnqot1, and thus upregulates Cdkn1c, suppressing tumorgenesis. Also, unmethylated ICR on maternal allele leads to CTCF binding, and thus insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a kind of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>It is found that a lot of lymphomas—cancers of the immune system—are caused by mutations that make enzyme EZH2 overactive. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.  Therefore, DNA-demethylating effect of Decitabine can lead to reduce the proliferation of tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin's study discovered that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. Some of the participants who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. Therefore, Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. This is how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>I think there are periods of development when I would avoid treating patients with such drugs: periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, such as pregnancy – when primordial germ cell develop and early development are involved. </p></div>
