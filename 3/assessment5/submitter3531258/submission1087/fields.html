    <div class="field-value"><p><span><strong>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. However, CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. CpG islands and CpG island shores usually remain unmethylated, allowing gene transcription.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. As a result, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and aberrant transcription may occur from incorrect transcription start sites leading to disease.</strong></span></p>
<p> <strong>In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding</strong><strong> intergenic regions. Parasitic repetitive sequences and oncogenes </strong><strong>are often repressed through methylation.Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals leads to genetic instability, such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition. </strong></span><strong>Increased karyotypic instability and activation of tumor-promoting genes by cis or trans effects, that might include altered heterochromatin-euchromatin interactions, may be important consequences of DNA hypomethylation which favor oncogenesis.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting due to hypermethilation of imprint control region is found to contribute to cancerous processes. Genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent of origin expression, no longer show this imprinted expression. Instead they become expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. </p>
<p>Under normal condition , ICR is methilated on the paternal allele and unmethilated on the maternal allele. CTCF4 is insulator and the enhancers act on h19, however Igf2 will be silenced. From the paternal allele the opposite happens and Igf2 is expressed because CTCF4 is not acting as an insulator. </p>
<p>With hypermethylation on the maternal allele Igf2 is also expressed. SO now we have a double dose of Igf2, compared to what we can find in a normal cell. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, this is associated with a particular kidney tumour called Wilm's tumour. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is observed in preneoplastic tissue, as it is a very early event in tumour growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a <span> DNA-demethylating agent. <span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.<br /><span>We know that loss of DNA methylation control can lead to uncontrolled cell growth. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors like decitabine,</span><span> take advantage of this mechanism by creating a more orderly DNA methylation profile in the hematopoietic stem cell nucleus. This way, normal blood counts are restored and retards the progression of tumours towards acute leukemia.<br /></span><br /></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike oer forms of gene regulation, Dna methylation is transmitted to daughter and granddaughter cells. Hence, drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery can have lasting effect, as these will be transmitted to new generations of cells. In particular, for cancerous cells this could be advantegous. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of drastic changes in epigenetic markers. Changes of Dna methylation during development include, pre implantation and germ cells development. It is not advisable to use these drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery in all cells, with young individuals that are undergoing sensitive periods. Because these drugs not only will target the epigenetic machinery of cancer cell but also other cells that might be undergoing a sensitive period. Any insult to such process would alter proper development. </p></div>
