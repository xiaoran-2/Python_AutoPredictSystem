    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA requires the addition of a single methyl group to cytosine at position 5.  Ordinarily, methylation of DNA results in gene silencing.  However, CpG islands (which are clusters of cytosoine-guanine sites) are typically unmethylated.  But in cancer, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated resulting in significant transcriptional gene silencing.  The methylated DNA can act as a physical barrier to proteins that are ordinarily required to bind in order for the DNA to be transcribed.  The methylation of the DNA can also result in the recruitment of other proteins that can modify the histones or remodel the chromatin, again resulting in gene silencing.</p>
<p>The genes that are silenced in this way, could be tumour suppressor genes.  Cancers assocaited with CpG hypermethytlation include MLH1 in colorectal cancer and BRAC1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>The intergenic reagions and repetitive elements can be considered in a simplified way to be the reverse of what is seen at CpG islands.  Whereas in a healthy cells CpG islands are typically unmethylated, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  But in cancerous cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are instead unmethylated.  This then allows the inappropriate activation of genes that can result in the onset of cancers.</p>
<p>The result is genomic instability with a variety of possible consequences such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, or activation of repeats, or disruption to neighbouring genes.  All of these factors can contribute to the onset of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hyper- and hypomethylation can be locus-specific or genome-wide and in both cases can affect ICR (imprint control regions) leading to the loss of imprinting.  This in turn can cause genes to be under- or overexpressed thus potentially resulting in cancers if growth-promotion is expressed and growth suppression is silenced.</p>
<p>The Igf2 gene is a paternally imprinted gene: the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated.  In the methylated state the protein CTCF can’t bind to it and thus it can’t act as an insulator as it does on the maternal allele.  Instead the downstream enhancers are free to act on and allow for the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR for the Igf2 gene is normally unmethylated.  This allows for the binding of the CTCF protein to it.  CTCF then acts as an insulator such that the downstream enhancers can’t act on Igf2 and instead activate H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele in incorrectly methylated.  This means that CTCF can’t bind, and there is no insulation to prevent Igf2 from being expressed from the maternal allele.  But Igf2 is being expressed from the paternal allele and thus overexpresion results. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and overexpression results in tumours (typically in the kidneys of children)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  It acts to hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  DNMT is the enzyme that is required to transfer a methyl group to DNA.  Thus a DNMT inhibitor such as Decitabine will result in hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Cancerous cells are often characterised by aberrant DNA methylation that could, for instance, silence tumour suppressor genes.  This unnatural situation can potentially be reversed by demethylation.  Decitabine helps to demethylate DNA and allow for the expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A senstive period is a period in development where epigenetic marks are being laid down (such as in primordial germ cell development and during pre and post-implantation embryonic periods).  Treatment should not be given to patients during these periods because epigenetic treatment/drugs can seriously alter the laying down of epigenetic marks leading to serious disruptions of the epigenetic scaffold.  Imprinting can be affected, inappropriate gene silencing can result and/or overexpression of genes can occur.  </p></div>
