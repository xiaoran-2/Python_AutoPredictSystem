    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are not methylated. They are found in the promoters of genes, and if they are methylated, the gene is silenced. In cancer, the CpG islands in the promoters of tumor supressor genes are methylated, thus silencing the tumor suppressors and leading to cancer. The cells with this epimutation are more likely to continue dividing or not die as quickly, leading to a tumor. For example, hypermethylation of BRCA1 can lead to breast cancer. Taking out one copy of a tumor suppressor gene is not enough to cause cancer, though; other tumor suppressor genes would also have to be silenced or oncogenes would need to be activated. Over time, as cancer progresses, more CpG islands in tumor suppressor genes are methylated.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. These regions of the genome are not transcribed, and methylation maintains this silencing. Methylation also helps to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition and recombination between repetitive elements. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, leading to more frequent transpositions, insertions, and deletions. For example, a mutation in DNMT3B, a gene that helps to maintain methylation, leads to genomic instability and ICF syndrome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF. Without CTCF, the DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing the gene. The downstream enhancers can then access Igf2 to activate it. (Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.)</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF can bind. The enhancers act on H19, so it is expressed and Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is often an early step in the development of cancer. In this case, if the imprinting is disrupted, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. The ICR is now methylated on both alleles, so Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. Too much of this growth promoting gene expression leads to tumors, such as Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is non-specific in its action, but it can only decrease methylation when the cell is dividing, so it has its greatest effects in rapidly dividing tumors. It is incorporated into DNA during replication and then binds to and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which is the enzyme that adds methyl groups to DNA after replication. If this enzyme is inhibited, there is less methylation in subsequent generations of the tumor cells. Less methylation can unsilence the tumor suppressor genes, leading to normally-functioning cells instead of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable. After DNA replication, each new DNA molecule is half new and half old. DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme that finds the methyl groups on CpGs in the old strands of the DNA and adds methyl groups on the mirror-image new strands. If the DNA methylation is removed before replication, it won't be added back after replication. If methylation is added before replication, it will be maintained from that point on through subsequent generations of cells. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time when the genome is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming and the environment can have an effect on the epigenome. This happens during primordial germ cell development, during pre-implantation from the fertilized egg through the blastocyst stage, and at brief windows of time for particular organs. During these sensitive periods, the maternal and paternal genomes are demethylated and the marks are later reset. During primordial germ cell development, imprinted gene marks are also cleared and reset. </p>
<p>Altering DNA methylation during a sensitive period is inadvisable because you could methylate or demethylate genes that shouldn't be changed, especially in the germ cells of young patients.</p></div>
