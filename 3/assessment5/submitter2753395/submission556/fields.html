    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation but when a CpG island is methylated this is usually associated with silencing of gene expression. An important example of this function is in the case of the chromosome X inactivation. In this case the methylation ensures that the silenced genes of the selected chromosome will remain silenced thus methylation in this case serves to ensure genomic stability.</p>
<p>In a cancer situation the CpG islands are more than likely to be methylated and this situation usually happens in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes and this hypermethylation usually happens on both copies of the genes.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation contributes to cancer as hypermethylation in specific loci, more specifically in CpG islands and CpG islands shores, results in suppression of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The main function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity as DNMT1 depleted regions show genomic instability. In repetitive elements, the primary function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability by silencing repeats to prevent transposition or transcriptional interference or prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>While in the normal cell the intergenic region is highly methylated thus preventing repetitive element of activating genes in a cancer cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated thus allowing the activation of tumor suppressor genes.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>Since the function of methylation in repeats is to maintain stability, the hypermethylation which then occurs will lead to instability. You will then have illegitimate recombinations and/or translocations between repeats. But the disruption of DNA methylation can also be hypomethylation which will also lead to instability as the DNA will be not as densely packaged as it should be leading to the possibility of the repeats making a copy of themselves which could be inserted anywhere thus disrupting the coding region of one or many genes. The result is deletions, insertions, and general instability. It must be mentioned that the consequences of hypermethylation or hypomethylation are context dependent and depend on location.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.On the paternal allele DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF which is an insulator protein. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoters and thus silences H19. This frees the enhancers to access Igf2 to activate it.</p>
<p>2.On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated thus allowing the insulator protein CTCF binding. The enhancers can thus activate H19 and are isolated from Igf2.</p>
<p>3.In normal cells, the paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. CTCF binds to the maternal ICR and the enhancers then express H19 while on the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the enhancers then turn on Igf2. In the cancer cell both the maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated. Therefore the enhancers do not have access to H19 and in both allele they express Igf2 thus resulting in an overexpression of Igf2. The maternal allele then acts as the paternal allele and it is as if two paternal alleles were expressed causing an increased cell growth.</p>
<p>4.Since normally Igf2 is silent in the maternal allele, when methylation of the ICR occurs both the paternal and maternal Igf2 are expressed and this overexpression of Igf2 leads to the development of Wilm’s tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine, </strong>an epigenetic drug, is a DNA-demethylating agent.</p>
<p>It “binds DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) in: an irreversible manner. The sequestration of DNMTs prevents maintenance of the methylation state of DNA, leading to DNA hypomethylation.” (A. Nguyen, Lung cancer: Targets and Therapy)</p>
<p>This hypomethylation allows re-expression of genes that were silenced by the methylation, including tumour suppressor genes. This effect can last as the changes to DNA methylation are passed on from mother cells to daughter cells during cell division.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The effects of drugs that bring changes to DNA methylation can last beyond the treatment period as these changes are passed on from mother cells to daughter cells during cell division.</p>
<p>I would refrain from using such drugs during “sensitive periods”. Such periods can be defined as periods during which the genome is being developed. Obviously gestation is one of those periods but even more so the early days of gestation during germcell development and early embryonic development. At this time epigenetic marks need to be erased between generations to restore totipotency. There are here two periods of reprogramming: primordial germcell development and early development. The period of genomic imprinting is equally a sensitive period as the period of the formation of gametes.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that would modify the epigenome during those periods as the action of the drug might go against the normal coding of protein and the expression of genes as well as causing transcription errors. If an interference with the normal action of the genes, if a disruption occurs it could lead to an aberrant expression of genes causing different diseases or syndromes.</p>
