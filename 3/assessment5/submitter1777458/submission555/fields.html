    <div class="field-value"><p>methyl group bonds to the number 5 carbon on the Cytosine ring. In mammals this methylation is on Cytosine base that precedes Guanine (CpG). 60 to 90 % of all mammalian CpGs are methylated.</p>
<p> The Normal function of Methylation is to silence the expression of the genomic sequence by making the promoter of that gene inaccessible. It does this by bringing about the formation of tightly bound chromatin. This would therefore be advantageous if it was silencing a sequence that promotes Cancer Growth, but disadvantageous if suppressing sequences that promote tumour suppressor mechanisms.</p>
<p>Cancer can be characterised as a combination of epigenetic and genetic effects. Although which one precedes the other is not certain, it is evident from research such as Hassler and Egger that the presence of epigenetic and genetic hallmarks throughout the genome contribute to the proliferation of cancerous states. Methylation that is observed in normal cells is within intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation is even observed within introns of genes themselves.  CpG islands in normal functioning cells are not methylated. In a cancer cell these sections of methylation are reversed and the methylation is more likely observed in the CpG islands of the cell.  The intergentic regions and repetitive elements in this case are Hypo methylated. The disruption of cell cycle, apoptosis and repair is accomplished by the Hyper methylation of the promoter CpG islands. The hypermethylation of these CpGs can do the same job as if it was mutated, and in the case of single gene diseases such as Retina Blastoma or Breast Cancer where the RB and BRCA1 genes are hypermethylated and thus silenced.</p>
<p>In all tumours that have been observed and researched, there is a direct hypo methylation at satellite repeats. The methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive regions  silences genes which are important to physiological processes such as differentiation and can therefore lead to disease states such as cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes that are imprinted are involved in growth suppression and promoting. The loss of an imprinted gene may come about due to the Hypermethylation or Hypomethylation at the Imprint Control Regions of the DNA sequence. A common feature of cancer cells is that they have a loss of imprinting. Hypermethylation of both parental alleles of Imprinting control region of H19/Igf2 cluster results in the inability of CTCF binding and leads to over expression of lgf2 which is a growth promoter. known as Wilm’s Tumour.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the paternal allele has a methylated ICR and as a result enhancers further downstream can act on the Igf2 region for expression and not on the H19 region due to blockage from CTCF. In the maternal allele, the ICR is un methylated and as a result, the maternal ICR is bound by protein CTCF, which is a insulator protein. This insulates the Igf2 gene from being acted upon by the enhancer regions downstream. Instead the enhancer region acts on the H19 sequence which is involved in chromatin tightening. loss of imprinting in the maternal by methylation to the ICR, means no CTCF binding and thus enhancers are able to express the Igf2 region in the maternal allele and therefore produce double the amount of growth promotion in cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents or Hypomethylation agents whose chemical name is <span>4-Amino-1-(2-deoxy-β-</span><small>D</small><span>-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2(1</span><em>H</em><span>)-one, and </span>are used against solid tumors known as <span>myelogenous leukaemia</span>. Its  main action is to inhibit methyl transferases. Methyl transferases are responsible for the methylation and thus silencing of gene clusters which are needed for tumour suppression, cell deifferenciation and appoptosis. By inhibiting the action of methyl transferases resulting in <span>hypomethylation of DNA regions responsible for  tumor suppression genes, means the correct expression and operation of tumor suppressing sequences. Since the action of the hypomethylation is chemical in nature, there is no changing the genetic sequence itself and Because the effects of epigenetics can be passed to daughter cells Decitabine can therefore have an anti-tumour effect specifically on the regions of effected cells and not effect normal functioning cells. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA on an epigenetic level do not alter the DNA sequence itself, but rather change the chemical environment that effects gene expression therefore allowing for chemotherapy to be used. DNA Hypermethylation and Hypomethylation are synonymous with gene silencing and expression respectively. by effecting the amount of methylation of particulate dna regions effects the amount of gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Because the epigenetic marks are passed onto daughter cell generations until the marks are errased drugs can have a long effect beyond the period of the drug itself. Sensitive periods are defined as the time of sensetive development of the germ cells where imprinting and inactivation occurs, such as the sperm development in the pubecent period of males or the oocyte development of females when they are still fetus's. Treating patients during sentitive periods would be inadvisable as the epigentic marks that are established or errased could be altered during these sensitive periods. So treating pregnant mother in their third trimester for example or males that are reaching puberty. These periods are the important stages when the epigenetic marks are eighter passed on or errased and any altercations can influence the future cell lines that are produced and DNA sequences that are expressed or silenced.  </p></div>
