    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are unmethylated. However, when these very islands are methylated the main goal of this mark is to silence gene expression, as it is in the case of the X chromosome inactivation in female mammals to compensate the gene dosage between both sexes.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated in order to silence tumor suppressing genes, thus contributing to uncontrolled cell growth, one of the hallmarks of cancer. As this mark is mitotically heritable, these epimutations are rapidly selected and even progress with time.</p>
<p>In order to maintain genomic integrity and stability in a healthy individual, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are typically methylated. This is an effective way to prevent deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocation and illegitimate recombination between repeats. In contrast, these regions are hypomethylated in cancer due to mutations in genes coding for the methyltranferases enzymes that lay down the methyl groups (DNMT1 in mice, DNMT3B in humans). As a result, this epigenetic modification results in genetics abnormalities and viceversa. The genetic instability further enables mutations and abnormalities that contribute to the unregulated cell proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The control region of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 locus is methylated, which means this gene is paternally imprinted. This methylation prevents binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the paternal control region. Enhancers, located downstream, act on Igf2, promoting its expression from the paternal allele. This is the preferred loop of these enhancers.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the control region is unmethylated, enabling CTCF binding. As a result this region is insulated for enhancers to act, so they act on H19 instead, resulting in production of H19, a long non coding RNA, just produced in the maternal allele. Consequently, Igf2 expression is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour both paternal and maternal H19/Igf2 control regions are methylated, which leads to overexpression of Igf2 from both alleles, and no H19 production. This is a doubled dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell. Being Igf2 a growth factor that promotes growth and division of cells, its overproduction can result in cancer, as a consequenceof the contiouous growth stimulus.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is drug classified as a DNMT inhibitor (DNMT:<em> de novo</em> methyltranferases), so it is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is oncrporated in the DNA and it binds to DNMT irreversibly and its effect is replication dependent. As a consequence, highly replicating cancers are more affected (myeloid leukemia for example).</p>
<p>Based on the locus specific DNA hypermethylation that occurs in cancer at CpG islands and CpG island shores to silence tumour suppressor genes, therapy with Decitabine can counteract this abnormality restoring the normal function of affected genes which are critical for control of cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is copied as the cell divides by the enzyme DNMT1, which recognizes the hemi-methylated DNA strand resulted from DNA replication. If a DNMT inhibitor is used, the DNA methylation will eventually become diluted as the cell divides.</p>
<p>The use of drugs targeting epigenetic machinery must be cautious in young patients. This issue arises from the fact that these drugs lack of specificity can affect germ cells. These cells undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming during its development until matured gametes are formed. This is a sensitive period where alteration or removal of the normal processes can result in epigentic abnormalities.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the alterations that ca result during oogenesis or espermatogenesis derived from the effect of drugs with epigenetic targets. Both eggs and sperm cells are highly specialized cells that need a particular set of genes to be expressed. This specific gene expression is achieved through epigenetic reprogramming. If this process is altered, abnormalities regarding the patient's gametes and/or fertility will not be unexpected.</p></div>
