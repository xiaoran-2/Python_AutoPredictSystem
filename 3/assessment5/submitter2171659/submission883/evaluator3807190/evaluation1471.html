    <div class="field-value">The candidate displays a general understanding of the main issues in epigenetics. The answers to the quizzes would have been more clearly explained, had the candidate reviewed the lectures, and input epigenetic terms precisely like 'epigenetics, CTFC, DNA methylation/unmethylation', and have explained what sensitive periods were.

It is clear the candidate made an effort to be informed about case examples in the press, which lead to an interesting narrative, even when not always targeting the answers.

In question 1, the candidate should have mentioned what happens in CpG shores in normal cells and in cancer, and a more definite explanation could have been given to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, emphasising that these tend to methylated in cancer.

In question 2, the explanation is logical, but for it to be complete, CTCF should have been part of the answer.

In question 3, an explanation is given that Decitabine is a demethylating agent, which is partly correct. In order to give the answer a 100%, it should have been mentioned the precise class of Decitabine, which is a DNMTi, or DNA Methytransferase inhibitor, which triggers DNA demethylation. As a reminder, all these details are in the last lecture of Week 6 of the course: "Drugs that target the epigenetic machinery as chemotherapeutics".

For question 4, a review of the last lectures of Week 4 and the beginning lectures of Week 5 would have covered all the answers (e.g. sensitive periods of development are the ones when cells are being reprogrammed, i.e. the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cel development).
