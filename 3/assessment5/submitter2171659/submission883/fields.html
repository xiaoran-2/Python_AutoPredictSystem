    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While it is estimated that around 70-80% of CpG are methylated in the genome of healthy humans, this is not the case in CpG islands - portions of promoter regions that are enriched with CpGs, these are generally unmethylated.  In cancer, by contrast, it has been found that at some loci CpG islands can become hyper-methylated and this is thought to play a functional role by silencing the underlying gene.  Cancer has also been associated with the CIMP state (CpG island methylator phenotype) and this highly methylated state in the BRAF gene is thought to associated with microsatellite instability and inappropriate recombination.  An association has been observed with malignancy and metastatic potential in breast cancer and gliomas.  Tumours appeared to gain a high amount of methylation during disease progression</p>
<p>By contrast intergenice regions and repetitive elements tend to be highly methylated - possibly to help suppress alternative transcription start sites or inappropriate transcriptions of non-functional genetic material.  There has been at least one report of not global but directed hypomethylation (decreased methylation) in <span>malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.  This reduced methylation was found in satellite repeats</span>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If drugs result in lower levels methylation this reduced methylation may be stably inherited as the cells divided - since the information to restablish the epigenetic marks may be missing.  Whereas if the outcome is higher methylation, daughter strands of the dividing cell may be methylated at the same location resulting in stable inheritence.  There may be particular times where this could create problems - an obvious one would be if the cancer patient is pregnant and there could be changes in the developing embryo.  But even conception - particularly in men who have constant sperm production - might be problematic (presumably this is not many cancer patients minds anyway).  </p>
<p>Some studies - particularly in a rural community in Northern Sweden - have suggested that the pre-puberty time might be sensitive period.  In Sweden it was found that young boys growing up times of agricultural plenty were more likely to have grandchildren who suffered from diabetes.  However, this is still a controversial finding.  Nonetheless caution should probably be observed in treating children with these classes of drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is demethylation agent that has been used to experimentally treat <span>myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  This drug reduces the global amount of methylation.  In the Economist article it does not mention decitabine being used against tumours, but a related demethylating agent, <span>azacitidine, has been used in combination with a histone deacetylase inhibitor against advanced lung tumours and found to slow tumour growth.  This is not unexpected since the methylation load of tumours seems to increase with time, but it was the first time an epigenetic drug has shown effect against a solid tumour - as opposed to a leukeamia.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilms tumour is a cancer of the kidney that is a result of faulty imprinting - the process by which the expression of a gene is determined by whether it is on the paternal or maternal allele.  In normal cells the promoter of H19 (just downstream of igf2) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  H19 is a non-coding RNA that intefers in igf2 expression, hence - due to imprinting - on the maternal allele H19 is expressed and igf2 is not, while on the paternal allele the situation is reversed.  Wilms tumour the maternal allele loses its imprinting and behaves like the paternal allele.  This means expression of H19 is supressed on both alleles and igf2 expression is upregulated.  Since igf2 is a growth factor, this increased expression has a tumour promoting effect.</p></div>
