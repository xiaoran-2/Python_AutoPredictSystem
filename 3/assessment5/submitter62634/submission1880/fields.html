    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in a wide range of promoters within the gen and are closely related with the expression of the underlying gene. In general, this CpG islands are more likely to be found free of methylation in normal cells, being this independent of their actual activity state. While being free of methylation in normal cells, this CpG islands are heavily hypermethylated in every type of cancer studied so far. This affect mainly the expression of the tumour suppressor genes linked with this methylated promoters. As long as epigenetic marks are inherited by the daughter cells, the cell division of the tumour cells has a competitive advantage in comparison with normal cells, thus growing up faster. This is generally considered to be one important factor related with tumourigenesis.<br />Intergenic regions and repatitive elements constitute a large portion of the genome and are expected to be methylated in normal cells. This wide-genome methylation is indeed very important to preserve genomic stability, serving as a way of densely packaging the chromatine. In tumour cells this intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, thus leading to deletions, insertions and illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. There is clear evidence linking cancer with genomic instability, being one of the possible reasons the increase of aberrant translation caused by transpositions or other mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the ways in wich a altered methylation pattern leads to cancer is the loss of imprinting in the ICR's (Imprinting Control Regions). A classical example of such a loss of imprinting is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells this cluster displays monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression, meaning that the gene turns out to be expressed in one allele and silenced in the other. In the case of the maternal allele, the ICR within this cluster is unmethylated, binding a CTCF insulator that blocks the enhancers action over the promoter of the Igf2 gene, thus activating the expression of the H19 gene. In the case of the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR frees the way for the enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene. In the case of Wilm's tumour, both alleles are methylated, thus doubling up the expression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article, Decitabine "belongs to DNA-demethylating agents". More specificly, it is a DNMT inhibitor. Generaly speaking, it inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), the enzimes that catalyzes the methylation process. Methylation has a broad impact on the epigenome, but in general it is asociated with silencing gen expression and genomic stability. There is strong evidence linking CpG island's hypermethylation with cancer cells, in wich case it leads to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Inhibiting the inheritance of this aberrated epigenomic mark throughout cell division, wich is higher in cancer cells, may help to control the tumour tissue growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As long as epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable, it seems possible that after being exposed to them, the new epigenomic scenario improves the response of tumour cells to other therapies, chemotherapy in the case presented in the article. There are periods, all along from fertilization to adult life, when there is a general reset on the epigenome of a particular tissue or in general in the whole organism. The two main sensitive periods are the early development in utero and the primordial germ cells development. Any epigenomic alteration in this periods is critical and has long range consecuences. There is evidence that any manipulation during this periods may produce unexpected outcomes in the epigenetic pattern, being an example (still under research) the impact on the epigenome of the assisted reproductive techniques.</p></div>
