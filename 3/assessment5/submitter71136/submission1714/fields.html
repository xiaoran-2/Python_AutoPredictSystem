    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be found  at the promoters of genes, the place where the Transcription Factors bind. DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing, in general, in normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, however, there are particular times during the cell life when certain CpG islands are methylated. For example, in females, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated due to hypermethylation of GpG islands.</p>
<p>In contrast, CpG islands in cancer cells are more likely to be methylated. These islands are usually located in the promoters of tumour suppresor genes. Another difference between normal and cancer cells is that, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, whereas in normal cells they are hypermethylated, the reason why this occur is to mantain genome stability, namely, to avoid insertions, deletions and translocations. These events occur between different parts of the genome that are very similar, in a normal cell, this would not happen since the DNA would be methylated and densely packaged. Insertions may cause the disruption of the coding region of a gene, activation of neighbouring genes or activation of cryptic promoters</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprint control regions is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele, in this case, the insulator element CTCF will bind to the ICR, provoking that the enhacer will act on H19 but Igf2 will remain silent. Whereas, in the paternal allele, since the ICR is methylated CTCF will not bind, allowing the enhacers will act on Igf2, so it will be expressed.</p>
<p>When loss of imprinting happens, the ICR is methylated in both alleles, so the expression of Igf2 is double than in a normal cell. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, it will cause a type of cancer known as Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is an early event observed in many types of tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a type of DNA Methyl transferase inhibitor, therefore, it avoids the binding of the methyl group to the CpG. This can be useful in the treatment of cancer since it would impeed the hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumour repressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitoticaly inheritable which means that it will be mantained during cell division and thus, during the lifetime of the individual.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when the environment could alter the epigenetic makeup. This happen during two periods in the lifetime of a mammal: From primordial germ cell development to production of eggs or sperm and pre-implantation and early-implantation.</p>
<p>During these periods, epigenetic reprogramming is going on, so, a treatment during these periods could be disruptive to the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
