    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>We understand that there is a normal global level of tissue methylation at CpG islands, which is stable, and it gradually decreases as a normal tissue becomes a cancerous tissue. This progression of the normal tissue is through hyperplasia, neoplasia and finally invasive metastatic tissue, and we know that at some CpG islands methylation becomes more dense in this process.</p>
<p>A difference in the methylation of a normal cell and a cancer cell, is that we see methylation in the intergenic region and the repetitive element in the normal cell and no methylation in the CpG island, whereas in the cancer cell the CpG island is more likely to be methylated and the intergenic and repetitine element regions non-methylated.</p>
<p>So what we see is a kind of a swap in the methylation process, between normal and cancer cells.</p>
<p>We also call the condition of the CpG island of a cancer cell, "hypermethylation".</p>
<p>CpG islands hypermethylation is very important, since there are particular CpG islands that tell us if some tissue is cancer, a tumor, or normal skin. We realize how importan this process of distinguising is for a patient. Biomarkers guide us in this process. Panels of biomarkers through CpG island hypermethylation, help us, after many genome studies, to identify tumour types and possibly sub-types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many of the inprinted genes, are important for growth. Eithe in promoting or supressing growth.</p>
<p>In cancer, we many find in imprint control regions, both hypermethylation, as well as hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated in H19 and the maternal allele is non-methylated, and this leads to lgf2 expression.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumour, both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, which leads to lgf2 overexpression, and hypermethylation of the imprint control region on both alleles. Essentially a double dose of lfg2 from what is found on a normal cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DND-demethylating agents, as does azacitidine. It is used to treat myeolodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Acting on the epigenetic level, drugs refered in the article, would help in the battle against cancer, by stoping the tumours from growing, without killings all of their cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic changes are passed on, through cell division, altering them can have the enduring effect, untill they are actively erased.</p>
<p>At each individual type of tumour, and at the different stages of disease, epigenetic based therapy and drugs, will have to be considered on their effectiveness. This is because the effect of DNA methylation depletion can be specific to the stage of the tumour's condition. Different tumours have different dependencies. And these dependencies change during the tumour's existense.</p>
