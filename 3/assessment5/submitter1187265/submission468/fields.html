    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mainly involved in silencing a gene. Hyoermethylation does not allow the transcription factors to bind and silencing the associated gene. In cancer, DNA methylation can be altered in three regions: CpG islands, intergenic regions, repititive elements. In normal tissue, usually CpG islands are hypo-methylated, and intergenic regions and repititive elements are hyper methylated.</p>
<p>At CpG islands, most CG pairs are unmethylated causing activation of the associated genes. CpG islands are found in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes. In cancer, CpG islands get methylated which silences these tumor suppressor genes. This is how, hyper methylation in CpG islands can contribute to disease by disrupting cell apoptosis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions or CpG poor regions and repititive elements become hypo-methylated in cancer. hypo-methylation of CpG poor regions can either activate oncogenes or other micro RNA which target tumor suppressor genes. In case of repititve elements, hypo methylation activates them and then the repititive elements cause genomic instability like insertions, deletion etc by jumping around and copying themselves in other places. Also the loss of identity, open-chromatin, and mis-alignment created by repititive elements cause reciprocal translcation between two different chromosomes. These chromosomal instability also contribute to tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes should be mono-allelic. This mono-allelic expression is caused by methylation in one of the two alleles. Many of these imprinted genes are involeved in growth i.e. either growth promoting or growth suppressing. Methylation disruption in them can create tumor. For example, H19/Igf2 cluster is associated with growth in kidney.</p>
<p>In paternal allele, the promoter region of H19 cluster is methylated and hence CTCF can not bind in the corresponding imprint control region. Thus the enhancer in the downstream of H19 acts on Igf2 and activates the gene. In contrast in matternal allele, H19 is not methylated and CTCF binds in the promoter which prevents the enhancer to act on Igf2. So, Igf2 remains silenced in maternal allele. In cancer, Igf2 of both allele becomes active as now H19 in maternal allele is unmethylated. The double dose of Igf2 causes growth promotion and tumor a a result. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is one of the epigenetic drugs which are available in the market. <span>Decitabine is a </span></span>DNA demethylating agents and it is used to treat the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia, namely<span> myelodysplastic syndromes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In an study led by <span>Dr Stephen Baylin, it has been found that epigenetic drugs can penetrate solid tumors which are usually harder to treat. These is another speculation by the the same study that epigenetic drugs modifies the tumor cells to become easily affected by standard chemotherapy as the study subject showed an improvement on chemotherapy after the application of epigenetic drugs. Since the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter, granddaughter cells until they are actively erased and these marks do not return once erased, epigenetic therapies might be able to stop cancer without having the cells actually killed. However, the early development and primordial germ cell development i.e. when the epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed are sensitive period with respect to establishing epigentic marks. It could be sensitive for applying such epigenetic drugs during this period. Many reprogramming happens based on cell specific manner. Disruption of epigenetic reprogramming or epigenetic marks re-establishment might cause adverse effect.</span></span></p></div>
