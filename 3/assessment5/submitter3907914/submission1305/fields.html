    <div class="field-value"><p>  DNA methylation at a CpG island, where promoters are usually found, prevents transcription factors from binding thereby silencing genes downstream of the promoter if it is functioning normally. In cancer, hypermethylation at CpG islands can cause silencing of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, thus causing tumors to grow. Also hypomethylation can cause activation of oncogenes. The cells grow quickly and gain the advantage over other cells, thus allowing mitotically heritable epigenetic mutations to proliferate and contribute to cancer. Silencing the promoters at CpG islands through DNA methylation inactivates genes that should normally be activated for healthy function. Similarly, some genes must remain silenced, or else they could cause disease. For example, a transposon might jump into another region of a genes and cause it to create a truncated protein which may be essential for life processes. DNA is more likely to be methylated at introns, intergenic regions and at repetitive elements so that the genes are not expressed. However, in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not silenced, thus genes that would normally not be expressed, like oncogenes, or transposons, which can disrupt genomic integrity, can cause changes in growth of cells. Intergenic regions may contain cryptic promoters or splice sites, which transcribe in the opposite direction. This means that RNA pol II might bump into each other and affect transcription of a genes, thus resulting in truncated proteins if these promoters aren't silenced by methylation. Repetitive elements make a copy of themselves, jump out of the genome, insert themselves somewhere else in the genome and disrupt transcription. resulting in truncated proteins. If these repetitive elements aren't silenced, they are allowed to perform this function and create improperly functioning proteins. If proteins don't function properly, then this can lead to what we call a disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  At the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, which spread to silence H19. CTCF cannot bind there. The chromatin then loops back so the enhancers are near Igf2 to enhance expression of Igf2 upstream. At the maternal allele, the imprint control region and H19 are unmethylated. This allows the insulator, CTCF, to bind to the imprint control region. CTCF prevents the chromatin from looping back so that the enhancer can activate Igf2. Because of this, when the chromatin loops, the enhancers instead loop towards the closer unmethylated H19 region. H19 then expresses a long non coding RNA for a separate function unrelated to establishment of imprinting. Cdkn1c is a gene on the maternal allele that acts as a tumor suppressor when kcnq1 is methylated. Igf2 is an oncogene which promoted growth. If Cdkn1c in unmethylated than it will not suppress tumor growth. If Igf2 is activated on the paternal allele, then without the tumor suppression of other genes, Igf2 is free to over express. Thus there is no check on growth and a Wilm's tumor is free to form. This type of imprinting abnormality can result in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents which strip methylation of the genes. Decitabine demethylates parts of DNA associated with tumor suppression. When the tumor suppressors are methylated, the genes are turned off and tumors can grow. However, when the genes are demethylated by decitabine, the tumor suppressor genes are turned on and prevent tumors from growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  DNA is not constantly being methylated and demethylated. A sensitive period is a period where the epigenetics marks of an organism are being cleared, reestablished, and remodeled. The sensitive periods are the periods of development from primordial germ cell development to maturation of eggs and sperm, and then the second period is the preimplantation period starting with gametes to the early post implantation ending with the epiblast. Other sensitive periods of development might be during puberty. Or another example might be in the early days of a mouse's life where it may need maternal care to establish epigenetic marks that help cope with stress throughout its lifetime. After that sensitive period, the epigenome is inherited mitotically throughout the lifetime of the organism. The drugs that demethylate are not entirely specific. If you treat a disease of one tissue during a sensitive period for another tissue, you may unintentionally interfere with marks that should be in place, but would be blocked by the drug. Thus advantageous genes may not be turned on at the right time and may have lasting consequences in development.</p></div>
