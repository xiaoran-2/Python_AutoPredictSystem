    <h1>Submission 835 from Anon (session_user_id: c6e2e191b7553a9c20efec1629d5ff68d53ac5fa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demthylating drug. Therefore, it belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors, which are nucleoside analogues that bind DNMTs irreversibly, rendering the enzymes useless. This mechanism is replication dependent, since it affects the DNMTs which are only active during mitosis, adding the appropriate methylation to the daughter DNA-strand.This relates to the anti-tumour effect. A dividing cell lacking DNMTs can not establish the methylation marks on the daugther DNA-strands, thus effectively removing hypermethylation in daughter cells. Hypermethylation is found in CpG-islands of tumour suppressor genes. In daughter cells, these CpG-islands can no longer be methylated and the tumour suppressor gene is therefore no longer suppressed but actively expressed, thus having an anit-tumour efect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of DNA is an epigentic mark regulatiing gene expression, which is abberant in cancer cells. Drugs (e.g. DNMTis) can reset the original epigentic state by removing or adding methyl-groups, since epimutations are reversible. The methylation of DNA, once set, is usually very stable, i.e. it is maintained by the cell. Therefore, an epigenetic drug can have effects beyond the period of drug treatment. Also, methylation of DNA is mitotical heritable, so daughter cells inherit the reset methylation marks as well.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are certain perios in human development, when the epigenome undergoes changes, i.e. the methylation marks are first removed and then reset. The two sensitive periods (in mammals) are early embryonic development and germ cell development. After being reset the methylation state of the DNA is maintained (somatic maintenance). During sensitive periods epigenetic drugs should not be used, since they can interfere with the removing and resetting processes, which, through methylation, could change the expression of genes. A misexpression of genes hinders cells from functioning normally, which could then cause diseases or, in severe cases, even cell death. In germ cells, the epimutations could be inherited.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, normal cells have more global methylation and less methylated CpG-islands than cancer cells. As the cancer progresses, global methylation is reduced and CpG-island methylation is increased.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG-islands are hypomethylated (unmethylated), and therefore their genes are actively expressed. The methylation of these CpG-islands, which are common in promoters, silences a gene. This is primarily due to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. In cancer cells, the methylation pattern is reversed, i.e. the CpG-islands are hypermethylated, changing the gene expression pattern of the cell. The hypermethylation of a CpG-island can cause cancer if the silenced gene is a tomour suppressor gene. Since it is no longer expressed, it can not suppress tomour genesis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell, hypermethylated intergenic regions and repetetive elements both help maintain genomic integrity. Again, the methylation pattern is reversed in cancer cells. When intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated in cancer cells, genomic integrity can no longer be maintained. Therefore, the genome becomes instable. For example, translocations, deletions or insertions can occur. This contributes to cancer because genes can be silenced (e.g. because a transposon was inserted into it) or mulitplied (too many copies), changing the gene expression pattern. If these genes are tomour supressors or oncogenes respectively, this can lead to cancer. Additionally, hypomethylation of mentioned regions can activate cryptic promoters which causes disruptions to neighbouring genes, again changing the gene expression pattern of the cell. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted gene in humans. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, allowing for CTFC to insulate lgf2 against the downstream enhancers. Therefore, the enhancers can enhance H19 (a lncRNA), which is expressed, while lgf2 is silenced. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, which blocks CTCF from binding. This leads to the spread of the methylation to the H19 promoter, silencing its expression. Additionally, the enhancers can can now access and enhance lgf2, leading to its expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, both the maternal and paternal ICRs and H19s are hypermethylated. This causes the silencing of H19 on both alleles on the one hand, and the expression of lgf2 on both alleles on the other hand. Thus, there is now no H19 and double the amount of lgf2. Since lgf2 is a growth factor, it can contribute to cancer, because it can cause cells to grow and consequently divide above the normal level, producing a tomour.</p></div>
