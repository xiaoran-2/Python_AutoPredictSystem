    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island is often present at the promoter of gene and it is not methylated in normal cells. This means gene is active and not silenced. In cancer, CpG island is abnormally hypermethylated at tumor suppressor genes and thus silencing tumor suppressor genes and promote cell proliferation. The repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated in normal cells. The repetitive elements can disrupt the gene by transposition. DNA methylation of repetitive elements prevents improper recombination and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoter. DNA methylation is mutagenic as cytosine (C) is prone to deamination to Thymine (T) after oxidation of 5mC. DNA methylation in intergenic regions prevents genetic instability. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated which results in genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoter and disruption to neoghbouring genes. This results in deletions, insertion and reciprocal translocation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At H19/Igf2 cluster, imprinted controlling region (ICR) is methylated in paternal allele. CTCF insulator protein can not bind to methylated ICR. In absence of CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silence its expression thus enabling downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 and activates it. In contrast, maternal allele is not methylated at ICR, thus CTCF insulator protein can bind to ICR and insulates downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, thus prevent its expression but instead enhandcers act on H19 which results in H19 expression. ICR is hypermethylated in Wilm's tumour. CTCF insulator protein can not bind to methylated ICR, thus downstream enhancers can activate Igf2 expression in both paternal and maternal allele results in overexpression of Igf2 which is growth promoting (oncogene).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase enzyme thus <span>Decitabine belongs to DNA  methyltransferase inhibitor class. In cancer, upregulation of DNA methyltransferase by for example mutation causes hypermethylation of histones and thus silence tumor suppressor genes whose role is to control cell groth and prevent cancer. Using inhibitors of DNA-methyltransferase like <span>Decitabine</span>, it is possible to decrease such hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and thus decrease tumor cell proliferation. <span>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which is the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenic changes are mitotically inherited into daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once they are removed or erased, they do not return. Thus treating patients with DNA demethylation agents might have decreased DNA methylation in cancer cells and stop cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Early development and premordial germ cell development are sensitive period of Epigenetic reprogramming during development. It means if error or changes occur during these periods, it could result in epigenetic abnormalities. It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods for example younger patients who have developing germ cells as it would change the environment for epigenetic machinery and can result in abnormalities.</p></div>
