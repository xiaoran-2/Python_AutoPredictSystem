    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>DNA methylation is the most important epigenetic phenomenon which can induce gene silencing,mediate X inactivation and genomic imprinting. CpG islands are dispersed all over the genome and are found in about 60% of gene promotors.Normally,promotor regions of genes are hypomethylated in active genes and hypermethylated in inactive ones.For example,tumor suppressor genes must be kept active in normal individuals with hypomethylated promotor regions.However, in cancer cells aberrant methylation is a universal feature. Hypermethylation of promotor region and its CpG islands leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle leading to aberrant cell division and malignancy.DNA methylation of CpG rich sites termed CIMP was first identified in colorectal cancer, followed by others such as glioma. Its detection allowed sub-classification of tumours and determination of metastatic potential. Also methylation of CpG island shores 2kb surrounding CpG islands were found to be hypermethylated in cancer.In addition, aberrant DNA methylation can result from mutation of epigenetic enzymes demonstrated in aging with global loss of DNA methylation content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Transposable elements frequently disturbing the sequence of the genome can make a lot of harmful effects if not silenced.Repititive DNA sequences constitute more than 45% of the human genome derived mainly from transposable elements. Among these sequences are LINEs and SINEs, their relative abundance can cause spontaneous gene mutations.Also intergenic regions such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions are dispersed in the normal genome.All these elements must be kept hypermethylated in normal genome. HOwever, in cancer , these elements are hypomethylated with many harmful consequences. These include effects of transposable elements if activating normally silent genes and genomic instability with possible translocations which are found both in cancer and in other diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>H19 and Igf2 are in close proximity in a genomic region controlled by enhancer and insulator. The whole imprinting mechanism is methylation dependent, where in the maternal side the ICR not being methylated binds the CTCF protein thus allowing stimulation of H19. On the paternal side, methylation of the ICR prevents binding of CTCF leading to enhancers acting on  Igf2 and its activation, also H19 is methylated.</p>
<p>This implies that the more methylation found on paternal chromosomes than maternal one leads to reversion of these 2 gene activities.</p>
<p>Disruption of gene methylation in cancer leads to either hyper or hypo-methylation of genes with loss of genomic imprinting. This is demonstrated when both Igf2 genes are activated (not only the paternal one), this leads to Wilm’s tumor which affects the kidney in children.</p>
<p>It is evident that loss of expression pattern of two genes and effect of dosage disruption  will ultimately cause disease by either hyper or hypo-function of imprinted genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decitabine is a drug targeting DNMT, it inhibits methylation of DNA. Its action is division dependent in replicating cells as it is a nucleoside analogue, where it prevents binding DNMT to daughter strand. Dose adjustment is an important issue where in high doses it is toxic, while in proper low doses causes hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is a feature of cancer, This problem can be targeted by the use of DNMT inhibitor drugs such as Decitabine.  However, there is no guarantee it will target cancer cells only, it may cause hypomethylation of normal cells too.</p>
<p>It was found  that this drug is highly effective in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome with no marked side effects, but its role in treatment of solid tumors is not yet established.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>Sensitive period is that where extensive epigenetic reprogramming takes place. It occurs twice., the first time is during primordial germ cell development and the second is at early development .Childhood is also an important period especially in females where oocytes remain in a haploid demethylated state until puberty. Any factor that cause changes in the epigenetic make-up in those sensitive periods can result in possible implications for fertility and on offspring of exposed females.That is why it is not advised to use drugs targeting epigenome during these periods where changes occuring are maintained in cell lieages causing disease susceptibility later on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One theory proposed for better effect of chemotherapy after the use of drugs targeting the epigenome is that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased. once erased, they never reccur. Epigenetic therapies can thus effect changes that arrest cancer without killing its cells.</p>
