    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are frequently found in promoter regions of various genes. DNA methylation at CpG islands then acts as a mechanism for gene silencing via two specific methods: the first involves the binding of MeCP group of proteins to the methylated cytosines, and in turn attracting chromatin condensing complexes that can alter chromatin sturcture to suppress gene expression, the second prevents gene expression via direct occlusion of the transcription factor binding sites at the promoter by the corresponding methyl groups. In healthy tissues the CpG islands that are found at promoter regions are typically unmethylated. In cancer, however, hypermethylation of these CpG islands is frequently observed. This can have an effect on the expression of many genes, most importantly the tumor suppressor genes, thus contributing to the tumor advancement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are, on the contrary, typically found in a largely methylated state in normal cells (at 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides throughout the nucleus of a normal mammalian cell), this is thought to contribute to genome stability as well as preventing the activity of transposable elements. In cancerous cells a hypomethylation is observed wich may then contribute to transposon reactivation as well as genome instability, ultimately increasing the likelihood of events such as gene translocations which lead to further alteration of that cell's function.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele Igf2 is expressed because the CTCF binding site is methylated  together with the promoter region for H19, because of this the downstream enhancers contribute to Igf2 expression. On the maternal allele the CTCF transcription repressor is able to bind and block the activity of the enhancers on Igf2, thus preventing expression. The promter region for H19 is not methylated and this gene is thus expressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>There are three main ways in which this imprinting can be disrupted and lead to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which in turn, may result in Wilm's tumor:</p>
<p>- Mutation or gene deletions may result in loss of imprinting</p>
<p>- Two copies of the father's chromosome may be present, and none of the mother's</p>
<p>- There may be a loss of epigenetic imprinting</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the imprinting is disrupted the maternal allele in the H19/Igf2 cluster behaves in the same way as the paternal allele i.e. expressing Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth factor, the resultant overdose of this protein predisposes to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA demethylation agents and acts by inhibiting the activity of the DNA methyltransferases. Decitabine acts as a cytosine analog. Once it is uptaken by the cell it will be incorporated into DNA instead of cytosine. When it is encountered by DNA methyltransferases it covalently binds and blocks them, thus preventing their normal function in methylating DNA. Since DNA demethylation occurs, it will also affect the tumor suppressor genes which may be inactivated via hypermethylation of CpG islands at their promoter regions. Then the hypomethylation may reactivate these tumor suppressor genes and have the desired anit-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, once established the DNA methylation pattern will persist in future generations of the cell lineage.</p>
<p>A period is sensitive when changes to DNA methylation can have an unpredictable effect on the underlying cells. These periods are associated with the erasure of parental and reestablishment of de novo DNA methylation patterns. In general there are two such period in the development of an organism:</p>
<p>The first is during early embrionic development between the zygote and blastocyst stages and the second is within the primordial germ cell development which starts in mid-gestation.</p>
<p>Since DNA methylation is heavily involved in genetic imprinting and gene expression control, introducing a substance that affects DNA methylation state in an uncontrolled and untargeted manner may have an unpredictable effect during the time when this state is transient and thus result in severe genetic disorders or unviability of a developing embryo. Thus it may be inadvisable to treat expectant mothers with these drugs as this may affect their pregnancy outcomes.</p>
