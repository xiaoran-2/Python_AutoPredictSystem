    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells often show a loss of imprinting, meaning that they should show mono-allelic parent-of-origin specific expression, but instead show either 1) expression from both maternal and paternal alleles or 2) no expression from either.  In a normal cell, the paternal allele imprint control region is methylated which blocks the binding of CTCF, and leads to the spread of DNA methylation to the H19 promoter, hence silencing that gene.  The downstream enhancers then have access to the Igf2 gene which they activate.  In a normal cell, the maternal allele imprint control region is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> methylated allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind to it, thus insulating Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  The enhancers then access the H19 gene to activate it.  In cells of the childhood kidney tumor known as Wilm’s tumor, the maternal imprint control region <span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> methylated, leading to the expression of Igf2.  Thus there is an overexpression of Igf2 (a growth promoter) since both the maternal and paternal alleles express the gene. This leads to tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and has been successfully used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (preleukemia).  As implied by the class name, it effects the epigenome by inhibiting methylation.  When the cell in question replicates, Decitabine, a nucleoside analog, is incorporated into the DNA.  Methyltransferases trying to add methyl groups to the daughter cell are irreversibly bound to the Decitabine, thus preventing the methylation of the daughter cell.  While DNMTi’s are not target specific, tumor cells replicate at a much higher rate than normal cells, and are thus more severely impacted.  Hypermethylated CpG islands indicate a poor prognosis in hematological malignancies, so it seems likely that Decitabine’s effect of inhibiting the methylation of CpG islands suppresses the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is mitotically heritable, i.e. daughter cells inherit DNA methylation from mother cells.  Methylation is symmetric around CpG, but as DNA replicates, it goes through a stage where the mother strand is methylated but the daughter strand is not.  DNMT1 methylates the daughter strand, completing the symmetry.  This occurs with each cell division, preserving the methylation.  If interrupted, subsequent replications lack methylation.  The opposite is also true, i.e. inducing methylation where it doesn’t exist is mitotically heritable.    </p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods</strong> occur when epigenetic reprogramming takes place: preimplantation development and primordial germ cell development.  Sperm and eggs have marks allowing them to perform their unique tasks, but once the zygote is formed, developing cells need complete totipotency to develop different tissue types.  Thus, the marks are removed.  As the zygote develops, marks are laid down for each tissue type.  When primordial germ cells are produced, these new marks must be removed to lay down the appropriate marks for eggs or sperm.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to <strong>treat patients</strong> during sensitive periods because treatments may disrupt these crucial stages of reprogramming by either inhibiting the establishment of marks, or by inhibiting the removal of marks prior to reprogramming.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, <strong>CpG island</strong>s are typically not methylated, while repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns typically are methylated.  Cancer cells exhibit the reverse, i.e. CpG islands are often methylated while the other regions often are not.   CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes which are active in normal cells.  Cancer cells exhibit CpG hypermethylation resulting in inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.  If this happens enough times, cancer may result.  Tumor cells have a competitive advantage by not having their growth suppressed, and, since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, the tumor cells can divide more quickly than normal cells. </p>
<p>DNA methylation of <strong>intergenic regions</strong> is believed to help maintain genomic stability, which is to say it prevents deletions, insertions, and duplications from occurring.  Such methylation can also silence cryptic start or splice sites which prevent transcriptional interference.  For example, if a gene is being transcribed in one direction, but a cryptic promoter starts transcription in the other direction, transcription of the desired gene will be disrupted when the two processes cross each other.  Methylation of the intergenic regions prevents this.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of <strong>repetitive elements</strong> is also thought to help maintain genomic stability.  Methylation can prevent transposition of long terminal repeats containing strong promoters.  This is important because the transposition of promoters may activate incorrect or incomplete genes.  The mutagenic effect of methylation converts C to T, which also helps to prevent transposition.  In addition to these genetic effects, methylation of repetitive elements can prevent transcriptional interference.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements that occurs in cancerous cells causes the genome to be destabilized and the chance for transcriptional interference to rise, both leading to disease.</p></div>
