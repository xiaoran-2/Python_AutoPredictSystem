    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands are important loci of the transcription initiation and modulation, normally located in the up-flunk regions of the genes or gene sets. The CpG islands are prevalently unmethylated in normal cells. Although the cancer genome is characterised by its overall hypomethylation, the CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands leads to the silencing of the genes regulated by them, which, in case of hitting (and decreasing the expression of) a tumor suppressor gene, can lead to cancer. Alternatively, the hypermethylation of the CpG island of a non-coding RNA that silences an oncogene can lead to its underexpression, hence an excess activity of an oncogene that can also cause cancer.</p>
<p>Unlike the state of the CpG islands, the normal cells are highly methylated at the intergenic, intronic and repetitive elements of their genome. Such hypermethylation ensures a tight packing of the structural part of the genome, ensures that the repetitive elements across different chromosomes are not mis-recognised as translocation sites, and protects the genome in a long timescale by supressing the transposons. The latter function is realised through the overall higher mutagenic activity of the methylated cytosine, which leads to the genomic mutation and inactivation of the transposonic regions in the genome throughout evolution.</p>
<p>The genomes of the cancerous cells are hypomethylated in their intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Such hypomethylation increases the overall exposure of the genome towards different transcription and epigenetic modulation enzymes, by converting the heterochromatin into euchromatin and increasing the expression of the silenced genes contained in the corresponding region. The hypomethylation of the repetitive elemens leads to chromosomal abberations, since different non-allelic matches and chromosomal translocations can occur, affecting the normal karyotype of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of the imprinted genes can result in either expression or silencing of those genes in both parental alleles, hence removing the differential allele-specific expression. The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele. Because of the methylation, the ICR is not recognised by the CTCF protein, which does not insulate the ICR. The exposed ICR silences the H19 gene, and the down-flank enhancers act on and activate the Igf2 gene. On contrary, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele. The unmethylated ICR is insulated by the ICR-recognising CTCF protein, because of which the down-flunk enhancers act on and increase the expression of the H19 gene only, while keeping Igf2 silent. The Wilm’s tumor is caused by the disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster imprinting, because of which the maternal allele is methylated too (hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster). This leads to the over-expression of the Igf2 gene (doubling of the dosage), which is known to have a growth stimulating function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat the myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine inhibits DNA-methyltransferases, hence preventing the methylation of the cytosines in the genome. This causes a hypomethylation and can lead to the increase and normalisation of the expressions of the tumor supressor genes, that were previosly down regulated because of the pathological hyper-methylation of the corresponding CpG islands. The revival of the tumor supressors can lead to the inhibition of the growth and the activation of the specific apoptosis mechanisms that would prevent the development and proliferation of the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decreasing the DNA methylation level can decrease the pathological hypermethylation of CGIs of the tumor supressor genes. Hence, such pharmacological hypomethylation can re-activate the tumor supressor genes, that would make the cancer cells to undergo apoptosis more readily. Furthermore, such changes will be mitotically inheritable, hence all the daughter cells of the affected ones will be equally prone to the programmed cell death and more susceptible to any agent that reduces the cell fitness, such as chemiotherapeutic agents. The epigenome affecting drugs, however, are not normally used in case there is a risk of an exposure to an organism that is in a sensitive period (pregnancy, puberty). Sensitive periods are the periods when the (epi)genome of the organism is especially suseptible to the epigenetic modulators, and, any small change can propagate further into a more fatal and pathological aberration for the organism. Such periods are the ones when the whole epigenetic information is erased and freshly rewritten, and includes the early embryonic development period and the development of the primordial germ cells. Any alteration of the epigenome in such periods can thus lead to major disruptions of imprinting and the normal epigenetic layout.</p></div>
