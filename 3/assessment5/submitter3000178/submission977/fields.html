    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms of epigenetics that regulates gene expression without a change in the DNA sequence.  In DNA methylation, a methyl group is covalently added to the 5-position of cytosine of the CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation has profound effects on transcriptional repression, chromatin structure modulation, X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and the suppression of the detrimental effects of repetitive and parasitic DNA sequences on genome integrity. About 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells are methylated except for the CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands, which are usually kept free of methylation. The CpG islands are found in most of the promoter regions of the genes. However, the methylation patterns of DNA are dramatically altered in cancer cells: the CpG islands are hypermethylated while the other methylated regions are demethylated. The hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands in cancer cells leads to silencing of associated genes including tumor suppressor genes, genes involved in cell-cell adhesion, and genes involved with DNA repair. These genes are involved in normal functioning of the cell, and suppression of them contributes to the uncontrolled growth and ineffective repair of genes. Furthermore, there is a loss of methylation of DNA at intergenic regions, and repetitive and parasitic elements of DNA (which are normally heavily methylated). The pathways for normal DNA demethylation that operate during differentiation or induction of certain physiological changes become hijacked during carcinogenesis and tumor progression, leading to the initiation of cancer-associated DNA demethylation. This demethylation then may spread in cis by both additional rounds of active demethylation and by passive demethylation involving failures in classical maintenance methylation and replication-associated repair methylation. The net result is an abnormal modulation of transcription and aberrant posttranscriptional processing of transcripts as well as increases in DNA recombination, thereby contributing to tumor formation and progression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>H19</em> and<em> IGF2 </em>are part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. <em>H19</em> is a noncoding RNA with properties that can suppress growth. <em>IGF2</em> codes for insulin-like growth factor 2 that enhances growth. The parentally inherited alleles of the two genes are differentially methylated: the imprint control region (ICR) of <em>H19</em>/<em>IGF2 </em>cluster of paternal chromosome is methylated, but not in the maternal chromosome. In normal somatic cells, hypomethylated maternally inherited ICR binds to an insulator protein CTCF, and blocks activity of Igf2 promoter by insulating it from its downstream enhancers. The <em>H19</em> gene is not silenced. In paternal allele, however, DNA methylation at ICR blocks CTCF binding and DNA methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence it and allow the downstream enhancers to access and activate<em> IGF2</em>. Therefore, only the maternal copy of <em>H19</em> and the paternal copy of <em>IGF2</em> are expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilms' tumor cells, loss of imprinting of the maternal chromosome and a switch to the paternal pattern of methylation is observed. This results in the overexpression of <em>IGF2</em> and reduced expression of <em>H19</em>. Because <em>H19</em> functions to slow cell growth and <em>IGF2</em> stimulates cell growth, loss of imprinting at the <em>H19</em>/<em>IGF2</em> locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation anomalies play a direct causal role in tumorigenesis. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and other cancer-related genes lead to silencing of these genes and tumor growth. The reversion of the hypermethylated state of these genes can therefore restore proliferation control and apoptosis sensitivity.  Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) can induce DNA demethylation and revert gene silencing.  Decitabine (2’-deoxy-5-azacytidine), which is a nucleoside analog, gets incorporated into DNA and binds to DNMT irreversibly and disables it to copy methylation to the daughter strand. These inhibitors are, therefore, non-specific and division dependent.  As cancer cell divides more rapidly than normal cells, the impact is more sever on cancer cells. Decitabine shows signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts at low and optimal doses. It is toxic at higher doses. Clinical studies have shown that tumor suppressor gene, which is hypermethylated in MDS and AML patients can be demethylated and reactivated in patients undergoing decitabine therapy. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Baylin and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine noted that some cancer patients who were treated with a combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor did not show much response to these drugs, but the same patients showed unexpectedly good response to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs in a follow-up study. This observation led to the speculation that the epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in these patients in some lasting way. This is possible because epigenetic changes are mitotically and/or meioticaly heritable.  This raises a big concern regarding the long term effects of the epigenetic drugs, although they appear to be well tolerated by cancer patients. Because these drugs can cause “lasting” changes to methylation patterns to cancer cells without killing them (and also to normal cells to lesser extent), we should be careful about treating younger patients with epigenetics drugs particularly during the sensitive periods of development. The sensitive periods include early embryonic development (pre-implantation and early post implantation) as well as periods of primodial germ cell development to production of mature gametes. Somatic maintenance period is less sensitive.  The environment can have most profound effect on epigenetic state of the organism during sensitive periods because epigenetic marks are actively modified during these periods.</p></div>
