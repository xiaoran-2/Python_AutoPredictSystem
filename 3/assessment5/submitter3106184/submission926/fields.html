    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, in general the CpG islands are hypomethylated. But in cancer cells, in general the CpG islands are hypermethylated. The CpG islands are generally found in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes, and these genes’ job is to stop the uncontrolled cell proliferation. So, when these CpG islands become hypermethylated, its results in silencing of associated gene. This silencing of tumor suppressor gene allows that particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues. And then over a period of time such cells are more likely to divide more rapidly, becomes immortal and can finally leads to cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand genome in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are in general heavily methylated in normal cells. This hypermethylation of these repeats inactivate these genes and also blocks recombination of these genes. However in cancer cells these repetitive elements and intergenic elements are hypomethylated. So these elements misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can occur because they are not densely packaged down into heterochromatin. This hypomethylation of these repeats also activates these repeats, so they can make a copy of themselves and may jump around the genome or transpose. And this transposition can results not only in the disruption of the coding region of a gene but also it may activate neighbouring genes. This results in transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions, and hence genomic instability, which finally ends up with cancer.       </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, so the CTCF4 an insulating protein can’t bind to insulate it. Because CTCF is not binding and there is no insulator action then enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2. And promote Igf2’s expression from the paternal allele. On the other hand these H19/Igf2 clusters of imprinted genes are unmethylated on the maternal allele. So when the imprint control region is unmethylated it is bound by insulator protein CTCF4 and insulates Igf2. In this case enhancers act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour due to loss of imprinting the imprint control region of the maternal allele is also highly methylated as paternal allele. So the maternal allele also show expression of Igf2 like paternal allele. This results in a double dose of Igf2 and because it is growth promoting, it leads to Wilm’s tumour.       </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which targets the epigenetic machinery belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a nucleoside analogue. So it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, then it copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. Thus blocking cell to replicate and divide. So the action of the drug decitabine is division dependent. Because cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than other normal cells in the body, they will be more severely affected. So when decitabine is given at low dose it show a very good anti-tumour effect and kills tumour cells.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. It is because we know that altering DNA methylation is an epigenetic change and epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. So epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.                                                              Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are called sensitive periods.  During sensitive period, clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in primordial germ cells development and preimplantation development takes place. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because it may results in epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting. And because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division so changes in primordial germ cells may cause severe disease in these patient’s progeny. </p></div>
