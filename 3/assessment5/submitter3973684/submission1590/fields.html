    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark where the cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide gets methylated to form 5-methyl cytosine. The cytosine in the both strands gets methylated, thus it is symmetrical and is maintained through cell division. DNA methylation often occurs at clusters of CpG dinucleotides called CpG islands which are often present at promoters of genes. Methylation at the CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression, whereas unmethylated CpG island results in expression of the gene in which it resides. Thus a same gene is not expressed in all the cell types. Eg: A gene for insulin will be unmethylated in beta cells of pancreas thus expressed, whereas that gene is methylated in all other cell types thus silenced.</p>
<p>The epigenetic machinery in a particular cell type ensures that only those genes that are need to be expressed are unmethylated. When this normal function of the cell disrupts, the genes are expressed or silenced abnormally. This is one of the cases encountered in Cancer. When the tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated, it gets silenced and can no longer guard the cell from cancer. Also the hypomethylation in the oncogenes results in over expression and lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. This varies with type of tumor.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in repetitive regions help in maintaining genomic integrity, preventing transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters(like LTR’s) and by preventing illegitimate recombination. When the methylation of repetitive DNA is affected, it loses the genomic stability thereby causing various disorders depending on the gene that is affected. Also, hypomethylation in intergenic regions or repeats will lead to cancer. Aberrant changes in DNA methylation at ICR’s causes loss of imprinting which in turn leads to various disorders.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">For most genes, both the maternal and paternal copies are active. But the imprinting genes have parent of origin specific expression. They exist in clusters whose expression is controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at ICR. But this does not correlate with gene silencing.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster is an example for imprinting genes. In this cluster, only the paternal copy is active. In the maternal copy, ICR is unmethylated, causing expression of H19. Also it allows binding of CTCF that insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. In paternal copy, the ICR is methylated and blocks CTCF binding. This causes methylation spreading to H19 promoter and silences it, allowing enhancers to activate Igf2. Thus Igf2 gets expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Loss of imprinting by mutations or uniparental disomy, causes either overexpression or silencing of the particular gene. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele. Thus in H19/Igf2 cluster, both alleles become active causing overexpression of Igf2. The Igf2 is an oncogene, codes for a growth stimulating harmone. Upregulation of Igf2 therefore causes cancer, which is a case in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a disease caused by alterations in epigenetics and parallel genetic mutations. Targeting DNA for therapy is not yet practical, hence recent research focuses on repairing the epigenome. Epigenetic regulators can be easily targeted since most of them are enzymes which can be inhibited by small molecules. Decitabine is a one such epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT). DNMT1 is an enzyme that methylates DNA. DNA methylation is a sign of gene silencing. Thus hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) leads to decreased expression resulting in cancer. Decitabine is a class of nuceloside analogues that can irreversibly bind DNMTs and inhibit their action. Thus the TSGs will get expressed protect the cell from cancer. Decitabine is thus an FDA approved drug that has found to work on cancer cells leaving normal cells unaffected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Cancer is a disease caused by alterations in epigenetics and parallel genetic mutations. Most of the cancers are associated with alterations in methylation patterns like hypermethylation of Tumor Supressor Genes and hypomethylation of Oncogenes, repetitive elements etc. These epigenetic alterations can be targeted for therapy. The epigenetic drugs can be effective because the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. Thus the treatment can have long lasting effects and can be passed on to generations.</p>
<p>Since the epigenetic marks are incorporated during cell division, care should be taken to avoid treating the patients in sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are those when epigenetic reprogramming occurs i.e. when marks are being established rather than maintained. These include periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, the marks have to be established. Treating the patients with epigenetic drugs like DNMT inhibitors during sensitive periods can therefore affect the entire methylation pattern resulting in severe genetic abnormalities. Thus the physicians should be cautious about the age group of the patient prior treating with epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
