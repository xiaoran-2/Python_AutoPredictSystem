    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands in normal cell would be regulated and maintained in an appropriate expression in the inner cell environment. Once the methylations lecel enhanced, it can be appeared in two ways, </strong><br /><strong>(i)Locus specific DNA hypermethylation, it is mainly occur in promoter CpG islands and CpG shores of tumour suppressor genes like p14, p16, PTEN, etc.</strong><br /><strong>(ii) Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation happens in CpG poor promoters and the DNA repetitive regions to activate oncogenes. </strong><br /><strong>“Global hypomethylation” due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement. Moreover, if imprinting control region is loss, it could happen in both hypo- or hyper- methylation in certain genes.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cancer has abnormal methylation then normal cell. But, the regulations on DNA methylation contribute not exactly clear, the plenty of pathways it might be involved</strong><br /><strong>(i) histone and/or proteins such as EZH2 altered genes expression; </strong><br /><strong>(ii) small RNA(s) and/or lncRNA(s) target genes regulation; </strong><br /><strong>(iii)outer particle(s) affect on microRNAs and other epigenetic alterations, for instance, chromatin conformation, translocation and histone modification.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Last but not least, normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands, it mainly hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic integrity, such as silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition and may prevent illegitimate recombination.For instance, methylated DNMT1 in null cells can enhance the genomic stability. </strong><br /><strong>By contrast, In cancer cell, DNA methylation in intergenic regions not only hypomethylated but also trigger deletions, Insertions and reciporocal translocations in genome.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To sum up, DNA methylation in normal cell trying to keep “healthy”, in cancer, DNA methylation to maintain the cells enable to continuous growth up.</strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>The epigenome of cancer cell displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. It changes can passed on during cell division to its next generations. It cannot returned unless they actively erased. The mechanism of epigenetic changes unlike gene regulation, for instance, they involved transcriptional factors. Therefore, if we can change tumours’ epigenome to its normal cell function. Hence, the effects of the drugs can be continue its function after you stop taking it.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br /><strong>Sensitive period is a period during postnatal development, which is heightened sensitivity to environmental inferences. Treating with patients during this period of development can influence DNA methylation patterns of several genesincoulding "good genes". Because that is an early period of the whole development, using epigenetic drugs to alter the inner regulation environment, could have a long term effect and irreversible in the patients development and its regulations. Hence, it should be used epigenetic drugs to treat in the sensitive period.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine (5-aza′-2-deoxycytidine) is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase through p53-independent pathway in human cancer cells. EMEA and FDA approved Decitabine for treat with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and low-blast count acute myelogenousleukemia (AML). Using <strong>Decitabine  can </strong>improve the survival of patients with these diseases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moreover, research discovered that p15 promoter hypermethylation in AML and MDS patients contribute 68% and 35% respectively. The hypermethylation level correlate with the progression of MDS patients. </strong><strong>The effect of Decitabine induced by dose-dependent demethylation in some cancer marker genes such as MLH1, RASSF1A, HOXA10 and HOXA11.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low dosage of DNMTi can activate the silent genes because of DNA methylation, restore normal terminal differentiation, senescence or apoptosis. High dosage of Decitabine leads to DNA damage and DNA synthesis arrest in cell, incudce cytotoxicity and cell death, However, high dosage of DNMTi may affects normal cells' death as well.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p0"><strong>Genomic imprinting is a monoallelic gene expression, it is only one allele in pair of gene can be expressed.  An allele specific expression is based on parent-of-origin of the allele. For instance, if paternal allele is expressed, then the maternal copy is silenced.</strong></p>
<p class="p0"><strong>Take H19/lgf2 for a tapical example in genomic imprinting.

<p class="p0"><strong>To conclude, lossing the imprinting in H19/lgf2 cluster can 1-fold up-regulated l</strong><strong>gf2, without H19 regulation, lgf2 become an oncogene, function in growth promoting.</strong></p></div>
