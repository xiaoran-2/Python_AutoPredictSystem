    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal genome, CpG islands tend to be hypomethylated and are part of the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes.This hypomethylation then keeps the promoter region active and thereby activates tumour supressor genes. These genes are essential for preventing the further growth of any tumours that occur.</p>
<p>In cancer, this normal hypomethylation is altered and there is hypermethylation of both CpG islands and the bases immediately around the islands (island shores).</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores then results in inactivation of the promoter regions of tumour supressor genes. These genes are no longer active allowing cancer cells to replicate unchecked.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the other hand, the normal state is one of hypermethylation. This keeps these regions and elements inactive and is necessary for genomic stability because an active repetitive element can replicate or jump around the genome causng disruptions to other genes. It can also activate neighbouring genes and increase the frequency of errors like insertions, deletions or translocations in the chromosomes. Hypermethylation keeps these inactive and keeps the genome stable.</p>
<p>In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>This means that they now become active and because of that active sate they can jump around the genome and increase the frequnecies of errors like deletion or translocation in the chromosomes. Sometimes these repetitive elements also activate certain genes which can further predispose the cell to turn into a malignant cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of a group of drugs that inhibit the action of the enzyme DNA methyl transferase (DNMT).</p>
<p>DNMT is required for methylation of DNA of the daughter cells during cell division so that the epigenetic marks of the original cell remain in the daughter cells after mitosis.Decitabine acts by preventing this action of DNMT. It irreversibly binds to DNMT and prevents it from acting. Therefore DNA methylation during cell division fails to occur. As a result of this, daughter cells have hypomethylated DNA.</p>
<p>This is therapeutically important in some kinds of cancer where the primary driver of the cancer or tumour is hypermethylation of a particular area of the genome. In such cases, Decitabine inhibits DNMT during cell division of the cancer cells and the daugther cells show decreased methylation of the particular areas of the genome and there is consequent decrease in gene expression and the cancer is halted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable in somatic cells i.e.any changes made to the methylation status of the DNA in a cell will be passed on to the daughter cells after cell division. Thus a change in DNA methylation endures through subsequent generations in the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one in which epigenomic changes occur - exisitng epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, acetylation etc) are removed or wiped clean and new epigenetic marks are created. Any factor (environmental or otherwise) has a maximum capacity to alter the epigenome durng this period. </p>
<p>In humans the first sensitive period occurs during pre-implantation i.e. from the time of fertilisation (zygote formation) upto implantation (where the zygote has divided to form a blastocyst). Another is during germ cell formation and maturation, which essentially occurs through intra-uterine life and upto just before the onset of puberty. Individual tissues also have sensitive periods depending on the organ they are part of and the developmental schedule of that organ or organ system.</p>
<p>Since epigenetic marks are being laid down during sensitive periods, any drug administered then has the potential to alter the epigenome both for the lifetime of that individual and to affect future generations through germ cell epigenome alterations. So treating patients during sensitive periods is generally inadvisable.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal state, the paternal allele is methylated at the Imprint Control Region (ICR). This methylation blocks binding of insulator protein CTCF to it and consequently methylation now spreads to the H19 promoter region thereby silencing it. Enhancers which lie downstream of H19 can now act on Igf2 and activate it resulting in an increased expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, there is no methylation of the ICR and so CTCF can bind to it. This means there is an active H19 promoter and this results in the downstream enhancers acting on H19 and not on Igf2. So Igf2 expression is decreased.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is paternal uniparental disomy. Both alleles behave like a paternal allele and there is methylaton of the ICR in both. Consequent methylation of H19 and silencing occurs and the downstream enhancers now act on Igf2 in both chromosomes significantly increasing its expression.</p>
<p>Increased levels of Igf2 cause increased growth of renal tissue as Igf2 is a growth promoter. Increased growth results in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>
