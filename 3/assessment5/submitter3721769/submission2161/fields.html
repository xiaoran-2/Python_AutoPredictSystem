    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group, and occurs nearly exclusively at the cysteine residue where cysteine is adjacent to guanine. De novo methylation is laid down by methyltransferase enzymes DNMT3a and 3b, while methylation is maintained, in particular following cell division, by DNMT1.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to repress gene expression by silencing the promoter region of the gene. This is primarily achieved by recruitment of factors that result in a repressive chromatin structure. Another mechanism is by preventing transcription factor binding.</p>
<p>CpG islands have been found to be frequently hypermethylated in cancer, resulting in silencing of the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Suppression of TSGs by methylation may be one of the ‘hits’ required in Knudsen’s two-hit hypothesis of cancer, resulting in unrestricted growth of the tumour. In addition, hypermethylation of the Imprint Control Regions, leading to loss of imprinting, may result in expression of growth-promoting genes, as occurs in Wilms tumours due to Igf2 overexpression.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. At intergenic regions, methylation prevents abnormal rearrangements of genetic material. At repetitive elements, methylation silences repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promotors. Methylation of repeats may also prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation has been detected, and this may result in hypomethylation of repeats and / or intergenic regions. This would result in increased illegitimate recombination between repeats and transpositions, leading to abnormal deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions and overall genomic instability. One result may be activation of cryptic promoters, resulting in activation of oncogenes. Oncogene activation by hypomethylation is demonstrated in human Immuno-Craniofacial syndrome, where mutation of DNMT3B results in widespread hypomethylation and tumour formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of H19/Igf2, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, thereby blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein. In the absence of CTCF, methylation spreads to the H19 promoter which is silenced. The downstream enhancers are then free to access and activate Igf2.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing binding of CTCF, and allowing expression of H19 promoter. The downstream enhancers are then able to access H19, but do not activate Igf2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wilms’ tumours are part of the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome where there is loss of imprinting. The maternal allele, instead of being unmethylated with no Igf2 expression, behaves like the paternal allele. The result is that both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated at the ICR of H19/Igf2, with over-expression of Igf2 and hence unrestricted growth of organs and tumours. There are several abnormalities at the H19/Igf2 cluster known to be associated with Wilms’ tumours including: mutation or deletion, causing loss of im printing, uniparental disomy (resulting in two paternal alleles) or, rarely, epigenetic disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of hypomethylating agents that results in widespread DNA hypomethylation. This may have an anti-tumour effect by reducing hypomethylation at tumour suppressor genes, allowing the re-activation of normal TSGs, and therefore limiting tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has been demonstrated to be mitotically heritable, therefore altherations to methylation may endure long after the stimulus has been applied.</p>
<p>A ‘sensitive period’ in the context of epigenetics is one where there is widespread re-programming of epigenetics, such as during early development (pre-blastocyst) and primodial germ cell development.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> </span></p>
<p>Treating patients with agents that alter epigenetics during a sensitive period may disrupt key normal events, such as the development of lineage-specific epigenetic marks and the process of X-inactivation in females. This may result in unpredictable clinical problems, such as those foretold by the issues experienced in cloning and somatic cell reprogramming.</p></div>
