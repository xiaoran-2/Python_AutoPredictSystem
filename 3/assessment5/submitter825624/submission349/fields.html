    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island is the modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base when it occurs as CpG dinucleotide in the DNA, leading to gene silencing. 60% of promoters have high CpG islands, which are normally kept free of methylation. In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated, causing silencing of the underlying gene. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as those that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair, leads to cells that proliferate without control, do not undergo apoptosis, and accumulate DNA mutations without DNA repair, all of which leads to cancer development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions are repetitive elements which are normally methylated. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This leads to genomic instability and cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demythylating agents. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. They can have an anti-tumour effect by reactivating tumor suppressor genes that were silenced by methylation in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele of H19 is methylated silenced (i.e. imprinted), which leads to expression of Igf2. The maternal allele of H19 is unmethylated expressed, which leads to silencing of Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 is disrupted via selective loss of maternal and reduplication of paternal chromosome 11p15.5 alleles. This leads to a bipaternal epigenotype at these loci, with H19 inactive and IGF2 biallelically active, the latter serving as a potent oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because these changes can be transmitted to daughter cells. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. The first week of life after birth is a sensitive period of development in which epigenetic modifications in response to maternal care occurs. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs can interfere with normal cells that are undergoing adaptive epigenetic modifications.</p></div>
