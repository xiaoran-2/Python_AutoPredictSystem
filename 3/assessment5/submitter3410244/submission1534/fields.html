    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The <span>function of DNA methylation at CpG islands normally causes silencing of gene expression, especially for ensuring those at inactive X chromosomes. In the case of cancer, these CpG islands are to be hypermethylated where they are methylated  when they should not be. This will cause genomic instability with illegitimate deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, and even duplication of chromosomes or loss of chromosomes. Silencing the tumor suppressor genes is the main cause of cancer. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation occurs more frequent than mutation and progresses with time but confounded by increasing with age. Some examples are RB in retinoblastoma, and BRAC1 in breast cancer. Moreover, in the case of hypermethylation in CpG islands of a set of genes, it can be associated with clinically different tumors. Further more, it was discovered recently that hypermthylation at CpG island shores also correlates with gene expression.</span></p>
<p>For DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the normal function is to protect the genome from transposable elements and maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, these  intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated, hence, hypomethylation occurs genome-wide which also leads to genomic instability. Depends on locations, consequence includes Repears and CpG poor promoters which leads to oncogene activation and result in activation of genes such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. Hence, causing human disease, such as mutations in DNMT3B resuls in ICT syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It was known that changes in DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs), no matter it's hypomethylation or hypermethylation, can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or overexpression of groeth promoting genes, hence, loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Looking at the case of lGF2 H19 cluster, for normal cells, the ICR is methylated at the paternal allele, the enhacers will act on lgf2, IGF2 is expressed. While the ICR is unmethylated at the maternal allele, the enhancers will act on H19 but the lgf2 will be silent. hence no expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, with loss of imprinting, hypermethylation of ICR in both patrernal and maternal alleles. Comparing with the case normal cell, the maternal allele also has expression of lgf2. So, there will be double dose of lgf2. As igf2 is growth promoting, and this associates with Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to "histone-deacetylase inhibitor" or "demthylating" agents. It works by demethylation of DNA, normal function of the tumour suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic grugs altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because, unlie other forms of gene regualtion, epigentic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaugther cells until they are actively erased. There are some periods of develpment when we have to avoid treating patients with these drugs, called "Sensitive Periods". Sensitive period is defined as the period for a patient to expose to a drug. <span>These </span><em>sensitive periods</em><span> present unique opportunities to affect healthy </span><em>development</em><span>. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as the patients are exposed to the drug and the side effect is not known while it is in the market with the first few years.</span></p></div>
