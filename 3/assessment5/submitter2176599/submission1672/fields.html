    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation plays several roles in controling of gene expression in normal cells and disruptions in the cell epigenome can lead to diseases such cancer.  CpG islands, which are found in gene promoters and are rich in CpG dinucleotides, tend to be demethylated within the normal cell genome, regardless of expression status of it's adjacent gene. In cancer these regions seems to be hypermethylated, inactivating genes such as tumor supressor genes, which are responsible for curb cell proliferation and tumor progression. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are usually methylated in normal cells, provinding genome stability in this cells. When these sequences are demethylated in a cancer cell, genome instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer, is stabilished, allowing for mutations and chromossomic rearrangements characteristcs for some types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once the genetic imprinting controls the dosage of some genes such as growth factors or tumor supressor genes,disruption of this control can lead to cancer development. An example is given by the H19/Igf2 gene. This gene is paternally imprited, meaning that the paternal allele is methylated in it's ICR. This methylation preclude CTCF, an insulator protein, binding on ICF (which occurs on the unmethylated maternal allele). In the absence of CTCF binding enhacers activate Igf2 (a oncogene, responsible for cell proliferation), so this growth factor is expressed only in the paternal allele. In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is also methylated, which blocks the CTCF binding on it. So there are a overexpression of the growth factor (oncogene) Igf2, leading to Wilm's tumor development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine acts inhibiting the enzime DNA methyltransferase . This drug has been used succesfully in the treatment of Myelodyplastic syndrome, one type of hematologic malignancy . By inhibit DNAMT this drug decreases the DNA methylation and consequently the methylation of CpG islands of tumor supressor genes, which is observed in cancer cells. Decitabine is also classified as a antimetabolic chemoterapy, a class of drugs which are very similar to normal substances found within the cell. These drugs interact with several components of the cell producing toxic metabolites, which causes cell death in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable, so alterations in one cell could pass to the daughter cells after cell division. there are periods in humen development called sensitve periods. These periods are periods when cells are reprograming it's epigenome by deleting epigenetic marks and adding it again. Gametogenesis and embrionic development are sensitive periods in human developement. Treating women could induce infeasibility of the fetus if it is in a sensitive period, or disrupt the gametogenesis in development in a female fetus, for example.</p></div>
