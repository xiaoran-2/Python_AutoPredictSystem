    <h1>Submission 696 from Anon (session_user_id: a4a25d84034e9b7e13e22561c347a1492971f3fc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a cytidine analog, which belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">When Decitabine instead of cytosin is incorporated into DNA during the DNA replication, it irreversibly traps DNA methyltransferases by forming covalent complexes. This inhibits propagation of DNA methylation during each round of replication and leads to hypermethylation of DNA in dividing cells.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Tumor cells are fast proliferated cells with hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes (silenced mark). Loss of DNA methylation in cancer cells (caused by Decitabine) results in re-expression of<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>pathologically silenced tumor suppressors, decrease of proliferation or even in induction of senescence or apoptosis of these cells.</span></p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation occurs mainly in cytidine residues and is mitoticaly heritable. CpG islands are found in promoter regions of genes. In normal "healthy" cells these CpG islands (as well as regulatory sequences such as enhancers) tend to be unmethylated (which means that genes are expressed). When they are methylated, genes are silenced. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Methylated regions of genome are normally found in intrones of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic stability (silencing of transposomes, preventing from illegitimate recombination).</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In contrast, cancer cells show aberrant DNA methylation. The global level of DNA methylation in tumor cells is decreasing in time (genome-wide hypomethylationn of intrones, intergenic regions and repetitive elements). Thanks to hypomethylation, these regions are no longer densely packaged down into heretochromatine, therefore became active and jumping of transposomes and illegitimate recombination of repeats can occur, which together cause genome instability.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">On the other hand, there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells, such as hypermethylation of CpG islands in comparison to normal cells (especially in promoters of tumor suppressor genes).<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>This results in silencing of these genes and it is known, that inactivation of tumor suppressors as well as oncogene activation could lead to<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>uncontrolled cell division, accumulation of DNA damage, preventing from cell death and eventually to cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In normal cells imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. Unmethylated ICR is able to bind insulator protein, which prevent from interaction of distance enhancers with Igf2 promoter (this causes silencing of egf2 expression) and enable the interaction of these enhancers with H19 promoter and enhanced its expression. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">When ICR is methylated (paternal allele in normal cells) insulator protein cannot be bind to ICR and can no longer block interaction of enhancers with igf2 promoter, which cause expression of igf2 protein. Methylation from ICR spreads to H19 promoter (silencing of H19).</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">However, in cancer cells there is often found loss of imprinting, caused by alternation in DNA methylation of imprinting genes (hypo as well as hyper-methylation of imprint control regions). In Wilm's tumor ICR on both alleles (paternal as well as maternal) are hypermethylated, therefore growth promoting igf2 protein is expressed from both allele (double dose in comparison to normal cell). </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Growth promoting proteins act like oncogenes (opposite to tumor suppressor), so ever-expression of igf2 leads to increased cell division and decreased cell death -signs associated with induction of cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitoticaly heritable, thanks to DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which is maintenance methyltransferase. It predominantly methylates hemimethylated DNA (one strand is already methylated - template strand, and second is unmethylated - newly synthesized strand after DNA replication).</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, when the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occur. This period is very sensitive to environmental signals and changes. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are germ cells development (prenatal development and from adolescence in women, from adolescence in men) and also and pre-implantation development of fetus - pregnancy of women.</p>
<p>Because these drugs are not targeted only to tumor cells, they also alter epigenetic of other dividing cells. The treatment of patients in their sensitive periods (during their prenatal development and when their germ cells are developed) shoul be carefully considered, because these drug-induced epigenetic alterations in germ cells could cause problems with conception, fetal development or be passed to progeny. </p></div>
