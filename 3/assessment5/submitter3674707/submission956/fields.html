    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Methylation of CpG islands at promoters of genes leads to gene silencing. </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">CpG methylation in promoters of tumour suppressor genes </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">results in their silencing and is mitotically inheritable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Tumour suppressor genes code for proteins that inhibit cell division. Their silencing causes inappropriate cell survival. Epimutations are reversible. There can be DNA-hypomethylation at CpG poor promotors  which can lead to the activation of previously inactive genes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA-methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements help to maintain genomic stability. DNA methylation in these regions also results in the silencing of cryptic transcription sites. Expression form these sites may be antisense. If this gene is not silenced there may be transcriptional interference. Intergenic regions may contain cryptic splice sites which contain a DNA sequence that is recognised by the splicing machinery. Without sliencing, inappropriate splicing may lead to the loss/truncation of the exons in a gene.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Repetitive elements of a gene tend to make copies of themselves and jump around the genome. This is very mutagenic as it may disrupt other genes and/or their expression. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Genetic recombination only occurs between homologous chromosome due their areas of genetic identity. It doesn't occur elsewhere due to the formation of heterochromatin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer cells and is mitotically inheritable and leads to genomic instability. It could </span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;color:#0084d1;">lead to transcription at cryptic sites which may lead to transcription interference.          </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Hypomethylation can cause in chromosomal deletions (e.g a tumour suppressor gene), chromosomal insertion which could disrupt a gene or place a gene next to strong promoter which will increase its expression activation of an oncogene. The loss of DNA-methylation of repeats could lead to illegitimate recombination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The resultant of products or lack thereof can lead to aberrant cell behaviour seen in cancer. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the paternal allele the H19/Igf2 cluster has its imprint control region (ICR) methylated. This stops the binding of an insulator protein called CTCF to the ICR. When CTCF is not bound H19 cannot be expressed; the enhancers are then free to act on the expression of the Igf2 gene instead leading to its expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the maternal allele of the H19/Iff2 cluster has its ICR unmethylated. This allows the CTFC protein being able to bind to the ICR which allows the enhancers to act on the H19 gene which leads to its expression. Consequently the enhancers are no longer free to act on the Igf2 and the it is not expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In Wilm's tumour the imprint control regions of both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated. This leads to Igf2 being overexpressed as it is expressed from both alleles. This also leads to the total lack of expression of the H19 on both alleles; thus the gene product is missing completely.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The product of the Igf2 gene is growth promoting and thus leads to the proliferation of cells. This effect is amplified as the their is double the about of Igf2 being expressed.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylation agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Decitabine acts by removing the methyl group from </span></span><span style="color:#0084d1;">5-methyl cytosine and thus leads to DNA hypomethylation. This would have the effect of reactivating previously silenced genes</span></span></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to </span></span><a href="http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15391"><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">genes</span></span></span></a><span style="color:#0084d1;"> </span><span style="color:#0084d1;"><span style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation such as the tumour suppressor genes, and those involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death). The hypomethylation may also result in the restoration of imprinted genes where the ICRs have become wrongly methylated due epimutation during tumorogenesis. This would, for example prevent the overexpression of Igf2 found in Wilm's tumour.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Using demethylation agents has a lasting effect on the genome because DNA methylation is maintained during mitosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">A sensitive period in epigenetics is when the the environment may have an affect on the epigenetic makeup as this is when active epigenetic remodelling occurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The first sensitive period is in the preimplantation embryo. The second is during primordial germ cell development;  through to the production of mature gametes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During preimplantation DNA methylation is removed (except in imprinted genes and repeats) and then re-added. The constant methylation of repeats prevents genomic instability during development. If administered; a demethylation agent at this stage of pregnancy would result in abnormal growth of the embryo, genomic instability and a loss of gene imprinting.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0084d1;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During primordial germ cell development, with the exception of the repeats, are remodelled via demethylation and 're-methylation'. It would be inadvisable to administer a demethylation agent during this period because it could to lead genomic instability due to the lack of methylation the repeats. It results in hypomethylation of germ cells. This leads to the loss of imprinted genes. This hypomethylation could result in the infertility of the next generation. This zygote would probably be non-viable </span></p>
