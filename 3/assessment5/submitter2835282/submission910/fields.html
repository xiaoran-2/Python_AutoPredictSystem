    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered and decreases genome-wide with cancer progression. The usual alterations in DNA methylation are locus specific CpG islands hypermethylation, abnormal genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Another general feature is loss of imprinting; this feature can be associated either with DNA hypomethylation or DNA hypermethylation.</p>
<p>CpG islands are specific CG-rich DNA sequences in promoter region of some genes. They are generally found in the promoters of the so-called tumor suppressor genes, whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. In healthy cells CpG islands are normally hypomethylated and therefore these genes are active. On the contrary, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated in cancer cells and tumour suppressor are locked in a silence inactive status. As a consequence, transformed cells have an advantage because they divide more rapidly or die not as easily, therefore they will take over. In addition these kinds of epimutations are heritable during mitosis; this gives a competitive advantage to the daughter cells over normal cells.</p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and repetitive elements are DNA sequences that made up most of the human genome. In healthy cells these DNA regions are hypermethylated. So that, this elements are blocked in order to avoid illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, activation of transposons, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated. Consequently, these elements can be activated inducing aberrant deletions, aberrant insertions or abnormal chromosome reciprocal translocations. Accumulation of these alterations creates chromosome instability.</p>
<p>Each cancer type and subtype shows a specific set of alterations in the DNA methylation status. These DNA methylation profiles can be used as biomarkers to differentiate cell growth from transformed growth or for prognosis of outcome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) has been shown most effective in myelodysplastic syndrome because it seem to be dependent on abnormal CpG island hypermethylation. Treatment with Decitabine seems to be adequate because it acts as a DNA-demethylating agent. This inhibitor was toxic in high concentrations, had terrible side effects and was nonspecific. Actual treatments are based in lower doses and show specific anti-neoplastic effect; for instance, myelodysplastic syndrome patients treated with this drug tolerate it extremely well and they have  superior life expectancy and better quality of life.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, cells incorporate Decitabine in the newly synthesized DNA upon division. When the DNA-methyltransferase 1 (DMT1) copies the epigenetic mark in the daughter DNA strand that contains this inhibitor, it binds irreversible. Upon several rounds of replication, CpG islands might get hypomethylated. Cancer cells are more severely affected by the inhibitor because they divide more rapidly (assimilate more inhibitor) than normal cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Another general feature in carcinogenesis is loss of parent-of-origin-specific expression (imprinting). Epimutations can be associated either with DNA hypomethylation or DNA hypermethylation depending on each imprint control region (ICR). Genes related with imprinting are often involved in growth, either promoting or suppressing.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of an ICR, enhancer elements and two genes: H19 (a tumour suppressor gene) and Igf2 (a oncogene). The enhancer elements activate a single gene in each allele.</p>
<p>In healthy cells, maternal ICR is unmethylated and interacts with the protein CTCF (insulator element). This interaction makes that the enhancer elements activate the H19 gene. On the paternal allele, the ICF region is methylated by imprinting; methylation spreads to the neighboring H19 promoter region that is consequently inactivated. In this allele, enhancers act over the Igf2 promoter region, which gene is subsequently expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is loss of imprinting. The maternal ICR is hypermethylated and therefore expression is like in the paternal allele. As a result, there is no expression of the tumour suppressor H19 gene and a double dose of the growth promoting gene Igf2 expression. Disregulation between growth promoting and suppressing genes might contribute to early stages of carcinogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in mammals occur almost exclusively CpG dinucleotides (p means phosphate). This methylated dinucleotide meCpG present symmetry from the other DNA strand. DMNT1 transfers the me-group to the daughter DNA strand (CpGme) during mitosis in somatic cells. This allows the cell to have epigenetic memory.</p>
<p>Certain compounds are able to change the general DNA methylation status of the cell. This might be positive and they are used as a treatment against certain transformed cells. However, healthy cells are exposed to the drug and might incorporate alterations of DNA methylation status, which will be transferred to their daughter cells as well.</p>
<p>This fact might not represent a severe problem by treating elderly patients. However, younger patients have cells that are in epigenetic reprogramming stages (so called sensitive periods): women carrying a fetus in early development or  primordial germ cells of young people. This cells are sensitive because they have to be reprogram to create a new human being.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the consequences are unknown. DNA methylation status can be abnormal in these cells and these alterations, for instant in fetus, will probably affect all the cell of the new human being because of the epigenetic memory.</p></div>
