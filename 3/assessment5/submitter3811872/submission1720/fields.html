    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hipometillated while the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions are metillated. In cancer cells, the opposit situation happens, the CpG islands are metillated while the others are not. When the promotor of a tumor suppressor gene is disrupted, the promotor is inactivated and the gene won't be expressed. This means that the suppressors of tumors won't make their job, leading to the developments os a cancer. This, thoug, is not enough. The hipometillation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have a roule too. When the affected regions belong to an oncogene, the fact that there is no metillation leads to an activation of that gene. Because of its nature, the activated oncogene leads to the development of a cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethiylating agent. This means that it removes the methylation of the histons and therefore activates what was inhibited.When we apply Decitabine in a cancer cell where the tumour suppressor gene is methylated, in other words inactivated, the methylation will be removed and the gene will regain its function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When we alter DNA methylation, those alterations are mitotically heritable, so they pass to the new generation and eventually , all the cells will have that change. A sensitive periode is a periode when the environmente can influence epigenetic marks. In mamals, the sensitive periods are two. One is the period of the primordial germ cells development through the production of mature gametes and the second is the period of pre-implantation and early post-implantation. Those are sentitive periods due to the active remodeling of the epigenetic marks. If we treated patients during the sensitive periods, we would be chanching the epigenetic marks of not only the patient but also it progeny.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated on the imprinted control region and the maternal allele is not. As this occurs, the CTCF can't bind to the imprinted control region in the paternal allele because it's methylated. It binds to the maternal and allows H19 to be expressed. In the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR leads to the methylation of the promoter of H19 and promotes the enhancers to activate Igf2 that is inactive in the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, the imprintig is disrupted. There's an hypermethylation of the ICR of the maternal allele, which means that there will be twice as much Igf2 as in a normal cell. As the igf2 is a growth promoter, it leads to the formation of a tumour.</p></div>
