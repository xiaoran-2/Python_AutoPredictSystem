    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides, called CpG islands, occurs when a methyl group is added. Cytosine is methylated at CpG islands in a symmetrical fashion, and the methylation is maintained by DNMT1. When cell division occurs, the methylation will be copied by DNMT1 and the daughter cell will be fully methylated, producing a stable epigenetic mark. Methylation at CpG islands is almost universally silencing to genes.</p>
<p>When cancer occurs, methylation at CpG islands becomes more dense in a progressive manner as the cancer worsens. This process, called hypermethylation, can also spread to surrounding regions known as CpG island shores. CpG island hypermethylation can also occur in sets of genes in cancer, with distinct sets differing by tumour type.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to disease by silencing tumour suppressor genes. It occurs frequently in tumours, is mitotically heritable, and the epimutations are rapidly selected.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. This helps to maintain genomic integrity. Without DNA methylation in intergenic regions, abnormalities can occur, like extra chromosomes, chromosomes swapping pieces, or deletions of part of a chromosome. DNA methylation silences repetitive elements, helping to prevent disfunctions such as transposition, and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetivive elements are in general hypomethylated. This causes genomic instability. Chromatin becomes more open, and abnormalities can occur, such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighboring genes. This instability can contribute to disease, with hypomethylation enhancing tumourigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster. This blocks binding of the protein CTCF, allowing downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, which results in expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, and Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, causing Igf2 to be abnormally expressed. In this case, then, Igf2 is expressed on both the maternal and paternal alleles, providing a double dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to disease because Igf2 is a growth promotor. This double dose of a growth promoter leads to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Decitabine causes DNA demethylation by irreversibly binding DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect by freeing tumour suppressor genes since some haematological malignancies are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. Currently Decitabine is in use to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome by causing marks to be activating or silencing. Hypomethylation would result in a more open chromatin structure and a more active epigenome. Hypermethylation would result in more tightly compacted chromatin and a more silenced epigenome. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these would be lasting effects.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times of epigenetic reprogramming. These occur in early embryonic development and during gametogenesis, or primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods could upset the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Treatment of young patients may be inadvisable because of potential effects to germ cells.</p></div>
