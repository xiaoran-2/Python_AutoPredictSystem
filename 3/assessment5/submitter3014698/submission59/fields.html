    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are hypomethylated, resulting in gene expression. Multiple hits to the DNA can result in cancer. In cancer cells, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation occurs at CpG islands. This DNA hypermethylation causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes and results in one hit to the DNA. Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable each daughter cell will exhibit similar silencing of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in uncontrolled abnormal cell growth. CpG island hypermethylation is useful for diagnosis, prognosis, as well as treatment information. For example, having a CIMP phenotype typically results in better prognosis. Hypermethylation can also occur at CpG island shores. Imprint control regions can be either hypomethylated or hypermethylated, which leads to either loss of growth restriction genes or overepression growth promoting genes, respectively. This is caused by a loss of parent of origin monoallelic expression.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, genomic stability is maintained by DNA hypermethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements,. In cancer cells, genome wide DNA hypomethylation occurs at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. Most commonly the hypomethlyation occurs at repetitive elements causing genomic instability. This genomic instablility can be caused by illegitimate recombination between repeats. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can lead to oncogene activation and expression.</p>
<p>Both DNA methylation at CpG islands and DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements can increase with tumorgeneity. Tumorigenesis can either be enhanced or supressed by deletion of DNMT1. The effect of depleting the DNA methylation can be either early or late in tumorigenesis. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/IGF2 cluster on the paternal allele is routinely methylated. When methylated, CTCF does not bind to insulator elements, which allows enhancers to act on IGF2. This results in IGF2 expression. The enhancers cannot act on H19 when acting on IGF2 and therefore H19 is silent.</p>
<p>The H19/IGF2 cluster on the maternal allele is routinely unmethylated. This allows CTCF to bind to the insulator element and enhancers will act on H19. The enhancers will no longer be available to act on IGF2. H19 will be expressed but IGF2 will remain silent. </p>
<p>Cancer cells have a loss of imprinting. ICR's can either be hypermethylated or hypomethylated, losing their monoallelic parent of origin expression. When this occurs, genes are either expressed from both parent alleles or silent from both parent alleles. </p>
<p>IGF2 promotes cell growth. Excess expression of IGF2 can lead to overgrowth of cells. For example, in Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of the H19/IGF2 cluster occurs on both parental alleles leading to overexpression of IGF2. This occurs very early in tumor development and may have something to do with imprinted genes usually resulting in growth promotion or suppression.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMT is an enzyme that transfers a methyl group to DNA. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor and a nucleoside analog. This drug is used to treat patients with MDS that has progressed to AML. This drug irreversibly binds to DNMT's once they are incorporated into DNA and are replication dependent. The DNMT inhibitor prevents DNMT from transfering a methyl group to DNA thereby allowing gene expression, especially of tumor suppressor genes, to continue. Cells must be actively replicating for this drug to be effective. Because cancer cells tend to divide more rapidly than normal cells, this drug is more effective with targeting cancer cells. Decitabine should be used at lower doses for maximum demethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic marker, which is mitotically heritable. Epigenetic markers persist and are transferred to daughter cells. Hypermethylation of a specific locus will silence the gene in each daughter cell. Expression of the gene will persist in DNA hypomethylation. Altering methylation will lead to long term gene silencing or expression as the epigenetic marks persist. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is the period when epigenetic markers are removed and epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These sensitive periods include early development and during primordial germ cell development. At these times, all epigenetic markers are cleared.  Treating patients during sensitive periods would prevent certain epigenetic markers from clearing and also prevent necessary DNA methylation reprogramming from occuring. Improper epigenetic reprogramming could lead to a variety of other disorders.</p></div>
