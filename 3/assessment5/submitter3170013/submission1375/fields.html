    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Important regions of DNA methylation involved in cancer are CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. CpG islands, which are found in many promoters, are usually unmethylated in normal cells. In cancer, however, these CpG islands become hypermethylated, leading to gene silencing. These silenced genes are often involved in disease – for example, they could be tumor suppressor genes – and hence their silencing contributes to disease progression. In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells to maintain genomic integrity. In cancers, however, these regions tend to become hypomethylated, leading to genomic instabilitly such as chromosomal insertions and translocations. These chromosomal changes are mutagenic and cause disruption of genes, thereby contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, and hence disruption of imprinting can often lead to uncontrolled growth and cancer. An example of an imprinted region involved in cancer is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. In its unmethylated state, the ICR is bound by CTCF, a protein which insulates Igf2 from being bound by the downstream enhancers, which instead act on the H19 gene. Hence, on the maternal allele, Igf2 is usually less expressed. In its methylated state, as on the paternal allele however, there is no binding of CTCF to the ICR, and the enhancers can act on Igf2 to upregulate its expression. At the same time, H19 is silenced by the spreading of heterochromatin from the ICR. Disruption of imprinting at this H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to disease because Igf2 is an oncogene. If imprinting is disrupted, and the ICR on the maternal allele is methylated, the cell then has two alleles acting like the paternal allele, leading to significant growth promotion, and causing diseases such as Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and therefore can remove DNA-methylation on genes that would otherwise cause gene silencing. In cancers, the genes that are hypermethylated could be tumor-suppressor genes, which would cause overgrowth of cells and hence tumor formation. Decitabine can therefore have an anti-tumor effect by removing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and stopping the over-proliferation of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means they can be passed on to daughter cells, and therefore drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. However, patients should not be treated with such drugs during sensitive periods, which are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, when the environment could have effects on epigenetic make up. During development, these periods include the pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods, as well as the period of primordial germ cell development to mature egg or sperm. It would be inadvisable for patients to be treated with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these periods as important epigenetic marks are being laid down at these times, and if disrupted by the drugs, can potentially lead to developmental defects or disease in the patient’s children.</p></div>
