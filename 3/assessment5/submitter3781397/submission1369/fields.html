    <div class="field-value"><p>According to Dr. Marnie, in the simplest sense, cancer is caused by the activation of growth promoting genes and inactivation of genes that decrease proliferation. One of the ways epigenetic marks play a role in cancer is via DNA methylation. According to Knudson’s Hypothesis, cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. DNA methylation can be one of these hits that results in the expression of oncogenes and/or the silencing of tumour suppressors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In a normal cell, CpG islands are not methylated while the genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. The lack of DNA methylation at CpG islands in a normal cell allows the expression of tumour suppressor genes, thereby protecting cells from an unhealthy level of proliferation. The methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements keeps the DNA densely packed and protects the cell from genomic instability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In a cancerous cell, the CpG islands are heavily methylated while the genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated. Essentially, we see a swap in the methylation profiles between a normal and a cancerous cell. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Hypermethylating these CpG islands and CpG island shores results in the inactivation or silencing of tumour suppressor genes. When tumour suppressor genes are silenced, cancerous cells are given the unfettered ability to reproduce and form tumours. It is also believed that the hypermethylated state of CpG islands in cancer provides a competitive advantage for these cells. Hypomethylation of the repeats and intergenic regions results in genomic instability. This genomic instability may be displayed in illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and through the activation of cryptic promoters or disruption to neighboring genes. The effects of various genomic instability further contribute to disease.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In Dr. Marnie’s lecture on Hypermethylation of Sets of CpG Islands in Cancer, she discussed how alterations in DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions can result in either the loss of expression of growth restricting genes or the overexpression of growth promoting genes. This can occur via hyper or hypomethylation changes, and the outcome is dependent on the specific gene.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, Igf2 (a growth promoter) is silenced on the maternal allele because the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind. The CTCF insulates Igf2 from the enhancers resulting in H19 expression. On the paternal allele, the ICR region and H19 are silenced by methylation, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 which results in expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, a commonality is the loss of imprinting. In the case of Wilm’s Tumour, the loss of imprinting results in the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele. The ICR on both the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated and therefore silenced, resulting in a double dose of the growth promoting gene Igf2. This overexpression of Igf2 and silencing of H19 results in an overgrowth which leads to tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to the article, “Cancer’s Epicentre,” medications that work on epigenetics are already used to treat cancer. One FDA approved medication called Decitabine works by demethylating DNA, thereby reactivating expression of genes.  Decitabine belongs to the class of medications designed to inhibit DNMT (DNMTi). This medication is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that have progressed to AML. It works as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which is incorporated into the cell upon replication. After becoming incorporated, when the DNA methyltransferase comes to bind the DNMT, it is not available  to be copied to the daughter strand. In other words, the DNMT is bound irreversibly. The active nature of Decitabine is division dependent and therefore targets cancer cells more dramatically as they divide more rapidly. While all of the mechanisms of Decitabine are unknown, it has been shown effective in killing cancer cells, thereby resulting in an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation are significant because they can result in the expression or silencing of genes.</p>
<p>Dr. Baylin used a combination of a HDAi and a DNMTi. These drugs alter tumours in a way that makes the cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. One possible explanation for this lasting alteration is that epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. Changes made to cells are passed on during cell division to all daughter cells. This will continue to the granddaughter cells until the marks are actively erased.</p>
<p>These drugs should be used with caution because we do not understand their long term effects, specifically during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are times when an altered environment can have an effect on epigenetic control. These periods include early development and PGC development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the outcome is unknown. We know it is likely that the drugs work throughout the body and have the potential to impact every cell (not just cancer cells). The sensitive periods are critical, and we need to protect them from insults as they can result in serious modifications to epigenetics marks not only in the patient but also in future generations.</p></div>
