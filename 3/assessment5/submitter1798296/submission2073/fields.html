    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has several functions in normal cell epigenetics that would be adversely affected in cancerous cells with abnormal DNA methylation states.</p>
<ul><li>CpG islands</li>
</ul><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands, that are often located in gene promoter regions, normally results in gene expression silencing because it can a) bind transcription repressing proteins, b) bind proteins that would cause chromatin condensation and inactivation, or c) directly prohibit binding of transcription factors. Methylation of CpG islands can be cleared or established again during the lifecycle of a mammalian organism, and thus enables such processes as tissue differentiation and gene imprinting.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are very often hypermethylated, and as a result the corresponding genes are silenced. Since a number of genes are known to have anti-tumor regulation activity (e.g. via DNA repair, genome stability maintenance, or initiation of apoptosis in cases of irreparable damage), it is hypothesized that silencing of such tumor suppressor genes via CpG island hypermethylation may be one of the factors causing cells to become cancerous. In addition, hypermethylation may result in loss of gene imprinting, </p>
<ul><li>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</li>
</ul><p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements primarily serves a function of increasing genome stability. Unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements could act as unwanted promoters, transcription sites or splice sites, or lead to various genome mutations (deletions, insertions, transpositions, translocations). All of these are prevented by CpG methylation or subsequent mutation of methylcytosine into thymine. These regions are normally methylated in healthy cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, the whole genome, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, is often hypomethylated. This leads to general genomic instability of affected cells, which, if not prevented by anti-tumor factors, can result in rapid mutations and may produce proliferating tumor cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is a human hormone secreted mostly by liver and necessary for normal fetal growth. The IGF2 gene is located on the 11 chromosome, upstream of several regions regulating its expression:</p>
<p>- a binding site for the CTCF protein</p>
<p>- the H19 gene for a long non-coding RNA</p>
<p>- enhancers that activate Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>As a form of gene imprinting, in most cells expressing IGF2 the maternally inherited allele has no methylation of the CTCF binding region and the H19 gene. CTCF is able to bind and blocks IGF2 promoter activity. Thus, the maternal allele expresses H19 and doesn't express IGF2. The situation is opposite for the paternal allele - its H19 gene is methylated, CTCF doesn't bind, H19 isn't expressed, bug IGF2 is. It's interesting that both alleles have H19 methylation in some healthy tissues, including brain.</p>
<p>Nephroblastoma, aka Wilms tumor (note spelling - named after Max Wilms who first described it) was associated in research literature (e.g. http://www.pnas.org/content/92/6/2159.full.pdf)with relaxation of IGF2 imprinting (i.e. methylation of the maternal allele) and resulting Igf2 overexpression. As a growth factor, overexpressed Igf2 can cause tumorigenesis in affected liver tissues. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to a class of drugs known as nucleoside analogs. In normal cell lifecycle, nucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, 5-methyluridine, cytidine and uridine) are phosphorylated to corresponding nucleotides and used as building blocks for new DNA and RNA molecules. If present in a nucleus, nucleoside analogs can be used instead of corresponding nucleosides, become part of synthesized DNA or RNA, and produce effects dependent on their structure and chemistry.</p>
<p>Decitabine, due to it's structure, produces a nucleotide that is only compatible with DNA polymerase and thus can only become part of replicated DNA molecules in dividing cells. There it it inhibits the action of DNA methyltransferase and through subsequent cell divisions results in hypomethylation of the genome.</p>
<p>Decitabine is effective in suppression of some cancers, e.g. pre-leukemia, possibly through reactivation of tumor-suppressing genes, although exact mechanism of its action is not known</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As described in previous answers, proper DNA methylation is critically important to organism health. Any alteration of DNA methylation state can have detrimental effects. Cell machinery usually maintains DNA methylation through cell division (mitosis), so any changes in epigenetic state would be normally present in any descendants of affected cells, and thus have a lasting effect on the organism.</p>
<p>DNA methylation changes over the lifetime. This results in a number of sensitive periods with regard to DNA methylation.</p>
<ul><li>At conception, most of the DNA in egg and sperm cells is methylated. During early embryonic development, methylation of most CpG islands is erased to produce pluripotent embryonic cells. But some methylation is preserved as part of gene imprinting mechanisms. Any outside factors affecting DNA methylation at this stage could produce a non-viable fetus.</li>
<li>As the organism grows toward adulthood, tissue differentiation reestablishes much of the erased DNA methylation, which is further maintained in healthy somatic cells. Negative factors due to epigenetic drugs at this state could include growth defects or shortened life expectancy.</li>
<li>In germ line cell development, a second DNA methylation reset cycle takes place to reestablish appropriate methylation. Interfering with this process would not impact the organism directly, but could have detrimental effects on its possible progeny.</li>
