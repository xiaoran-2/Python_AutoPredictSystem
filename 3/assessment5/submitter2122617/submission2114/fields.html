    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands at the promoter of a gene is associated with silencing of that gene. </p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypermethylation at the CPG islands.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the CpG Islands silences tumor or growth suppressor genes allowing cancer cells to multiply.</p>
<p>Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genomic stability by inactivating/silencing these regions, which constitute a large part of the genome, thus decreasing risk of genetic mistakes occuring within them. </p>
<p>In cancer, there is hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation, with respect to repetitive elements,  increases the risk of genetic mistakes because the chromatin is more open and this activation can lead to translocations, deletions and insertions where there are repetitive elements (since similar elements are subject to recombination). Genome wide hypomethylation and genetic instability can lead to cancer.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can activate oncongenes, causing cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele – ICR is methylated –  silencing CTCF, which allows  IGf2 enhancer to act on Igf2.  Thus Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>Maternal allele – ICR is unmethylated – so CTCF is expressed, CTCF then binds with Ifg2 enhancer, so Igf2 enhancer does not act on Igf2  and thus prevents expression of IGF2.  </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated, causing expression of Igf2 on both maternal and paternal alleles, which doubles the dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, abnormally high growth causes this particular cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) Inhibitor..It is a hypomethylating agent –.  It inhibits DNA Methylation. In cancer, DNA methylation silences tumour suppressor genes. The cancers for which this drug is used are dependent on the de- activation of tumour suppressor genes through hypermethylation. This drug can reverse deactivation of suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic changes in methylation are mitotically heritable, changes in methylation carry forward to daughter cells, so new cells continue to express the induced change in the DNA.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when the epigenome is particularly vulnerable to alteration by environmental assaults because they are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming.  Two sensitive periods are the peri-implantation period and the period of primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treatment during sensitive periods may alter the expression of imprinted genes, causing disease. </p></div>
