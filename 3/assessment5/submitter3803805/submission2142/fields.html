    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, we find that there is hypomethylation of CpG islands and this allows more open chromatin structure, allowing transcription factors to bind and expression of genes to occur.</p>
<p>However, in cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated.</p>
<p>When this occurs in the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene (TSG), it results in the gene being silenced. In this way, the TSG can no longer do its normal function of controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. This is found frequently in tumor’s and it can either be the “2<sup>nd</sup> hit” leading to cancer or it can be one of the many mutations that accumulate in tumors. It is also mitotically heritable and progresses with time.</p>
<p>In contrast, we find that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>However, in cancer these regions become hypomethylated.</p>
<p>This leads to genetic instability as it can allow illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition of these elements, as well as activation of cryptic promoters, splice sites and disruption of neighbouring genes, all contributing to the build of mutations in tumors and genomic instability which is a hallmark of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele’s imprint control region (ICR) is usually methylated. This inhibits CTCF binding and therefore the enhancers are able to activate Igf2 and it is therefore expressed. H19 is also methylated on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>However, on the maternal allele, the ICR is usually unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind. This in turn prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2 and Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. The enhancers instead act on H19 and it is therefore expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the imprinting of the maternal allele is lost and the ICR is hypermethylated.</p>
<p>This contributes to disease because Igf2 is then expressed from both alleles, resulting in a double dose of the gene expression which is growth promoting and facilitates proliferation and tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).</p>
<p>It results in de-methylation or hypomethylation of DNA which was previously methylated.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action is that it is a nucleoside analogue, which means that it is incorporated into DNA with replication. Once it is incorporated and DNMT binds it in order to methylate the daughter strand, DNMT is bound irreversibly and it is unable to methylate DNA further. It is therefore replication dependent and cancer cells, which are replicating at a much more rapid rate, are much more severely affected than normal cells. It could allow the demethylation of TSG’s, which are hypermethylated in cancer, resulting in greater cell cycle control or DNA repair which is anti-tumorigenic.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark and it is mitotically stable and heritable, therefore it can be passed on to subsequent cell generations. Therefore altered DNA methylation can result in “permanent” changes to the epigenome unless passively or actively removed.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming occurs, or when an alternative environment can have an effect on epigenetic control as it is an a time when epigenetic marks are being established.</p>
<p>The most important sensitive periods are during pre-implantation period (early development) and during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>If treatment occurs during sensitive periods, there is the risk of permanently altering the epigenome as epigenetic marks are heritable and this could result in aberrant phenotypes and disease. It could also lead to transgenerational effects, if for example exposure to the drug is during pregnancy when the foetus is undergoing development and forming their germ cells for the subsequent generation.  </p></div>
