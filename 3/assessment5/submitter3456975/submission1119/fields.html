    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>The CpG islands have a high CpG density and thats the reason they are free of methylation independent of their activity state but in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and that causes silencing of the underlying gene and when the hypermethylation occurs in tumor suppressor genes, specifically promotes tumor process.</strong><br /><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to mantain genomic integrity or genomic stability, this is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. In cancer cells there are high poormethylation of these repetative elements or the intergenic regions, so the illegitimate recombination can occur because of the poor densely packaged down into hetero-chromes.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). The action of these kind of dgus depends on cell division, you have to have the cell replicating. Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, decitabine comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. It has been used at much lower doses, at these doses, you have a very good anti-neoplastic effect and it seem to be because it's causing DNA methylation.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation induced by DNA methyltransferase inhibitors results from an irreversible bind, and when the strand is copied the methylations is also copied to daughter strand, enduring the effect.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods are recongnized by developmental biology as a phase in the life span during which an organism has heightened sensitivity to exogenous stimuli that are compulsory for the development of a particular skill. If the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this "critical period", it may be difficult, ultimately less successful, or even impossible, to develop some functions. This periods are linguistics, vision, imprinting, auditory processing, vestibular system, and memory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The treatment of a patient during one of these periods of development would be inadvisible because, at molecular level, the inhibition of a cell function that is normal could be altered, and therefore, the development of that function could be non-satisfactory.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>The imprint control region (ICR) it's methylated on the paternal allele, and then the enhancers can act on Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to insulate this and Igf2 can be expressed. In the case of the maternal allele, the ICR it's unmethylated and CTCF binds to insulator element, and it means that the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silenced, so we don't see expression.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When loss of imprinting occurs you have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well as on the patenal allele and that causes expression of Igf2 also on maternal allele and now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell and Igf2 is promoting growth; this is the effect associated with Wilm's tumor</strong></p>
<p><strong>This disruption occurs as a very early event, so it's often seen in preneoplastic tissues and before you would actually decide that it really was a frank tumor. This suggests that maybe these hypermethylation, or hypomethylation events at the ICR might be very early events in tumorigenesis.</strong></p></div>
