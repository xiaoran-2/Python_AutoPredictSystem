    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to turn off expression of genes, and typically in the normal cells, most CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer, there is locus-specific hypermethylation where CpG islands are hypermethylated at tumor suppressor gene promoters, which will induce silencing of tumor suppressors and subsequent cell overgrowth and cancer.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genetic integrity and stability. These regions are hypermethylated and silenced in normal cells to prevent chromosomal transposition, deletions, insertions, and cryptic transcription within the genes. In cancer cells, there is genome-wide hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which causes expression of these regions resulting in transposons and cryptic promoters within genes. This leads to genetic instability and genetic aberrations observed in cancer cells including transpositions, deletions, insertions, and activation of growth promoting genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster has methylated ICR (Imprint Control Region is paternally imprinted). The methylation of the ICR prevents CTCF from binding to it, then the enhancers located downstream are not insulated by CTCF and can act on Igf2 to enhance its expression, thus promoting growth. So Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele. </p>
<p>On the maternal allele of normal cells, the ICR is unmethylated which will allow CTCF to bind to the ICR and act as an insulator that prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2. So on the maternal allele, the enhancers can not activate Igf2, but rather act on H19 and activate its expression. The Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>in Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster and loss of imprinting, which means both maternal and paternal alleles have methylated ICR, thus we have Igf2 expressed from both alleles instead of being expressed only from the paternal allele. This over expression of a growth promoting gene (Igf2) induces cell overgrowth and kidney cancer in childhood. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitor). It is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA and binds irreversibly to DNMT and therefore inhibits DNMT. So the impact would be DNA demethylation. </p>
<p>Decitabine has anti-neoplastic effect when used at low dose but is toxic and ineffective at high dose, and that's because it exerts its demethylation effect only at low dose. </p>
<p>The mechanism of action as anti-tumor drug is still unclear but it is thought that it acts by demethylating tumor suppressor genes and so is most effective in cancers that are dependant on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation like hematological malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome that progress to AML). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because of the mitotically heritable characteristic of epigenetic changes, thus once the epigenome is modified in a cell by a drug, the daughter cells will inherit the changes caused by the drug in the mother cell. So the effect of the drug can last beyond the period of drug treatment. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenetic marks are erased and reset in the cells. There are 2 main sensitive periods during development: early preimplantation period, and during germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could alter the epigenetic reprogramming and have significant side effects on germ cell formation for example if we treat younger patients with drugs that alter the epigenome. </p></div>
