    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the majority of unmethylated CpGs that occur in the genome happens in small clusters known as CPG islands found near promoters of genes and are associated with their active transcription.  Whereas there are certain CpG islands which are normally methylated like in the case of imprinted genes and genes on the inactive X chromosome in females. In cancer, two distinct aberrant patterns have been well described: localized hypermethylation in normally unmethylated CpG islands, and global genomic hypomethylation.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands contribute to cancer disease by loss of gene imprinting, by silencing expression of tumor suppressing genes and some others that might be involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis or invasion.  The second abnormal aberrant pattern seen in cancer involves unmethylation of normally methylated intergenic regions. The normally function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is involved in genomic stability through repression of expression of transponsable elements preventing deleterious transposition events in the genome.  The majority of this DNA hypomethylation in the genome in cancer cells is localized in repetitive elements localized in satellite sequences which are normally methylated.  Hypomethylation in these regions contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression through expression of transponsons which were previously methylated leading to deleterious transposition events and chromosomal instability. This genomic hypomethylation leads to the activation of oncogenes that were silenced and might be involved in loss of gene imprinting which differently contribute to different tumor phenotypes throughout their development and progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells at the H19/IGF2 locus, methylation is seen in the paternal allele in the ICR (imprinting control region) which spreads to the H19 promoter region and thus prevents CTCF binding which allows the enhancer to access IGF2 which leads to its expression. This leads to a paternal IGF2 gene expression.  In the maternal allele at the same locus, the ICR remains unmethylated. This methylation pattern allows the CTCF and its cofactors to bind ICR, which allow enhancer blocking and downstream enhancers acces the H19 promoter leading to H19 expression. In Wilm’s tumour imprinted control region of the maternal allele is methylated leading to the same gene expression pattern as the paternal allele.  This leads to overexpression of the IGF2 gene and loss of H19 expression in Wilm’s tumour. Overexpresion of the IFG2 gene leads to increased expression of its product which is a growth hormone protein contributing to unrestricted growth of the cell. This aberrant gene imprinting leads to uncontrolled cell growth seen in Wilm’s tumour and disrupting this gene imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster could lead to other specific diseases like Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome in childhood.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to demethylating DNA inhibitors and is a DNA-demethylating agent which has antitumour effect to treat myelodsyplastic syndromes which are precursors of mylegenous leukemia. This demethylating agent acts by suppressing methylation of tumour suppressor genes that might be involved in controlling cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.  If these genes are methylated inappropriately could lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation contributing to tumour cells proliferation in cancer disease. This means Decitabine could prevent hypermethylation in certain promoters of tumour suppressor genes which is one mechanism by which Decitabine might have an anti-tumour effect.  This demethylating agent can have another anti-tumour effect by preventing loss of genomic imprinting where aberrant parental genomic expression occurrs as seen in many cancer tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The long lasting effect of the drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the epigenetic marks are inherited through cell division. This modifications in epigenetic marks consequently persist in individuals during treatment and after they are treated with this drugs.  Treating patients with this type of demethylating agents in sensitive periods such as early embryonic development and germ cell development where methylation reprogramming and genomic imprinting occurs could lead to loss of genomic imprinting and aberrant parental of origin gene expression leading to predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours and to diseases like Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome where abnormal fetal and postnatal growth is seen.  Treating young patients with this demethylation drugs could be inadmisable too because methylation marks in somatic cells are still occurring during development, so this could lead to aberrant genomic imprinting and abnormal parent of origin gene expression which in conjunction might lead to different types of disease depending on the abnormalities created in the normal DNA methylation pattern.</p></div>
