    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. It is symmetrical and able to be maintained through cell division by DNMT1. CpG islands are made from a cluster of CpGs, often at the gene promoters. Promoters are at the start of genes, where transcription machinery binds. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. Methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of gene expression. </p>
<p>Aberrations in epigenetic control seen in cancer include locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer cells helps to silence tumor suppressor genes. This is extremely effective because it is mitotically heritable and involves epimutations. The epimutations result in a more rapidly dividing, nearly invincible cell that has a distinct competitive advantage over the others. </p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation occurs, to some degree, in all tumor types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity (like CGI hypermethylation). Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability. Cancer prevents the intergenic regions from aligning properly and being densely packaged down into heterochromatin, resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats. Hypomethylation activates repeats and promotes transposition, in turn activating neighboring genes and disrupting coding regions. This can lead to transcriptional aberrations in surrounding regions. Cancer increases the amount of deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations, producing an abnormal karyotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the paternal allele is methylated. CTCF cannot bind to the methylated region, allowing the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, enhancing its expression. H19 is not active on the paternal allele because of heterochromatin spreading. The methylation found at the imprint control region spreads to the H19 promoter, therefore silencing its expression.</p>
<p>The control region of the maternal allele is unmethylated and is bound to CTCF for that reason. A long non-coding RNA called H19 is being produced only on the maternal allele, however it has nothing to do with the establishment of imprinting at this particular cluster. CTCF is an insulator protein; it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. As a result, the enhancers are free to act on H19, enhancing H19's expression on this maternal allele.</p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted when the maternal allele is behaving like the paternal allele. Cdkn1c is a tumor suppressor found only on the maternal allele, and Igf2 is an oncogene/growth promoter found only on the paternal allele. When the maternal allele behaves as the paternal, the oncogene is upregulated. Increased growth and loss of suppressor leads to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, the <span>precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. <span>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). As previously stated, DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation through cell division. If decitabine inhibits, or prevents, DNMT1 from doing its job, the methylation will not be passed on to daughter cells. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because methylation at CpG islands silences the tumor suppressors. If this drug is a demethylating agent and inhibits DNMT1, methylation at the CpG islands will be prevented. As a result, the tumor suppressors will not be silenced and can effectively prohibit unwanted growths.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>This article suggests that mutations in chromatin related enzymes such as DNMTs, histone modifiers or chromatin remodelers might induce stochastic changes in the epigenome causing global changes in chromatin. This can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because DNMT would be permanently mutated. DNMT is in charge of maintaining methylation through cell division, so a permanent mutation in this process would effect all cells in a lasting way. </span></p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is a<span> period of epigenetic reprogramming; the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. The sensitive periods of development include<span> germ cell development and early embryonic development. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could negatively affect the patient. Sensitive periods involve epigenetic reprogramming; treating patients with various drugs could result in a mutation or worse. </span></span></span></p></div>
