    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation does not normally present in CpG islands, as CpG islands are mostly hypomethylated to ensure the transcription of genes. CpG islands frequently located in the promoter region of the gene, so unmethylated state of CpG islands ease the binding of transcription factor, which in turn will transcribe the gene of interest. Meanwhile, in intergenic, repetitive elements, as well as intronic region of normal cells, they are usually heavily methylated to maintain the genomic stability. Repetitive elements also contain strong promoter, which need to be methylated to silent the expression of undesirable genes. This balance, however, is disrupted in cancer cells, whereby CpG islands become heavily methylated while intergenic and repetitive elements becomes hypomethylated.  The changes in DNA methylation status in cancer cells have contributed to the rise of disease, as previously expressed genes may not be actively transcribed as DNA methylation in CpG islands have disrupt the binding site for transcription factors, which is important for gene transcription. Conversely, previously inactive genes in intergenic regions and repetitive elements would be actively expressed in cancer cells. This may cause disadvantages to the individual as expression of genes in these regions may result in faulty gene products (e.g. transposons), illegitimate recombination, or expression of foreign genes due to strong promoter effect in repetitive elements (cryptic promoters).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster in paternal allele is hypermethylated (especially in Imprint Control Region (ICR) and H19 regions), thus render the binding of CTCF. Due to the CTCF inability to bind to the paternal ICR, enhancers could work to promote the expression of Igf2 in paternal allele. On the other hand, H19/Igf2 cluster in maternal allele is hypomethylated. Hypomethylated H19/Igf2 ICR recruits CTCF, which would later block the enhancers effect to Igf2. Instead, H19 expression were increased by CTCF in maternal allele. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, ICR of H19/Igf2 maternal allele is also hypermehtylated, similar to paternal allele. This cause the overexpression of Igf2 gene from both parental alleles, as CTCF were absent in both alleles. H19 expression was also lost due to the hypermethylation status in maternal allele.</p>
<p>Disruption of ICR in H19/Igf2 cluster due to hypermethylation of maternal allele, making maternal allele acts like paternal allele. This cause upregulation of Igf2 gene. Overexpression of Igf2 causes uncontrolled cell growth, as Igf2 is an oncogene, and would later cause Wilm's tumour in children</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of epigenetic drugs. It inhibits the primary function of DNMT, which will target hemi-methylated DNA strand, and methylate the newly synthesized daughter strand. Decitabine would inhibit this methylation machinery, and prevent subsequent methylation of DNA strand.</p>
<p>Decitabine works by irreversible binding of DNMT proteins, inhibiting DNA methylation process, and leading to passive DNA demethylation. Decitabine is nucleoside analogues that would be utilized as nucleotide bases during the DNA replication. As cancer cells are highly active and dividing cells, cancer cells would have more Decitabine incorporation into the cancer genome. With higher number of Decitabine in cancer cells, the number of DNMTs being irreversibly bound would increase, thus preventing methylation of cancer genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on epigenome because DNA methylation status are being inherited mitotically during the individual lifetime. The changes are being passed on to daughter, granddaughter, and subsequent cells, until it is being actively reset</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period whereby the epigenetic status is being cleared out or reprogrammed. There are two phases of sensitive periods during the development; (1) during the early embryonic development, leading to blastocysts, and (2) during the primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>Treating the patients which are undergoing these sensitive periods would not be advisable as they are going through clearing out and resetting their epigenetic machinery. It would cause disruption of epigenetic status re-establishment during these sensitive periods. Disruption during this epigenetic reprogramming may affect the growth and survival of the individual (as happening in Assisted Reproductive Technologies), as well as affecting the future generations livelihood (e.g. Overkalix and Dutch famine situation). These disruptions would have long lasting effect because epigenetic changes are being mitotically heritable until they are actively cleared.</p></div>
