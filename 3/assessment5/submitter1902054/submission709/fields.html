    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can be induced by hypermethylation or hypomethylation depending on the genes or other genetic elements involved.  In the DNA of mammals, 70 to 80 percent of the cytosines are</p>
<p>methylated.  On the other hand the CpG doublets  in CpG islands are unmethylated for the most part.  The bulk of the methylation occurs in intergenic regions, in introns, repeated elements,</p>
<p>and imprinted gene clusters.    The CpG islands are in promoters of genes and are unmethylated as a condition for activity.  If the CpG islands are methylated in a promoter, the gene has been</p>
<p>trned off and it is equivalent to a mutation in the DNA that might render a gene inactive.  The inactived gene could be a tumor supressor or other gene necessary to mantain a normal non-</p>
<p>cancerous function of a cell.  The heavy DNA methylation in intergenic regions prevents undesirable read-through of genes that might start or exacerbate cancerous growth of a cell.  The DNA</p>
<p>methylatiion of repeated elements serves to silence these elements.  For example, the Iab elements are methylatedl to prevent them from being actived to read-through or transpose.  Transposing</p>
<p>elements could jump into new sites in the genome causing mutation-like events that cause disruption in gene transcription.  They could also lead up to reciprocal translocations, deletions and</p>
<p>duplications.  The methylation of other repeated elements maintains them in a condensed and inactive state. It also prevents recombination between homologous repeated elements spread</p>
<p>around  the genome.  Such recombination would also lead to translocation, duplications and deletions of chromosomes.  These chromosomal unbalances can add to the disregulation of cells</p>
<p>and further the cancerous character of them.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal genome the Igf2 gene of the paternal cluster is transcribed to produce insulin-like growth factor-2.  The methylation of the paternal chromosome is on the Imprint Control Regopm</p>
<p>(ICR) and on the promother of the H19 gene.  There are enhancers that exert their effect across the silenced paternal H19 gene and the paternal ICR and induce the transcribtion of the Ifgr2 gene.</p>
<p>The maternals chromosome is unmethylated at the H19 gene and the maternal ICR is bound by a CTCF proteiin wich acts as an insulator so that the transcription of thH19 gene is stimulated and</p>
<p>the Igf2 gene is not transcribed.  In Wilm's tumor patients the transcription of the Igf2 gene is increased by there being a mutation in the maternal ICR region so tjhat the maternal Ifg2 is transcribed</p>
<p>as well as the paternal allele.  The same happens if there are two paternally marked chromosomes.  There is also a materal effect in that fathers can carry the genetic and epigenetic defects, but</p>
<p>only mothers with the aberrant chromosome can have a child with Wilm's kidney tumor or the accompanying Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers often have DNA methylated on the CpG islands of promoters which inhibits transcription of the genes in that condition.  Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltranferases.  Chemically</p>
<p>it is 5-aza-2'-deoxhcytidine.  It is phosphorated <em>in vivo</em> to the triphosphate and is incorporated into DNA.  DMT1 which normally transfers methyl groups to the unmethylated cytosine of hemi-</p>
<p>methylated CpG locations.    If there is the 5-azacytosiine in the DNA the DMT1 is irreversibly bound to it.  The bound azacytosine is removed from the DNA and with the enzyme inhibited, methyl-</p>
<p>free cytosines are created and multiplied.  When both strands of the DNA in CpG regions are unmethylated they will tend to be mititically inherited in that way, at least in the short run.  The</p>
<p>demethylated genes will cause cells to be more normal and loose their cancerous properties.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An effective "epigenetic drug" is one which changes epigenetic marks on DNA or nucleosomal histones to caise a cancer cell to be more normal and less cancerous.  Altering DNA methylation</p>
<p>is inherited mitotically and therefore the effect is lasting through cell generations.  Standard chemotherapy with chemical agents like alkylating agents are predicated on the fact that cancer</p>
<p>cells are rapidly dividing and more sensitive to being killed by the chemical than normal cells.  Otherwise the chemical would have no benefical effect.  If the epigenetic modifying drug can</p>
<p>cause some part of the population of cells in a cancer to be normal, then these cells should be resistant to being killed by an alkylating agent.  The standard treatment would them kill the</p>
<p>unchanged cancer cells.  Sensitive period in an epigenetic context is a time when epigenetic marks cam be disrupted to the detriment of the cell or organism.  Formation of primordial</p>
<p>germ cells and pre-implantation embryonic development are sensitive periods.  The period between fertilization of the eggs and implantation and at the time of  primordial germ cell developement</p>
<p>shouldl be very sensitive.   Both of these periods occur <em>in utero</em> which might be a bad time to treat.  <strong>OUT-OF-SPACE</strong> </p></div>
