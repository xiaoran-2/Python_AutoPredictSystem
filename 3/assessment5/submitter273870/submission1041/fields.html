    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation represents the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, more precisely to the fifth carbon of cytosine. In mammals this process takes place mostly at the CpG dinucleotides. These CpG dinucleotides are often accumulated at regions called CpG islands, which tend to be at the promoters of genes. Gene promoters are usually protected from methylation by enzymes, however, if these CpG islands get somehow methylated, we can observe in most cases silencing of gene expression.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Throughout the genome, methylation tends to occur at intergenic regions (IGRs), repetitive elements, and even in introns. However, in cancer cells, the regions mentioned before become less methylated (hypomethylated), than in normal cells. Genome-wide Hypomethylation is a common epigenetic abnormality found in almost all tumours</span><span>.</span><span> It happens especially at repetitive elements, enabling them to jump from one location of the genome to another, increasing the risk of reciprocal translocation between chromosomes, disrupting neighboring genes, and endangering genomic stability. In contrast to repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns, CpG islands in cancer become hypermethylated (methylation to a high degree), thus increasing the risk of silencing the promoters of tumour suppressor genes (anti-oncogenes). Hypermethylation is also a common epigenetic abnormality, which is found in almost all tumour types. The number of hypermethylated CpG islands (CGIs), increases with aging. It is estimated that approximately 1 in every 3 individuals will suffer from cancer during their lifetime, making it a serious issue.   </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These genome-wide disruptions of epigenetic marks can be fatal for cells, leading to uncontrolled cell division, increased mutation rates, and genomic instability. But unlike mutations, these epimutations can be reversed, enabling us to help patients and treat them therapeutically.  <br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>THe H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, is located at chromosome 11 and is controlled by enhancer blocking. Since the imprinted control region of this cluster is methylated on the paternal allele, but unmethylated on the maternal allele, we can conclude that it is paternally imprinted (imprinted on the paternal chromosome). In this cluster, a long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) called H19, is produced at the maternal allele. Its role is in accumulating a specific micro RNA (mRNA). </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the imprinted control region at the maternal allele is unmethylated, an insulator protein (CTCF) binds to it. This proteins insulates Igf2 from the enhancers, thus allowing the now free enhancers to act on H19, improving its expression (all this happens at the maternal allele). On the other hand, on the paternal allele, when the imprint control region is methylated and H19 silenced because of heterochromatin spreading, Igf2 is no longer insulated from the enhancers, thus allowing the enhancers to act on it and promote Igf2 expression.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>However, if an individual suffers from an disorder (Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome), where he/she has two paternal alleles, but no maternal alleles, expression of Igf2 increases, thus promoting growth (Igf2 is an oncogene). These individuals have an increased risk of childhood tumours ( e.g. Wilm’s kidney tumour).</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine (sold as Dacogen) is an active ingredient which acts as an DNA methylation inhibitor. It is used for treating myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a hematological medical condition, that can lead to acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a potential candidate in fighting cancer on an epigenetic level. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, thus DNA becomes less methylated. This hypomethylation helps DNA become more accessible and transcription occur easier. As a result, the risk of silencing important transcription factors, tumour suppressor genes etc. decreases. As we can see, Decitabine strikes the problem at its roots, preventing silencing of genes and transcription factors at the first place.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>We know that altering DNA methylation with drugs, can have effects on the epigenome even after drug treatment, but why? First let’s look at cell division. Muscle cells, neurons, liver cells, all cells in our bodies have the same DNA, but differ by phenotype. This happens because of epigenetic marks. Different cells, express different genes. These epigenetic marks (in this case DNA methylation), are mitotically heritable, thats why muscle cells divide into other muscle cells, and not neurons. Same happens when using drug treatment that alter DNA methylation. The epigenetic marks will still be present even after cell division. The methyl groups will be passed on continuously, leaving long lasting effects in individuals. However, treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. Sensitive periods are phases of active remodeling of the epigenome. Epigenetic marks get removed, and new epigenetic marks laid down. We have sensitive periods during germ cell development and during early development. If we alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods, it would have a large effect on patients, leading to altered epigenomes, messed up gene expression, and alterations in the phenotype. </span></p></div>
