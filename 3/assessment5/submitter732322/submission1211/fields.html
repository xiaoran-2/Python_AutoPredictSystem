    <div class="field-value"><p>CG combinations are very unevenly distributed in the genome. Where they occur they have a high density. These dense regions -- 1000-2000 nucleotide pairs long -- are called CpG islands. They tend to remain unmethylated and they often surround promoters (about 60% of the promoters). A methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of the corresponding gene (by inactivation of the corresponding promoter). The methylation is laid down by de novo methyltranferase (DNMT3a) and maintained during cell division (by DNMT1).</p>
<p>Although Cancer is associated with a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation, CpG islands and CpG island shores are hypermethylated in Cancer cells. These hypermethylated areas cause silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Which CpG islands are hypermethylated differs by tumour type und subtype - and therefore can be used for diagnoses, choice of treatment, and prognosis.</p>
<p>Genes controlled by CpG island surrounded promoters are often so-called housekeeping genes -- they are essential for cell viability, growth control, and therefore they are active in most of the cells. Silencing of those genes can result in uncontrolled growth and malfunctioning cell death and consequently promotes tumour genesis. Tumour suppressors hypermethylation is more often than mutations.</p>
<p>On the contrary intergenic regions (IGR) and repeats are usually methylated but tend to be unmethylated in cancer. This leads to genomic instability (eg. illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions, aberrant activation of promoters and disruption to neighboring genes). Large hypomethylated regions can cover more than one half of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A small amount of genes (~150) depend on wether they are inherited from the mother or the father. While the paternal gene is active, the maternal gene is silence, and vice versa. This phenomenon is called genomic imprinting. An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. The Igf2 gene is a groth factor which is required for prenatal growth. Only the paternal gene is expressed. The methylation of an insulator element (ICR) on the paternal chromosome blocks its function, and allows a distant enhancer to activate transcription of the Igf2 gene (via its promoter, H19). The maternal chromosome is unmethylated at the insulator: it binds CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers: the gene is silenced. <br /><br />Wilm's tumour tends to correspond with activation of the maternal IGF2, a candidate dominant oncogene due to changes in Igf2 methylation. Because of the methylation of H19, IGF2 is expressed from both chromosomes which can lead to uncontrolled cell division (Igf2 is a growth factor) and therefore promotes tumour genesis.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). They bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA (replication dependend) and work therefore against hypermethylation of tumour suppressors in the next generation of cells. After preventing aberrant methylation (but also of normal methylation) of suppressor genes during cell division (inhibits methylation of the daughter strand), these genes can be activated normally and work in the usual way. So they are most useful in diseases that are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation, like precursors of AML, but they are also tested for the use in solid tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During germ cell development and early embryonic development epigenetic marks are cleared and the epigenome is reprogrammed. It is a sensitve periode. So the avoidance of interfering with these processes is more than advisable. Changes, for example in the epigenome during germ cell line, can cause serious damages for the next generations. <br /><br />There is also a short-term sensitive period: during cell devision. This is a chance for drugs like DNA-demethylating agents, but also a reason to be careful with these drugs. The impact of methylation changing agents is not restricted to the tumour, it can effect all genes in all cell, tumour cells are just more effected because of higher rates of cell division. Once changed, the epigenetic footprint is maintained during cell division, its alteration may have incalculable consequences since epigenic marks regulate gene expression and therefore determine different cell types.</p></div>
