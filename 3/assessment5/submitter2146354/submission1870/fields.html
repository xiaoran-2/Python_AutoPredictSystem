    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated. Methylation of a CpG island found at a promoter for a particular gene leads to silencing of that gene. In cancer, there is locus-specific hypermethylation, leading to methylation of many CpG islands which would be unmethylated in a normal cell. Methylation in the CpG island of a tumour suppressor gene will silence the gene and allow tumours to spread. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the cancerous cell can rapidly replicate and spread.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements of normal cells are usually methylated. DNA methylation in these regions is essential for genomic stability and the production of heterochromatin. In cancer, there is genome-wide hypomethylation and so intergenic regions and repetitive elements are less methylated than in normal cells. This causes genomic instability and loss of heterochromatin, leading to illegitimate recombination, transpositions, deletions and additions which can affect the normal functioning of genes. Other areas of the genome such as CpG poor promoters can become hypomethylated in cancer which allows genes such as oncogenes and tumour suppresors to become active. Specific tumour types have their own unique profiles of DNA methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed monoallelically dependent on parent of origin, i.e. a gene is only expressed from either the maternal or parternal allele. Disrupted imprinting can lead to a gene being expressed twice as much as it should be. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, disrupted imprinting can lead to Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>Normally, on the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. Enhancers act on the Igf2 gene and Igf2 is expressed. On the materal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and is bound by CTCF which insulates Igf2 from enhancers. The enhancers will act to express the H19 gene instead of Igf2, and there is no Igf2 expression from the maternal allele.  However, in Wilm’s tumour, the ICR of both the maternal and paternal alleles is methylated. This leads to Igf2 being expressed from both alleles and so is overproduced. As the Igf2 protein is growth promoting, this leads to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome/AML, and is a DNA methyltransferase inhibtor (DNMTi). It reduces the effects of DNA methyltranferases (DNMTs).</p>
<p>As DNA replicates, the DNMTi integrates itself into the DNA. It then binds permanently to a DNMT as it reaches the DNA to lay down new methyl marks on the new daughter strands of the DNA, which renders the DNA methyltransferase inactive and so DNA methylation is reduced. Due the fact that the DNA must be replicating for the inhibitor to integrate itself within the DNA, Decitabine is only effective during cell division. However, cancerous cells have high division rates and this allows Decitabine to be effective.</p>
<p>At particular low doses, DNMTi such as Decitabine are effective in killing tumour cells in this case as they cause DNA demethylation, which acts to reverse the effects of the aberrant DNA methylation which causes this type of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark – a hallmark of epigenetic marks is that they are mitotically heritable and the methylation patterns will be passed down to daughter cells. To alter DNA methylation it may be necessary to alter the epigenetic mechanisms e.g. by use of DNMTi in cancer therapy. Although these drugs are used to target cancer cells, they may also have an effect on other cells in the body as it is likely that other somatic cells will also be dividing during treatment, leaving them open to DNMTi integration. This could result in altered DNA methylation in normal body cells which could then be passed on to the daughter cells when division occurs.</p>
<p>A sensitive period, in terms of epigenetics, is one in which the cells are particularly sensitive to epigenetic changes. The cell’s environment can affect epigenetic reprogramming at these times. Primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation development are two major sensitive periods when cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming. Patients should not receive treatment during these sensitive periods as these drugs are major disturbances to the cell environment and could have serious consequences for epigenetic reprogramming and could therefore affect vital processes such as cell differentiation.</p></div>
