    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG-islands are usually hypomethylated (not methylated). However, the genome is methylated in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and in the introns of genes. At a global level normal tissue is methylated with 5mc. This methylation decreases as normal tissue progresses to the hyperplasia, neoplasia and invasion phase. In the invasion phase the abnormal cells (cancer cells) gets ready to invade other cells in the body. At the same time methylation of CpG-islands increases. CpG-islands are more likely to be hypermethylated (methylated) while the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns of genes are hypomethylated. Cancer cells therefore displays the opposite characteristics, with regards to methylation, compared to normal cells.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of GpG-islands in cancer leads to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. These genes would normally lead to the suppression of tumour growth if they were unmethylated. DNA methylation in mitotically heritable. The cancer with hypermythaltion at CpG-islands can therefore multiply. In this way the methylation and silencing of tumour suppressor genes is epigenetically carried over. Hypermethylation of specific CpG-islands varies depending on cancer type. Different CpG-islands are therefore hypermethylated in different cancer types. Single genes which are hypermythelated in CpG-island in cancer have been identified e.g. RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer and BRCA1 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) also occurs in cancer. This is where CpG-island hypermethylation of sets of genes is associated with certain types of cancer. When CpG-islands are hypermethylated there is usually also hypermethylation around the GpG-islands which is called CpG-island shores. If the promoter (located in the shores) are methylated the gene (e.g. tumour suppressor) is not expressed. This also insures the spread and maintenance of cancer. Identification of CIMP and specific genes is useful in determining the diagnosis, prognosis and success rate of treatment for certain cancer types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, genes that normally show monoallelic expression are disrupted. They become expressed or silenced on both parental alleles. Imprinted genes (associated with growth and cancer) can be growth promoting or suppressing and Imprint Control Regions (ICR’s) can therefore be hypomethylated or hypermethylated depending on the specific gene and its function.</p>
<p>            Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. In normal cells the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF (an insulator element) to bind to the ICR. The enhancers at the end of the maternal allele cannot act on Igf2 (in front of the ICR), because it cannot pass CTCF and instead act on H19. Due to this process H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silenced. In the paternal allele the ICR is not methylated (CTCF cannot bind to it) and enhancers act on Igf2 and it is expressed while H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>            In Wilm’s tumour there is a loss of imprinting on the maternal allele. ICR of the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated and H19 is inactive on both alleles while Igf2 is active on both, leading to a double dose of Igf2. This leads to tumour development, because Igf2 is a growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer leads to histone modifications by methylating histones more than they normally should be which also leads to the silencing of genes surrounding them (tumour suppressor genes). Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent and belongs to the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) class of epigenetic inhibitors. DNMT is incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT binds to the nucleotide, during cell division, they copy their methylation to the daughter cells. In this way DNMT is bound irreversibly. Decitabine leads to the demethylation of histones which in turn leads to the activation of tumour suppressor genes and the deactivation of growth enhancing genes. When tumour suppressor genes are activated and growth enhancing oncogenes are deactivated there will be less multiplication of cancer cells leading to an anti-tumour effect. Additionally, there has to be cell division for DNMT inhibitors to be successful. Cancer cells divides rapidly and are therefore more severely affected by DNMT inhibitors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Histone-deacetylase inhibitors used in Dr. Stephen Baylin’s study target histone deacetylasers. They affect transcription factors important in expression. They do not work specifically on cancer cells and we do not know what their effect is on normal cells.</p>
<p>Epigenetic factors influence genetic factors and vice versa. Using epigenetic drugs can cause changes in genes e.g. CGI hypermethylation, hypomethylation, altered histone marks , IncRNAs and nuclear structure can lead to point mutation, translocation, amplification, deletion, copy number variations and general genomic instability.</p>
<p>Every cell in the body is affected by epigenetic drugs. Early life (i.e. childhood) is considered a sensitive period regarding epigenetics. During this period there is an increased sensitivity to the effects of epigenetic mechanisms, because of germ cell development. Some cells are not in the maintenance phase yet. Treating children with epigenetic drugs is therefore inadvisable as it may lead to long-term adverse effects due to epigenetic irregularities. </p>
