    <h1>Submission 253 from Anon (session_user_id: a95acc9bbdc620d32b8e4ea536702405c62d88a5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors, a enzyme involved in DNA methylation. Drugs as Decitabine are nucleoside analogues, in other words, they can be incorporated into the DNA. During the process of replication, when the DNMT binds to the DNA to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it is bond irreversibly, impeding methylation from being tranfered to the daughter cells. Drugs like Decitabine works well on cancer cells because they are replicant dependent, and, as these cells replicate more rapidly, they are more affected. Some cancers are caused by epigenetics alterations, like hypermethylation on promoters of tumour supressors and DNMT inhibitors are very useful because they act impeding altered DNA methylation to be passed down.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally found at promoters of genes. The methylation in these regions aren't usual because they tend to be protected from methylation. What happens, though, in cancer cells, is the hypermethylation of CpG islands, silencing a gene that was otherwise active. The main problem is that this hypermethylation affects tumour supressor genes (<span>controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair), silencing their promoters and modifying the cell cycle. </span></p>
<p><span>To maintain genomic integrity, intergenic regions are normally methylated, avoiding abnormalities on the genome, deletions, translocations and duplications, for example. Methylation in repetitive elements are also important to maintain genomic integrity, preventing principally transposition and illegitimate recombination because the cromatin is densely packed (heterocromatin) impeding the proteins important to replication to access these regions. However, in cancer cells this regions tend to be hypomethylated, in other words, less or none methylation than was before, unlike what happens in CpG islands. So, all these epigenetic modifications induce genomic instability, a feature of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the ICR of the paternal allele is normally methylated, in other words, it is paternally imprinted. This ICR methylation blocks binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, allowing enhancers access to activate Igf2 expression. On the maternal allele, the contrary happens: ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF can insulate Igf2 from enhancers' action, repressing its activation. Then, enhancers act on H19 expression, instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by a imprinted disorder on the maternal allele, making it acts like the paternal allele, resulting in an increased expression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene. This loss of imprinting can be caused by a deletion/mutation or uniparental dissomy (UPD), two copies of one parental chromossome, in this case parental. By increasing the expression of a growth promoting gene, increase the predisposition to desenvolve tumours, in this case Wilm's tumour during embryonic and childhood periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inherited and this is important to maintain tissue homogeneity. This heritability is possible because during the process of replication, the paternal strain maintains the methylated cytosine, which is recognized by DNMT that methylates the daughter strand, keeping the DNA methylation marks. A sensitive period is characterized by active remodelling of the epigenome, this means that it is sensitive to environmental changes. During the embrionic development, there are two periods that are more sensitive: pre-implantation (fertilised egg to epiblast) and primordial germ cells to gametes production. Despite the embrionic period there is the somatic maintenance, less sensitive, but can suffer epigenetic changes as well. </p>
<p>Cancer treatments that are used DNMT inhibit drugs, like Decitabine, are not indicated to patients in sensitive periods. One group of people, that are not advisable to use these drugs, are children, specially because their organs and immunological system aren't well formed yet, altering others organs without cancer cells.</p></div>
