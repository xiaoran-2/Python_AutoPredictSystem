    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is required to maintain inactivated some genes. In a normal cell is very rare the presence of methylated CpG islands. However, in a cancer cell this mechanism is altered. In this case, CpG islands are hypermethylated at promoters of tumor supressor genes. Those kind of genes are important to control the cell cycle and proliferation. As the cancer cell interest is proliferate without any control, the hypermethylation of CpG islands at the promoters of tumor supressor genes is a good mechanism to cancer cells because they can proliferate without control and form a tumor and possibily invade the adjacent tissues.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation in a normal cell also occurs in intergenic regions and repetititive elements  to maintain the genomic estability. In a cancer cell, it doesn't occur. In this case, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated which contribute to genomic instability. This instability allows the illegitimate recombination between repeats which can activate repeats and cause transposition,  activate cryptic promoters, cause disruption of neighbouring genes, deletions, reciprocal translocation and insertions. All those alterations can promote the uncontrolled proliferation by inactivating tumor supressor genes and activating oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele consists in methylation of the H19 promoter which forbid the CTCF to bind. Thereby, the enhancers can promote the Igf2 expression normally because don't exist any barrier that can block them. In the maternal allele, the opposite happens: the promoter of H19 is unmethylated which allows the bind of CTCF and the expression of H19 gene. The CTCF protein block the action of the enhancers which can't promote the Igf2 expression. </p>
<p>When all those mechanisms are damaged the Wilm's tumor can occur. In this case, the both alleles are methylated. Thereby, the CTCF protein can't bind the H19's promoter which allow the enhancers to act and promote the Igf2 superexpression by the two alleles.  As Igf2 is a growth factor, its superexpression promotes the cell growth in a exceed way which contribute to cell uncontrolled proliferation and possibily the tumor formation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. These drug acts as a DNA-demethylation agent which allows these drug to activate genes because decitabine removes the methyl group. Its fuction is important to inhibit the silence of tumor supressor genes caused by its promoter hypermethylation. Thereby, the tumor supressor genes can be expressed normally and regulate the cell cycle and proliferation. This action prevents the development of a new tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mechanim that is mitotically heritable because of the action of DNMT1 enzyme. This enzyme acts in the DNA replication promoting the permanency of epigenetic marks during the organism life. Thereby, the altering DNA methylation in one cell can pass for the daughter cells.So, the this mechanism can enduring effects on the epigenome and the patient who is treated with epigenetic drug can be more susceptible to standard treatment for a long period. </p>
<p>During the individual development, there are some periods during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. There are two periods: after the fertilisation until the blastocyst formation and after the primordial germ cells formation until the gametes production. Thereby, it is advisable that pregnant patient don't use the epigenetic drugs during her pregnancy because they can affect the DNA methylation pattern of her's daughter gametes. </p>
