    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation regulates tissue specific and imprinted genes and maintains genome stability.  DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of genes around these islands.  Hence a normal gene open to transcription has an unmethylated CpG island.  In cancer, CpG islands, and their surrounding CpG island shores, can become hypermethylated resulting in a gene or genes close by being turned off. If this occurs in relation to a tumor suppressor gene this could become one of the steps of deregulation resulting in cancer.  A gene close to an unmethylated CpG island and consequently active, often has methylated intronic regions, intergenic regions and repetitive elements which serve to regulate how the gene is transcribed and maintained stabily.  In cancer there is often a correlation between CpG island hypermethylation with demethylation of these intronic and intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements.  Unmethylated repetitive regions can lead to accessibilty to other similar regions leading to abnormal recombination in mitosis resulting in unequal crossovers leading to deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions hence general genome instability.  Intronic methylation may be active in regulating splicing out of introns so loss of this may result in abnormal transcripts.  Likewise, with loss of methylation of intergenic regions, regular transcription of genes in this area may be disrupted.  The development of cancer usually requires more than one genetic or epigenetic disruption.   Alteration of DNA methylation has been shown to be a key component in the epigenetic association with cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, disruption of imprinting at the ICR downstream of Igf2, a growth promoting gene, can result in Wilm's tumour in children.  Normally the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and the 5' end H19.  Methylation of the ICR prevents binding of CTCF so the enhancers downstream of H19 feed back on Igf2 keeping Igf2 replication turned on.  The maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR or the 5' end of H19 so CTCF is able to bind to the ICR.  This blocks access to Igf2 by the enhancers so Igf2 is not actively transcribed but rather the enhancers act on H19.  In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated at the ICR and the 5' end of H19 resulting in the enhancers acting on the maternal Igf2 since CTCF is no longer blocking access to the enhancers so Igf2 is actively transcribed from both the paternal and maternal genes.  Igf2 is a growth promoting protein so overexpression contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is used to treat cancer as a DNA methylase inhibitor.  Decitabine is an analogue of cytidine so it can replace cytidine during DNA synthesis.  However, unlike cytidine, it can not be methylated and can bind DNMT1 irreversiblly so incorporation of Decitabine into CpG islands can lead to downstream genes being turned on.  When this occurs in CpG islands close to tumour suppressor genes, these genes will be turned on and consequently some cellular control will be returned so tumours may regress.  Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which can preceed acute myelogenous leukemia.  As well, used in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor, it has been shown to slow tumour growth in advanced lung cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns that are altered by drugs can be passed on through mitosis so can become independent of the presence of the drug.  Periods where imprinting is being laid down are sensitive times to be making changes in DNA methylation patterns.  Sensitive periods include during the formation of the primordial germ cells and early embryonic development.  It would not be advisable to treat patients with drugs that effect epigenetic changes during these periods since it is not presently known what the effect on future generations would be if DNA methylation or imprinting was impacted by these drugs.</p></div>
