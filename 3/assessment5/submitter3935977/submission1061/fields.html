    <div class="field-value"><p>To correctly discribe the abnormal DNA methylation in cancer, first of all, we will describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands; in a correct way, the demethylation of cytosines is asociated with the activation of the gen, in the other hand, the methylation carries inactivation.</p>
<p>In cancer, the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted. The mechanism is by the tumor suppressor hypermethylation. We can hightlight some examples, as RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MGMT in gliomas and colorectal tumours.</p>
<p>So, the explanation of how disruption of DNA methylation at CPG islands contributes to disease, is very easy. Nowadays, cancer is relationated with tumor supressor gens and oncogens. When is due tumor suppressor hypermethylation, the gen or the group of gens than can reduce the probability of formation of tumor cells, have a high grade of methylation, so they are inactive, in consequence the products of the tumor suppressor gens who inhibite the cell proliferation, are not syntethase, therefore the cell can proliferate easily.</p>
<p>The normal function of the DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, is to mantain genomic integrity. In case of genomic integrity, it is not very clear, but for example Dnmt1 null cells displais genomic inestability and we must stand out silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity by silecing of repeats; mutation of the repeats, to prevent transposition; silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and finally methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are altered, in this case, the aberrations are due by hypomethylation, genes that must be silence are active, the gene dosage increase which implies more probability to suffer from cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In case of <em>Igf2</em> the methylation pattern, the paternal allele is expressed; because the absence of CTCF (insulator protein) makes enhacers can access <em>Igf2</em>, resulting in activation.</p>
<p>In the other way, the maternal allele is not expressed; CTCF insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhacers, and this union is possible through this region is not methylated. So, enhacers can't bind it, and they bind to the <em>H19</em> promoter and promote high gene transcription. In conclusion, there is <em>H19</em> promoter transcripcion in the matternal allele and silence in the patternal allele.</p>
<p>Exists a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours (not in adults), as the Wilm's tumour, which afects the kidney. It can be endured in the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. In this imprinted disorder, the maternal allele can have methylated the <em>Cdkn1c</em>, which will must be expressed (lost of <em>Cdkn1c</em>) , and<em> Igf2</em> is repressed. But in the paternal allele can be unmethylated the Kcnq1 cluster, being expressed the <em>IGf2/H19</em> cluster (upregulation of <em>Igf2</em>).</p>
<p> In the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome the disrupting of the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can provoke disease, many imprented genes are involved in growth so any change can trigger in several healthy problems. The lost of tumor suppresors entails growth suprresing and the upregulation of oncogenes entails growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, the way it does is by inhibating the DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Describing the impact, it has a very similar mechanism with Azacitidine.</p>
<p>It is a chemical analogue of cytosine nucleoside, the DNA methyltransferase acts by recognizing O6- methyl guanines, and this bases can not bind with cytosines, so the protein methyl guanine methyltransferase recognize them, and it transfers the methyl group to an own cysteine. The consequence is a remarkable decreasing of the methylated genes.</p>
<p>These drug is used as anti-tumoral. In cancer CpG islands are methylated so Decitabine boost the hypomethylation of them. Methylated CpG islands can result in activation of genes, and exists the possibility of activation oncogenes. It is well known that oncogenes have potencial to produce cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are moments in the development of an organism, where methylation patterns are being made.  We can define a sensitive period as a period of epigenetic reprogramming, when occurs the phenomena of clearing and reseting of genomic marks.In mammals, are two, in blastocyst and in the formation of the gametes in the embryo. In the blastocyst, maternal and paternal genome suffers a process of demethylation, so when the new methylation patterns are made and the epiblast is achive, the somatic cells in the organism will have this pattern. In the other sensitive period, maternal, paternal methylation patterns and imprinted genes are reset, and these changes will cross to the offespring.</p>
<p>The treatment during sensitive periods is very complicated. First, because changes in the blastocyst period will carry permanent patterns of methylation in somatic cells, which can be not correct and will incite several health problems. Secondly, in the formatioin of the gametes in the embryo, this changes will affect the future offespring, something inadvisable.</p></div>
