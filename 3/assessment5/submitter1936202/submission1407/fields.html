<p>DNA methylation usually occurs on the cytosine of CpG islands. The CpG islands have an uneven distribution found more in promoters that are near to the start site of many genes, but remainder of the genome are CpG poor (including virus integration sites, intronic and intergenic regions). DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing and maintenance of genome stability(silencing of repeats prevent transposition and recombiantion etc in the intergenic and repetitive region) along with other mechanisms(It is dependent on the region of the DNA and its accessibility for DNMT). Not all CpG islands in the genome are methylated: It is resistant in normal cells and CpG poor regions are prone to methylation. The methylation patterns are established during embryonic development and are disrupted in cancer(Eg.the hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor gene as an attempt to silence it). The CpG island are susceptible to methyltransferase activity. CpG poor region undergo hypomethylation. E.g. 5-methylcytosine is decreased in cancer cells (genomic). Hypomethylation of bulk cellular DNA result in genomic and chromosomal instability(disruption of methyaltion in intergenic and repetitive region: from illegitimate recombination between repeats and activation of repeats and transposition)- implying a global switch mechanism that directs changes in chromatin structure accompanying changes in DNA methylation pattern-- the result is silencing of tumour suppresor gene and its associated downstream pathways.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprintng is the introduction of epigentic marks into gene that results in monoallelic gene expression (expression of 1 gene from the parent). In the H19 /Igf2 cluster, the H19 is maternally expressed and the Igf2 is paternally expressed in normal individuals. The cluster is found at 11p15.5 in humans. Proper imprinting  of this cluster would involve methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele and unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele. The methylation of the ICR (and methylation of the H19 promoter) at the paternal allele such that the CTCF is unable to bind to the ICR allowing downstream enhancers to activation of Igf2 (and expression of Igf2). THe unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele allow binding with the CTCF protecting the ICR and promoter of H19 from methylation and the prevention of the enhancers from activating Igf2 but instead activates and expressin of the H19. Loss of imprinting for the Igf2 causes the biallelic expression of Igf2, increasing the amountof Igf2 to stimulate the growth of tumour cells and prevents destruction of damaged cells. The disruption of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 is also linked to the kcnq1, reuslting in loss of Cdkn1c seen in Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. (DNA demethylating agent, hypomethylates DNA). </p>
<p>It is a chemical nucleoside analogue, which is incorporated into DNA during replication, binds and inhibits DNMT at low doses and causes non specific cell death at higher doses. </p>
<p>It can have an anti tumour effect in 2 ways. Firstly the demethylation of specific genes, leads to eg. expression of the once repressed gene(Eg. tumour suppressor gene) due to methylation, allowing control over cell death and division and inducing cell cycle arrest at S-phase. Secondly, cause of non specific cell death in highly replicating tumour cells (incorporates more of decitabine into DNA) due to higher doses of decitabine. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that methylates DNA can have enduring effects on the epigenome, as epigenetic marks are passed down to daughter cells through mitosis, the epigenetic changes induced or brought about by the drugs such as decibatine will be passed down to the daughter cells. Changing the possible epigenetic marks that the individual has.The sensitive periods of development will be the period to avoid the treatment of patients with these drugs..</p>
<p>A sensitive period is an important period of time in the development when the environment have control/ influence over the individual's epigenome and heritability.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are the Stage between pre-implanatation to post implantation period of the embryo and the the stage between the primordial germ cell development to the formation of gametes.</p>
<p>Treating the patient during these sensitive period will alter the epigenetic marks that are essential for development woll be passed down to daughter cells and may affect the offspring the patient may have.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-8c3348600eaf2ba8e6a5e625/970238/asst-5/970238-521250a1168143.85538738.txt">list of refences.txt</a></p></div>
