    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. On a normal cell, hypomethilation of CpG islands occurs, rather than hypermethilation. .On a normal states, methilation on CpG islands placed on the genes promotors induces silencing on that gene.</p>
<p>2. In cancer, there are mainly two abnormalities observed so far regarding to DNA methylation: one is <strong>HYPERMETHILATION</strong> of DNA which is locus specific and the second one, by contrast, it is not locus specific but rather it is spread throughtout the genome: <strong>HYPOMETHILATION of DNA. </strong></p>
<p>3<strong>.</strong>  Hypermethilation on CpG islands, acts as an alternative to mutation, silencing tumor supressor genes which is mitotically heritable. This enables the growing of the tumor; It produces cells that live longer and die less.</p>
<p>4. Hypermethilation on normal cells occurs on the repetitive element, the intergenic regions and the introns. The main function is to mantain the genome stability, conserve the number of cromosomes and avoid dangerous recombinations. The genome stability is possible due the hypermathilated state does not let the cromatine to be in an eucromatine state.</p>
<p>5. In cancer, The repeats due to hypomethylation, being able to create copies of themselves. These regions and their changing their position throughout the genome.</p>
<p>6. The disruptions come from inastibility of the genome which drives to abnormal karyotypes caused by: deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and it is an hypomethilating agent, which means that reduces the hypermethilation on the DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase. The anti-tumour effect of decitabine lies in reducing the methylation on specific sites as CpG islands on genes promotors. As we have seen already, hypermethylation enables the growing of the tumour by silencing the expression of the tumour-supressors genes. If that sites are in a normal state of methylation (normally, hypomethylated) normal expression of tumour-supressor genes can stop growing and methastasis of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern is really stable: stays throughout the development of the cell and pass from one generation to generation subsequently. If this alteration occurs during the sensitive periods (that can be defined as a period, normally early in cell life in which the sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms increase), where reprogramming of the methylation pattern take place, this pattern would change in order to generate an aberrant state of methylation that leads to disease, and this will last on the next generations. It is necessary to explain when these sensitive periods happen: mostly, during gametogenesis and after fertilization. Experimentally, artificial reprogramming of somatic cells is also possible to induce a pluripotent state.  Hence, treating the patient to change the state during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could disrupt a normal methylation pattern causing and aberrant one that may also leads to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele for the gene Igf2 makes possible that the expression is only from one allele, in this case from the father so the maternal allele is silenced (imprinting pattern). The different places where the methylation occurs are different from the mother allele comparing to the father allele: Upstream of the paternal allele the promotor is hypomethylated on the CpG islands, so active; an RNA is transcripted from this allele which codifies the IgF2 protein. On the other hand, the promotor that is unmethylated and blocked on the maternal allele. In both cases, the expression of the allele closely interacts with the expression of another gene: H19. H19 is not expressed from the paternal allele but it is indeed on the maternal allele: in Wilm´s tumour there is lack of expression of H19 and biallelic expresion of Igf2. The disruption on the imprinting regions makes possible that an abnormal transcription to take place in regions that should not be active or, by contrast transcriptional active. </p></div>
