    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the processes by which genomic stability is maintained.  Aberrant DNA methylation leads to disease; such is the case in cancer. Methylation levels at CpG islands and at inter-genic areas and repetitive elements are altered in cancer cells. CpG islands, where there is a concentration of CpG dinucleotides are found in around 60% of promoters. Methylation is normally associated with gene silencing at gene promoters. However, CpG islands are generally kept free of methylation whether or not the region is active or inactive. In cancer, CpG islands tend to have an access of DNA methylation which leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (such as BRCA1) which can allow the development of cancer cells. Methylation patterns can vary by tumor type. Recently, it was discovered that CpG island shores also display hyper-methylation in certain cancers. In contrast, repetitive elements which occur in multiple copies throughout the genome are highly methylated in normal cells.  In cancer cells, the repetitive elements are hypo-methylated which leads to genomic instability by permitting illegitimate recombination (insertions, deletions and/or translocations), activating cryptic promoters and disrupting genes in the vicinity.  Importantly, DNA methylation is dependent on the context.  Deliberately suppressing methylation can diminish tumor growth in cases where hyper-methylation of tumor suppressor genes occurs but can enhance tumor growth where genomic instability is caused by activation of repetitive elements. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An example of how the disruption of gene imprinting can contribute to cancer is the H19/lgf2 cluster which controls the expression of H19 (a growth suppressor) and lgf2 (a growth promoter).  In a process of chromatin looping, enhancers downstream of the genes prefer to loop to lgf2, but will loop to H19 if lgf2 is blocked.  In a normal cell, the maternal allele is un-methylated allowing the CTCF insulator to bind to lgf2 and thus preventing the downstream enhancers from acting on lgf2.  The enhancers instead act on H19 on the maternal allele limiting cell growth.  On the paternal allele, CTCF is methylated and therefore the enhancers are free to act on lgf2 encouraging cell growth.  In Wilm’s tumor, both the maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, causing lgf2, the growth promoter, to be enhanced on both alleles leading to abnormal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. DNA methyltransferases maintain DNA methylation by laying down methylation marks on to daughter cells after cell division.  DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine irreversibly bind DNMT’s and inhibit that process and thereby reduce methylation on future generations of cells. Decitabine has been effective in the treatment of haematological malignancies like myelodysplastic syndrome.  Since myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with hyper-methylation of CpG islands, it is likely Decitabine is effective because it reduces the methylation at these regions.  Decitabine acts on all dividing cells but because cancer cells rapidly divide, the impact on cancer cells is more pronounced than on normal cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drug treatment that targets epi-genetic machinery can have effects long past the duration of treatment. Epi-genetic marks are generally mitotically heritable so, for instance,  if a drug reduces DNA methylation in cancer cells, daughter cells will inherit the new level of methylation and pass it on to future generations.  There are periods of intense epigenetic re-programming that occur during early development, primordial germ cell development and germ cell/gamete maturation. During these periods, the organism is highly sensitive to disruptions in its environment. It would not be advisable, for example, to treat a young person who is experiencing germ cell development with a drug that has epi-genetic effects.  The drug treatment would be an environmental insult that may have lasting detrimental effects on the individual and on future generations. </p></div>
