    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is , as it sounds , the addition of a methyl group to the DNA. This happens at cytosines.</p>
<p>A cytosine single ring base, can add on a 5-methyl group so it is added on the 5-carbon on the fifth carbon. The methyl group is chc group is added directly onto the base.</p>
<p>In mammal´s DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at Cs and is followed by Gs. So cytosines are followed by guanines, and this is called a Cp G dinucleotide. The p refers to a phosphate bond between the two. The dinucleotide is symmetrical. The other strand of DNA allows them to be maintained through call division.</p>
<p>Therefor in a normal cell, there is hypomethyled in the Cp G island group.</p>
<p>In Cancer cell , the Cp G island is more likely to be methylated.</p>
<p>Therefore, this  tends to be called Cp G island Hypermethylation.  In general when you look at where the Cp G island is founded, it can be founded where the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>A Cancer cell is able to inactivated a tumor suppressor genes, it could do it genetically, or it could happen epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene and locking it in an acyl in an active state.</p>
<p>Therefore DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the intergenetic regions and repetitive element usually is methylated because its function maintains genomic integrity.</p>
<p>In a Cancer cell  the repetitive element and intergenic region are hypomethylated. In contrast the Cp G islands are more likely to be methylated.</p>
<p>This kind of swap happens epigenetically because of the silencing of the tumor suppressor gene by locking it in an acyl in an active state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated so the en enhancers act on igf2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate.  igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the CTCF is unmathylated on the maternal allele , therefore unmathylated CTCF4 binds an insulator element and this means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19, but igf2 will be silent fot the maternal allele , so it does not get expressed.  </p>
<p>What happened when the imprinting control region is hypermethylated in both the paternal and maternal alleles , and one cell has a double dose of igf2 and an over expression. Well this would be associated with willm´s tumor.</p>
<p>A loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types in H19, igf2. In fact it occurs as a very early event, it is often seen in preneoplastic tissues, this suggests that maybe this events at the imprinting regions hypermethylation  or hypomethylation events might be very early events in the tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methyltransferasa inhibitors drugs (DNMti), fight against DNA methyltransferas. Commercially Decitabine and Vidaza both FDA approved.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a drug that works against   methyltransferasa, it is an inhibitor. It is approved for myelodyspastic syndrome. This syndrome can progress to  acute leukemia or AML.</p>
<p>Both of these courses are hematopoietic blood malignancies. Vidaza and Decitadine and others in preclinical trial are all nucleosisde analogs, so they get incorporated in to the DNA upon replication,then when the DNA methyltransferasa comes along to bind, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand. That DNMT1 is bound irreversibly and it cannot longer be released. This means that the action of these DNA methyltransferasa inhibitors is division dependent. So it has to have cell replication. Therefore, the cancer cells which are divide more rapidly than most of the other cells  will be more severely affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period refers to the epigenetic reprogramming during germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are categorized as follows:</p>
<p>a)      Early development with gametes fertilized egg and blastocyst</p>
<p>b)      PGC development or primordial germ cell development</p>
<p>In the sensitive periods the germ cell needs to remove the particular epigenetic marks that made sperm or egg that have a particular sets of genes that need to express.</p>
<p>After implantation in the early embryonic development the epigenetic marks are re-stabilized  and associated  with the particular gene expression.</p></div>
