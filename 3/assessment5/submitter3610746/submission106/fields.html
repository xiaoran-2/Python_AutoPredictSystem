    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island leads to transcriptional silencing of the genes. Methylation leads to decreased binding of transcriptonal proteins, as well as by recruiting MECP2 binding, which leads to compact chromatin.</p>
<p>CpG islands in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes may get hypermethylated leading to decreased expression. This will abolish the suppression of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Expression of tumor suppressor genes leads to inhibition of oncogenes. CpG island in the promoter of such genes are normally unmethylated. In cancer, these CpG islands get hypermethylated leading to inhibition of their expression. Absence of the tumor suppression genes will lead to increased expression of oncogenes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions leads to genomic stability. It is also responsible for silencing of cryptic transcription start sites. DNA methylation in repetitive elements helps in maintaining genomic integrity. This is done by either silencing or mutation of repeats to prevent transposition.</p>
<p>Silencing of repeat elements by DNA methylation avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters. DNA methylation mediated silencing of repeat elements prevents unintended recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation is reduced at intergenic regions and repeat elements. Such hypomethylation at intergenic regions has been found in all cancers, and leads to genomic instability through unintended recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, as well as activation of cryptic sites leading to disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting silences gene expression in a parent-of-origin dependent allele specific manner. In normal cases, the <em>H19</em> expression is from maternal allele, and <em>Igf2</em> expression is from the paternal allele. In normal cases, <em>H19</em> is hypomethylated in females, while it is hypermethylated in males. In cancer, biallelic hypermethylation of <em>H19</em> can abolish expression of this lncRNA, thereby leading to activation of the maternal <em>Igf2</em> expression. Thus, <em>Igf2</em> expresses both from maternal and paternal alleles. Such increased<em> Igf2</em> has been found in many different types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating class of drugs. It is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. Increasing dose of Decitabine will reduce DNA methylation. Such demethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes will allow expression of tumor suppressor genes and abolish expression of oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation effects can pass on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Thus, drugs that alter DNA methylation will have lasting effects on the epigenome. Sensitive period is the time in development during which epigenome is vulnerable to methylating/demethylating agents. Treatment during such sensitive periods will have a lasting effect on the epigenome.</p></div>
