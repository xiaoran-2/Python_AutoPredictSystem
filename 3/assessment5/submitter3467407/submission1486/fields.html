    <div class="field-value"><p>In the nucleus of a normal cell, CpG islands, and at their shores and imprint control regions, are not heavily methylated at the tumour suppressor genes.  In contrast, cancer cells show hyper-methylation at CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. Examples include: the RB gene in retinoblastoma; MLH1 in colorectal cancer; BRCA1 in breast cancer; and, MGMT in gliomas, colorectal tumours; IFFO1 in ovarian cancer; GSTP1 in prostate cancer; and also miR-34b/c involved in cancer metastasis. Hyper-methylation of CpG islands is detectable in all known cancer types. The methylation of the CpG islands associated with suppressor genes prevents gene expression needed to keep cell growth normal. Further, this methylation is mitotically heritable and so will continue as cells divide. Under the Knudson Hypothesis, this disruption of tumour suppressor genes, in combination with other ‘hits’ such as activation of an oncogene, can cause cancer by limiting normal cell-death and allowing such cells to have competitive advantage over normal cells. Over time this methylation increases, allowing cancer to progress more readily.</p>
<p>Methylation is the opposite in inter-genic regions, gene introns, and particularly in repetitive elements: in normal cells these are often methylated, but cancer cells show much less methylation. Hypo-methylation is found in all known types of cancer and occurs early in cancer development. It reduces genomic stability, allowing improper recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, and activation of cryptic promoters which can disrupt neighbouring genes. Hypo-methylation of imprint control regions and of CpG-poor promoters can activate genes that contribute to instability such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. The hypo-methylation of these sections of DNA in cancer cells opens up the DNA for expression which would not occur in normal cells because they would be densely packaged within hetero-chromatin.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Baylin used epigenetic treatment to slow lung cancer. Some who did not respond to the trial itself later responded better than expected to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  However, while most methylation is re-set during meiosis, some survives resetting during a sensitive period in a parent, or grandparent’s life, such as during the development of a foetus or the development of the gametes in a foetus. This has been demonstrated in multiple experiments on rodents and by observation of humans.</p>
<p>The most sensitive periods for epigenetics in mammals, including humans, are those when the resetting of epigenetic marks normally occur, that is, in the days immediately before conception for both the father and the mother, and during early pregnancy for the mother from fertilisation through implantation of the epiblast.  Another sensitive period is while primordial germ cells are formed in the foetus.</p>
<p>The drug treatment described in <em>The Economist</em> article makes substantial changes to epigenetic marks, so that very effectiveness disrupt normal epigenetic development during those sensitive periods, causing abnormal development of gametes, embryo and embryonic stem cells, implantation and foetal development. That is likely to harm the children or even grandchildren of those receiving the treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to <em>The Economist</em> article, Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent.  It removes methyl groups from some cytosine bases in CpG dinucleotides of DNA. Inappropriate methylation of DNA at CpG islands can contribute to cancer by inactivating tumour suppressor genes - preventing transcription of those genes, reducing production of cell proteins that regulate the cell cycle and normal cell-death.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands can be inherited by daughter cells during mitosis.</p>
<p>Decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  That in turn reduces the over-methylation of CpG islands at promoter sites for tumor suppressor genes such a TP53.  Such genes protects cells from one step on the path to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at the ICR of the <em>paternal</em> allele for chromosome 11 prevents CTCF insulator protein from binding, allowing enhancers to loop back and <em>promote Igf2</em>.  Paternal ICR methylation also spreads downstream to <em>silence H19</em>.</p>
<p>Methylation at the ICR of the <em>maternal</em> allele allows CTCF to bind sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers, instead the enhancers <em>promote H19</em>.</p>
<p>Hyper- or hypo-methylation of DNA at Imprint Control Regions, can reduce expression of growth-limiting genes and the over-expression of growth-promoting genes. This is a common early event in pre-neoplastic tissue for example in the hypermethylation of ICR resulting in Igf2 over-expression in Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>Enhancer blocking can bring about the imprinted disorder called Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome by up-regulating Igf2, an oncogene, in the H19/Igf2 cluster via the upstream Kcnq1, even though Kcnq1 itself actually codes a tumour suppressor. The effect of Kcnq1 in Beckwith Wiedemann is to cause the maternal H19/Igf2 custer to act more like the paternal version, over-promoting Igf2 which promotes cell growth.  Cdkn1c, a tumour suppressor, is also down-regulated when Kcnq1 is coded incorrectly, again increasing the risk of cancer.</p></div>
