    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic control and results serious malfunction can result in detrimental outcomes such as cancer. DNA methylation in healthy, non-cancerous cells at CpG islands (CGIs) is usually scarce since most methylation is found at repetitive elements and intragenic regions.</p>
<p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CGIs found in promoters is maintaining optimal gene expression. A normally methylated (that is, scarcely methylated) CpG-rich promoter of a tumour-suppressor will produce enough of the tumour-suppressor. However, hypermethylation of CGIs at this promoter would reduce expression of the tumour-suppressor (notable examples include RB, MLH1, BRCA1) and would constitute a one 'hit' (per the Knudson hypothesis) towards developing cancer. For instance, hypermethylation of CGI in the RB promoter will reduce the amount of retinoblastoma protein present in cells, which in turn will disrupt the cell cycle checkpoint between G1 and S phases. Cells will enter S phase when they shouldn't and begin DNA replication, eventually undergo mitosis and may become cancerous.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions can contain transposons and various remnants of promoters which contribute to transcriptional noise. Normal DNA methylation at these sites (abundant) keeps the transposons at bay by preventing inappropriate recombination between repeats and transposition. It also prevents activation of cryptic promoters, inhibits antisense transcription. All in all, it maintains genomic stability. In cancer this stability is destroyed by genome-wide hypomethylation which leaves these regions unmethylated and prone to recombination, transposition and activation of cryptic promoters. For example, mutations in DNMT3B (de novo methyltransferase) result in genomic instability which is found in ICF syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting results in specific parent-of-origin expression. Disruption of this can cause aberrant expression of genes and may result in tumour development. This is evident in the imprinted expression of H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>The maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster is defined by having no methylation at the imprint control region (ICR). This allows the binding of an insulator protein CTCF to the ICR which in turn redirects the activity of enhancers from the Igf2 gene to the long non-coding RNA H19. Thus, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. In contrast, the ICR at the paternal allele is methylated and CTCF cannot bind to it. H19 is also partially methylated. Therefore, enchancers act on Igf2 and promote its expression. So, in normal cells Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, Igf2 is upregulated. Cells end up having two functioning paternal alleles and no maternal allele. This can occur genetically by way of mutation, deletion or epigenetically with loss of imprinting and methylation of ICRs at both alleles. Twofold expression of Igf2 leads to oncogenic activity. This allows cells to grow and proliferate faster thereby becoming tumours and leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetics is so important in regulating normal cell physiology it is logical that when disrupted it forms a major component of pathophysiology. This means that drugs targeting epigenetic mechanisms can function as effective treatments if molecules which regulate those mechanisms are 'druggable' (that is, it's possible to block their function with small molecules). Indeed, several such drugs have been tested and approved by the FDA. </p>
<p>Decitabine is one such drug. It functions by reducing the levels of DNA methylation. It acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNBTi) and blocks the function of molecules (DNMTs) which lay down methyl groups on cytosine nucleotides. One way how DNMTi might achieve this is by reducing methylation of CpG islands of tumour-suppressor promoters, like RB or p53. This would increase the amount of tumour-suppressors present in cells and provide necessary protection against aberrant cell proliferation which defines tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and is maintained by a specific DNA methyltransferase - DNMT1. So, if a drug were to suddenly result in hypomethylation of a particular part in the genome that part would remain hypomethylated in all other daughter cells derived from that single cell. DNMT1s simply wouldn't have the starting point needed to reinstate the epigenetic mark on a newly synthesized DNA strand.</p>
<p>Meddling with DNA methylation could be dangerous when the whole genome is undergoing change. Such periods when epigenetic marks are being removed (either actively or passively) and then reinstated are called sensitive periods. There are two known sensitive periods which occur throughout a human life. The first one happens in pre-implantation and early post-implantation stage of early development while the second takes place during germ-cell development and gamete formation. The first one clears gamete-specific marks and allows totipotency, and the second one sets up parent-specific marks to be transferred to the offspring. Using epigenetic drugs during these periods could result in detrimental changes in the epigenome and alter the formation of the organism if disrupted early in development or damage the offspring if disrupted during germ-cell development.</p></div>
