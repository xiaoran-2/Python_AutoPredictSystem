    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands were meant to inhibit expression of particular gene that resides around the islands.</p>
<p>In cancer, abnormalities occur when CpG islands near gene that involves in tumour suppression became over-methylated, causing the tumour suppressor gene being silenced and tumour suppressor factor not being expressed.</p>
<p>Since in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements would be hypermethylated, the cancer cells in contrast, these regions is hypomethylated. These are one of Knudson’s postulate by which multiple causes can result in cancer/ other diseases</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine demethylates DNA, puts it in class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>It inhibits DNA methylation – as mentioned at Dacogen’s website – thus decreasing methylation concentration of DNA. The hypomethylation effect induced by decitabine in neoplastic cells can re-establish normal function of genes that is important for cellular regulation.</p>
<p>Since tumour results from uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation, decitabine can pretty much inhibit it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Yes, it is possible that drugs altering DNA methylation can affect way longer than period of treatment. Consider a mutagen – post-exposure of mutagen can really hurt you for like, years. The key is “permanent damage to DNA sequence/ methylation and is inheritable to daughter cells”.</p>
<p>Toddlers are the one you would avoid these kinds of treatments. Because they are in sensitive period – a period you should  not be exposed to any epigenetic modifier agents .</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the time when epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed; clearing and resetting happens here. It occurs during early embryonic development and during germ cell development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As you would know, there is difference between paternal allele and maternal allele methylation pattern of H19/Igf2.</p>
<p>Maternal allele will have unmethylated imprint control regions insulated by CTCF protein, protecting it from downstream enhancers, causing the enhancers to increase H19 expression.</p>
<p>For paternal allele, imprint control regions will normally methylated and CTCF does not bind to ICR, exposing Igf2 to the enhancer and activates Igf2</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor , H19 would be inactive and Igf2 is active on both alleles. According to Moulton et al. (1996) in their paper “Genomic imprinting and Wilms' tumor” these happen possibly through loss of heterozygosity or biallelic hypermethylation of H19</p></div>
