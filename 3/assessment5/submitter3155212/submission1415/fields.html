    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells show a number of abberations of their epigenomal state as compared to that of a normal cell. This can be elucdiated by the example of the methylation of CpG islands and of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell CpG islands are generally non-methylated (hypomethylated) and which effects, if being correlated to a promotor of a gene for example, the activation of the corresponding gene. In cancer cells however, CpG islands are often methylated (hypermethylated).</p>
<p>Since these hypermethylated CpG islands turn genes off, tumour suppressors might be inacvtivated in this process, which might eventually result in an uncontrolled cell-growth. The hypermethylation of tumour suppressors can vary between different types of cancer. One can also observe in tumours a spreading hypermethylation of CpG shores.</p>
<p>Furthermore gene imprinting is regulated by also DNA methylation whence in cancer cells hypermethylation can yield to aberrant imprinting and thus to an under- or overregulation of a gene, depending of the particular pathway, and the lost of tissue specificity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The situation is reverse for the methylation state of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These parts of the genome of a normal cell are generally methylated in order to enhance genomic stability while in cancer cells one can observe a hypomethylation in these parts of the DNA.</p>
<p>The the loss of methylation increases with tumourgenicity and its impact depends on the locus. But in general this yields to illegitimate recombinations, an activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, and thus a destabilization of the genome and activation of previous inactive genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hence as a rule of thumb one observes a genome hypomethylation and a local hypermethylation of the DNA in a tumour, yielding an enhancement of cell-growth promoting genes, a down regulation of cell-growth suppressing genes and a destabilization of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene imprinting means the mitotically inheritable inactivation of alleles depending on its parental origin. In cancer cells imprinting can be disturbed which I try to explain by the example of the H19/Igf cluster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of the following elements: the Igf2 gene, the imprint control region (ICR), the H19 gene and enhancers. I describe first the two parental alleles and their methylation pattern in a normal cell:</p>
<p>On the maternal allel, the ICR is methylated and thus enabling the protein CTCF to bind at the ICR. This ICR/CTCF complex blocks the enhancers off the Igf2 site, and thereby silencing its expression, so as to they enhance only the expression of the H19 gene resulting in a lncRNA.</p>
<p>On the paternal allel, the situation is inverse in that the ICR and the H19 promoter are methylated. The methylation of the ICR disables the CTCF to bind it and thus making the way free for the enhancers to promote the expression of Igf2, while the methylated H19 promoter results in an inactivation of this gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the ICRs and the H19 promoters on both parental alleles are methylated, yielding a doubled expression of Igf2 and thus excessive cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer-cells show an aberrant epigenomic state which can be used to treat the disease. This I try to explain by the example of Decitabine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). This drug is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor which means that this drug inhibits methylation of DNA. Since one of the hallmarks of cancer  cells is the hypermethylation of CpG islands, and thereby inactivating tumour suppressors, e.g., this drug can stop the hypermethylation of DNA in a mitotically heritable fashion. In addition one would observe a passive demethylation of the DNA in the process of cell division since the newly replicated DNA strands would remain unmethylated in the presence of a methytransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore some patients treated with epigenetic anti-tumour drugs respond better to standard chemotherapy, possibly due to the altered epigenomical state of their DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable by the following process: If methylizated DNA is replicated the original strands remain their methylation state while the new strand is unmethylated. Some DNA methytranferases, such as DNMT1, especially recognize hemimethylated DNA and add a methylgroup to the unmethylated site of the strand. Thus the replicated DNA develops the same methylation state as the original one. So if a drug changes DNA methylation this change can have an effect beyond the period of treatment due to heritability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are periods in cell development during which the DNA undergoes re-programming of its epigenome by erasure of its methylation marks and the subsequent re-methylation of the approbiate sites of the DNA, for example in order to make the cell totipotent or during gene imprinting. These periods are called sensitive.</p>
<p>In mammals sensitive periods are for example during pre-implatation development and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So if during a sensitive period a DNA methylation inhibitor is given, the methylation marks would be erased from the DNA but due to the inhibitory nature of the drug the cell couldn't be properly re-methylated. Hence such an aberrantly methylated cell might fail to develop properly. If this happens in a germ cell this might effect even the following generation.</p></div>
