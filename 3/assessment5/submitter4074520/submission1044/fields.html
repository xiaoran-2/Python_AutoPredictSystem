    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It's a cytidine analog  that works by incorporating into the DNA strand of <span>abnormal hematopoietic cells</span>. Decitabine achieves anti-tumour effects via two mechanisms. At high doses, it directly leads to the death of abnormal cells. At low doses, it acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor through a convalent binding with DNMTs, diluting the methyl groups in the genome and reducing the extent of genetic silencing. Thus, it can reactivate genes (especially tumour suppressor genes) with aberrant methylation. </p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG sites refers to the addition of methyl groups to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides found in about 60% percent of promoters. Normally, CpG islands in the promoters of expressed genes are methylated as DNA methylation in promoter CpG islands always leads to silencing. This function is the basis for epigenetic phenomena like imprinting, X inactivation etc. which require the formation of functional or constitutive heterochromatin. However, in cancer cells, epigenetic enzymes such as methyltransferases are mutated and aberrant DNA methylation occurs. As a result of stable mitotic inheritance and rapid selections of epimutations, promoter CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes are often hypermethylated , and the transcription of the genes are inhibited. This can aleternatively happen in promoter CpG islands of a set of genes with DNA methylation in unusually high frequency (termed CIMP) and the surrounding regions of CpG islands. These methylation marks accumulate over time and become one of the multiple hits that cause cancers.</p>
<p>DNA methylation can also occur in intergeneic regions and repetitive elements. In intergenc regions, methylation helps to mantain genomic stability by preventing deletions, translocations etc. It also silences the cryptic transcription start sites to prevent interference with normal transcription process. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation helps to avoid transpositions through mutation of cytosine or direct silencing of repeats. Furthermore, DNA methylation silences repeats to prevent the interference caused by their strong promoters and illegitimate recombinations of similar repeats. In tumours, the mutation of epigenetic enzymes leads to hypomethylation in these regions. In consequence, reactivated repetitive elements cause genome-wide instability, causing a variety of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster carries out imprinting via a mechanism called enhancer blocking. The ICRs of H19/Igf2 cluster are upstream of H19 and downstream of Igf2. On the paternal strand, the ICR is methylated and the methylation extends to H19, causing silencing of this gene. Enhancers could then access Igf2, a growth-promoting gene, and activate it. On the maternal strand, the ICR is unmethylated and binds to an insulator protein named CTCF, which then blocks the interaction of enhancers and Igf2. As a result, the enhancers bind to H19 and Igf2 is silenced maternally. In pre-neoplastic tissues of Wilm's tumour, mutation of epigenetic enzymes causes aberrant DNA methylation and therefore loss of imprinting. The ICR on maternal strand is then methylated as on paternal strand, leading to activation of maternal Igf2 and silencing of maternal H19. Thus, Igf2 is overexpressed from two strands and the overexpression causes the characteristic overgrowth symptom in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can be maintained in the epigenome though mitotic inheritance. During cell division, the epigenetic enzyme DNA methyltransferase binds to the original strand and the daughter strand, and pass the methylation marks to the daughter strand via enzymatic reactions.</p>
<p>However, there are two periods during which the epigenetic marks are erased and re-established in a different way to ensure the totipotency of the cells. These two periods, primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development, are called sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. It is unwise to use the drugs to treat patients during sensitive periods (mainly adolescence and peri-conceptional periods, when PGC cells or pre-implantation embryo might be exposed to environmental factors). As the drug is a methyltransferase inhibitor that not necessarily selective, it may disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming in normal germ cells or embryonic cells, resulting in various epigenetic abnormalities such as imprinted disorder. Consequently, lots of diseases may arise. </p></div>
