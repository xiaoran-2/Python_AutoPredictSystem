    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation at C5 position of cytosine bases correlates to heterochromatin formation, X chromosome inactivation and imprinting. However the specific mechanism by which this biochemical modification excerpts this function varies. Promoter methylation at genomic CG rich regions, termed CpG islands, inversely correlates to gene expression. On the other hand, base methylation in intergenic regions or repetitive elements protects DNA from recombination at this sites.</p>
<p>In normal cells, promoter methylation at CpG islands occurs in some genes but is mostly low. On the contrary, intergenic regions are protected from recombination and transposable elements by high levels of methylation. Notwithstanding, cancer cells are quite different. DNA methylation machinery is dysregulated so that it methylates regions previously unmethylated and erroneously copies methylation patterns resulting in previously methylated unmethylated regions.</p>
<p>Since CpG islands methylation at promoters represses gene expression, genes involved in cellular growth regulation with promoter CpG islands methylation means a lowered level of proteins involved in this function. Some of these genes are called tumour suppressors because they stop cellular growth and replication. CpG islands methylation can also occur at promoters of genes involved in DNA repair, which consequently implies a diminished efficacy of DNA reparation machinery and hence perpetuation of DNA damage.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements increases the risk of bizarre translocations or recombinations. These regions make up great part of the genome. Moreover, some intergenic regions carry DNA elements that codify for non-coding RNAs, some of which are important in regulating cell growth. These regions can be target of transposable elements and therefore produce alterations in open reading frames, in DNA elements that regulate transcription or even in RNA splicing abnormalities. Since repetitive elements are similar throughout the genome, these regions are prone to homologous recombinations. Bizarre recombinations can in turn alter chromosomal architecture.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, a differentially methylated region (DMR) downstream the H19 allele is methylated. Methylation of this DMR allows the insulator protein, CTCF, to bind the imprint control region (ICR) that separates H19 allele from the upstream Igf2 allele, insulating them and resulting in maternal repression of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the paternal DMR downstream H19 remains unmethylated and the ICR between this gene and the Igf2 gene come to be methylated. This ICR requires to be methylated in order to be bound by CTCF and insulate the Igf2 gene from the enhancers downstreams. The H19 paternal allele is repressed.</p>
<p>The Igf2 gene codes for the insulin-like growth factor 2 and overexpression of this hormone is straightforward implicated in overgrowth of tissues, stimulation of growth and cancer cell proliferation. Wilm’s tumour is one of these examples. If maternal expression of Igf2 is not blocked, the result is an increased blood level of the hormone. This could happen if the DMR downstream the H19 allele suffers any modification or the CTCF no longer can insulate these two genes; in other words, if imprinting at this gene cluster cannot occur</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent: it removes methyl groups from the C5 of cytosines. Also it can inhibit DNA methyltransferases. In abnormally hypermethylated regions this would imply restoring the expression of silenced genes.</p>
<p>The antitumour effect of this drug is the capability of restoring the expression of tumor supressors or DNA reparing enzymes previously silenced, hence reestablishing part of the cell growth regulation and genomic stability.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable mark, which means daughter cells acquire the same methylation profile as their mother. After replication, the mother DNA strand acts as a template for DNA methyltransferases, replicating then the methylation profile of its mother. The result is a daughter strand identical to the mother. Conversely, any abnormality in DNA methylation profile in the mother strand will also be copied to the daughter strand, which mean, if a cell with a bizarre methylation phenotype replicates, the resulting cells will carry the same abnormalities.</p>
<p>Once established, DNA methylation cannot suffer modifications. However this is neither true at all times nor in all cells. It has been shown that germ cells go through periods of methylation remodeling which are indeed sensitive to the environment. Periods of time which are known to be sensitive periods include early stages of embryonic development and childhood (especially before the puberty). Some epigenetic reprogramming also occur with aging.</p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenome modifying drugs during sensitive periods would alter DNA methylation not only at regions responsible for the pathologic phenotype but globally, which might fix some of the underlying abnormality but will surely add on a lot of bizarre epigenomic changes</p></div>
