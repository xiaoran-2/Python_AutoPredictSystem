    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer, with an increase of methylation at CpG islands and a decrease in methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands, typically located in promoters, is to silence of gene expression. In normal cells, most CpG islands are not methlyated. In cancer, however, there is hypermethylation at CpG islands. These silenced CpG islands may normally promote tumor-suppressing genes; in cancerous cells, these promoters may be silenced. Additionally, alterations in DNA methylation at imprint control regions can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. Normally the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated; in cancer, however, there is hypomethylation of these regions. Methylation of these regions keeps the genome stable, preventing such phenomena as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighboring genes. All of these phenomena are present in cancerous DNA, destabilizing the DNA in cells where the disease is present.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by affecting which genes are expressed and which are silenced. For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated in normal cells, suppressing expression of the H19 gene. The enhancers downstream of the ICR and H19 enhance the Igf2 gene. In a normal maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF is able to bind to it, activating the downstream enhancers to enhance the H19 gene. Unlike in the paternal allele, the Igf2 gene is not expressed. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR is methylated, just as it is in the paternal allele, so in both alleles, Igf2 is expressed and H19 is suppressed. In normal cells, the expressed H19 gene in the maternal allele suppresses growth, whereas the expressed Igf2 gene in the paternal allele promotes growth. In a cell where imprinting has been disrupted in Wilm's tumor, since H19 is suppressed and Igf2 is doubly expressed, there is an overexpression of growth promoting genes. These growth promoting genes contribute to the increased growth of cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which can lead to acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Much is still unknown about the mechanisms by which this drug works, but it has been quite effective in treating cancer. By inhibiting DNMT in CpG islands, decitabine prevents the hypermethylation of these areas, thereby disinhibiting tumor suppressing genes. Decitabine acts universally on DNMT, so it not only targets hypermethylated CpG islands, but also other methylated areas of the genome that are not affected by cancer. Longterm effects of this drug are as yet unknown. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. The changes made to one cell will be inherited by all daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter cells, thus propogating the effects over generations. Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Patients experiencing a sensitive period of development should avoid taking epigenetic drugs. A sensitive period is a time when the altered environments have an effect on epigenetic controls. Generally sensitive periods occur when epigenetic marks are being established. Such periods include the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, once epigenetic marks are removed, as well as during primordial germ cell development, once imprinting and epigenetic marks are removed. Changes to the epigenome during these periods may have widespread effects on future development. Much as fetuses starved in the peri-conceptional period during the Dutch Famine of 1944 grew to have increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, exposure to other epigenetic changes during a sensitive period can have lifelong effects, so it is inadvisable to administer epigenetic drugs during a sensitive period. </p></div>
