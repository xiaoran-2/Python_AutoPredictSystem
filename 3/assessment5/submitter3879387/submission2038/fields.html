    <h1>Submission 2038 from Anon (session_user_id: faeac53479cb8c3ba98c40dff3114d5c0d6b7192)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and treats myelodysplastic syndrome that is progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia. These inhibitors are nucleoside analogues. During DNA replication when DNMT1 comes to bind to DNA nucleotides, presence of DNMTi causes that DNA methyltransferase bind irreversibly and can no longer be released. Therefor new strands of DNA do not inherit DNA methylation. Since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than other cells of body and replicate more, the effect of DNMTi will be more on them. The mechanism of action of these inhibitors is still unclear. The dosage of DNMTi is very important in its anti-neoplastic effect. High dosages of it are really toxic with bad side effects and have no specific anti-tumor effect. But when lower doses are used, they cause DNA demethylation and have a very good anti-tumor effect and kill the neoplasm cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands which are found in most of gene promoters, independent to their activity state, are usually not methylated. It means that the gene is active. In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated, and then it causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This is one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis. CGI hypermethylation oftentimes occurs in cancer cells. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; it leads to epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes. The cells with this epimutation are more probable to divide rapidly and to not die as much as surrounding tissues do.</p>
<p>In normal repetitive elements and intergenic regions, the genome is methylated; but in cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated. The outcome of these hypomethylation depends on where it is happening. Genome-wide hypomethylation was the first epigenetic abnormality that was found in the 80s. It happens early in tumorogenesis and progresses by time. We know that DNA methylation maitains genomic stability; so hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability. One result can be illegitimate recombination between repeats; such as reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes. But in normal cells, the repetitive elements are highly methylated and heterochromatonized (the chromatin is not open), so similar or identical chromosomes cannot align together and this recombination wouldn't occur. Activation and transposition of repeats is the second result of hypomethylation. These can lead to transcriptional abnormality in surrounding genes. For example cryptic promoters would become active and or neighboring genes would be disrupted. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is found in sites upstream of H19 in paternal allele; but these promoter sites are demethylated in maternal allele. Therefor in normal paternal cells, Igf2 is expressed and H19 is not expressed. And in maternal cells, H19 is expressed and Igf2 is not expressed. In wilm's tumor, epigenotype of maternal chromosome changes to paternal type (the H19 promoter is methylated, Igf2 is on, H19 is off) which leads to increasing cell growth. It is called loss of imprinting of H19. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="rtl" style="text-align:right;">Sensitive period of DNA methylation occurs in germ line development. So treating younger patients during their sensitive periods is inadvisable because it would inhibit the epigenetic machinery. It harms germ cells and can affect adult's fertility and health of the offspring.  </p></div>
