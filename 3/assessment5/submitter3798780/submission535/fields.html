    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is stable epigenetic mark that is passed down to the subsequent generations (mitoticaly heritable). It is laid down by enzyme DNMT3 on 5’ group of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and maintained by DNMT1 that prefers semi-methylated DNA as substrate in daughter cells.</p>
<p>CpGs are clustered into CpG islands, frequently found in promoters of the genes, and tend to be protected from methylation in the normal cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, global level of methylation of locus specific CGIs increases (alternative to genetic mutation), that leads to silence of tumour suppressor genes that are required to make cell die, or decrease proliferation. It occurs early and progress with time (tumorigenesis).</p>
<p>Hypermethylated CGIs lead to formation of repressive chromatin structure by binding proteins e.g. MeCP1 and MeCP2, that have DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain, or hypermethylated CGIs can prohibit transcription factor binding.</p>
<p>Hypermethylated CGIs of tumour suppressor genes have been found in many human cancers e.g: RB in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1, MGMT…</p>
<p>Alteration of DNA methylation of a small number of imprinted genes can lead to increased mental and metabolic disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repetitive elements, intergenic regions and intrones of the coding genes, are methylated genome-wide in the normal cells.</p>
<p>Methylation is required for genomic stability by preventing illegitime recombinations between repeats, deletions, duplications and insertions.</p>
<p>In cancer, all those elements are found to be hypomethylated. It leads to genomic instability by illegitime recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions that cause disruption of the coding region of the genes, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Evidences that hypomethylation leads to genomic instability related to cancer and other disorders are numerous.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation due to deletion of DNMT1 in mouse model leads to developing of cancer in specific tissue.                                                                                                                                         Mutation in DNMT3B in humans results in genomic instability and occurring of ICF syndrome (immunodeficiency and cranio-facial defect syndrome).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is monoallelic gene expression, based on parent-of-origin specific way. Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs), that control expression of imprinted genes. H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted (ICR of paternal chromosome is methylated) and controlled by enhancers blocking.</p>
<p>Methylation of paternal ICR prevents binding of CTCF insulator protein. This enables access of downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 gene. Furthermore, methylation spreads from ICR downstream into promoter of H19 lncRNA and silence it’s expression.</p>
<p>Maternal ICR remains unmethylated that makes it free for binding of CTCF which isolates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. By blocking Igf2 loop of the first choice, enhancers are free to activate H19, as a second preference.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting by hypo- or hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 cluster results in double expression of Igf2, (apperience of two paternal alleles and loss of maternal one). Overexpression of growth promoting Igf2 gene (oncogene), may lead to embryonic, or childhood tumours of kidney, known as Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>Many of imprinted genes are involved in growth reguation and are commonly expressed in placenta and brain. Disorder of imprinting causes various abnormalities: cancer, developmental and mental disorders. Disruption in H19/Igf2 imprinting may result in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with characteristic fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia and predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNMTi (DNA methyltransferasis inhibitors) that are nucleoside analogues, very similar to 5-azacytidine.This small molecule is targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulator, DNMT1 by getting  incorporated into DNA during replication, therefore cell division dependent and binding DNMT1 irreversibly, thus resulting in passive demethylation of tumour suppressors.</p>
<p>Decitabine used in lower concentrations has shown excellent results in treating of MDS (Myeloplastic syndrome), precursor of AML (acute myeloid leukemia), possibly through demethylation of hypermethylated CpGs, MDS is depended on. In that way, it is killing tumour cells, resulting in good anti-neoplastic effect.</p>
<p>Anti-tumour effect might occur as a result of long lasting alteration of tumour cells, that makes them susceptible to standard chemotherapy, as well.</p>
<p>This is possible as epigenetic marks are stable and mitoticaly heritable, still reversible and therefore open to epigenetic drug treatment.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is very stable epigenetic mark that is laid down by DNMT3 and maintained by DNMT1 that prefers semi-methylated DNA as substrate in daughter cells. Alterations of DNA methylation are mitoticaly heritable and therefore lasting for the lifetime of organism. However, epimutations are reversible that makes them susceptible for the drug treatment. Those two characteristic of methylated DNA (stable + reversible mark) enables drugs to have effect that lasts beyond period of treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when clearance between generations takes place. In these periods reprogramming of both, maternal and paternal genome (removal and resetting of new epigenetic marks) occur.</p>
<p>There are two mayor sensitive periods of development: Pre-implantation period of embryo, (from zygote to blastocyst) when much of DNA methylation and histone marks are removed. After implantation, resetting of epigenetic marks in cell specific manner is established. Second sensitive period is period of primordial germ cells development at mid-gestation embryo, when somatic marks are removed and specific new marks laid, dependent of the sex of embryo.</p>
<p>Disruption of establishment of epigenetic marks in sensitive periods can have severe consequences for the lifetime of organism and can possibly be even transgenerationaly transmittable through the gametes. Environmental factors can alter epigenetic make up and this is the reason why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
