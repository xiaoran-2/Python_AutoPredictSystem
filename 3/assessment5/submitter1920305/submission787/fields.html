    <h1>Submission 787 from Anon (session_user_id: c60d0af8e9d58b3f552332ce25fdbfa87535cb26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>- Decitabine inhibits the action of DNMTs. It acts as a nucleoside  analog. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, it is actually bound irreversibly and cannot be released. Thus, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to next cell generations until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>- Decitabine alters the tumor cells in some lasting way making them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because epigenetic state is mitotically hereditable. So, if it is changed in one cell, then those changes will be copied to the next cell generations, the descendants of the epigenetically modified cell. </p>
<p>- A sensitive period for the epigenome is the time period that epigenetic reprogramming (clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks) takes place and for this reason epigenome is very susceptible to environmental influence.</p>
<p>- Sensitive periods of development in mammals are (a) early embryonic development and (b) primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>- Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because epigenetic reprogramming may be affected seriously guiding to an illegitimate phenotype, (e.g. a disease in the treated person).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is related to different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.</p>
<p>- In cancerous cells CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated.</p>
<p>- Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancerous cells can contribute to disease, because hypermethylation of tumor supressor promoter CpG islands causes silencing of the underlying genes, guiding to uncontrollable cell division and tumor growth.</p>
<p>-  The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">repetitive </span>elements is to provide genomic stability by the methylation and compaction of these regions of the genome.</p>
<p>- In cancerous cells intergenic regions and repetetive elements are usually hypomethylated.</p>
<p>- Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute to disease via genomic instability. Genomic instability includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, as well as activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so CTCF does not bind to ICR and Igf2 is expressed instead of H19.</p>
<p>- In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF binds to ICR and H19 is expressed instead of Igf2.</p>
<p>- In Wilm’s tumor the ICR of the maternal allele is methylated.</p>
<p>- In Wilm’s tumor due to the methylation of the ICR of the maternal allele CTCF does not bind to ICR and Igf2 is expressed instead of H19. So, Igf2 is over-expressed, because it is expressed both by the paternal and the maternal allele. Igf2 is a growth factor, so promotes tumor growth.</p></div>
