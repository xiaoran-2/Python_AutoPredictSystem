    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>About 60% of gene promoters contain CpG islands.  DNA methylation at CpG islands silences nearby genes by inactivating the promoter.</p>
<p>CpG islands are normally not methylated.  Cancer causes hypermethylation of CpG islands, however, thereby silencing the nearby genes.  The hypermethylation of CpG islands tends to be around promoters for tumor supressor genes.  By silencing tumor suppressor genes with this hypermethylation, the cancer is better able to grow.  Moreover, since the methylation is mitotically heritable, the cancer is able to pass this supression down to daughter cells.  This could be one of the hits required for active cancer, under the knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genomic stability by preventing recombination with other chromosomes and heterochromatizing (closing down or condensing) those repetitive and intergenic regions of the chromosome.  By removing this hypermethylation, cancer opens up the chromatin and encourages undesirable recombination, transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions, additional deletions, insertions, and general genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated.  The methylation prevents the insulator CTCF from binding to the ICR.  Because the insulator is absent, the gene enhancers that are downstream of the ICR can basically jump over the ICR, acting on the Igf2 gene that is upstream of the ICR.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated.  The insulator CTCF is thus free to bind to the ICR in the maternal allele, which insulates the Igf2 gene from the enhancer.  The enhancer is thus forcing it to act, instead, on the H19 gene that remains upstream of the insulator.  As a result of this (normal) imprinting, the Igf2 gene is expressed on one parental allele, but not the other.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the methylation of the ICR of the paternal allele is removed, allowing the enhancer to act on the Igf2 gene on the paternal allele as well as the maternal allele.  Thus, the gene Igf2 is over expressed, relative to a normal cell, resulting in an overproduction of the related growth factor.  This allows the cancer to grow faster than it otherwise could. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of inhibitors referred to as DNA demethylating agents.  The manner of action of Decitabine is not described in the article.  However, if Decitabine is similar to the other drugs described earlier in the article, then Decitabine inhibits EZH2 production, which in turn reduces histone hypermethylation that is a hallmark of a number of lymphomas.</p>
<p>Histone hypermethylation, a key to tumour development, causes silencing of nearby tumour suppressor genes.  Drugs such as Decitabine reduce the action of enzymes (EZH2) that cause the hypermethylation.  This allows the histone hypermethylation to subside, returning to histone to a more normal methylation state and thereby allowing the expression of the tumour suppressor genes to resume. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, thus the methylation pattern of a parent cell is passed down to daughter cells.  As a consequence, the methylation will persist following the period of treatment.</p>
<p>It would be undesirable to treat a pregnant patient during a sensitive period for the fetus, meaning one of the two periods during which epigenetic methylation marks are being removed from the genome of the fetus and reapplied.  Such sensitive periods are early embroionic development and primordial germ cell development of the fetus.  Treatment of pregnant patients during such periods could result in improper epigenetic reprogramming of the fetus genome, with unpredicatable, dangerous, and permanent effect on the development of the fetus. </p></div>
