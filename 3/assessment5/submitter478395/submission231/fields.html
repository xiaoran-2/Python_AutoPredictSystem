    <h1>Submission 231 from Anon (session_user_id: 7d947e843d18ca26dba4976d9e4d3c11d2169a77)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA-demethylating agents, like decitabine, is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. By demethylating DNA, Decitabine thus decreases DNA methylation. This can have an anti-tumor effect if the DNA that was methylated was something like a tumor suppressor gene. That methylation would shut down the gene and thus allow for tumor generation. By demethylating the gene, there is reduced gene methylation, and then increased tumor suppression, helping to treat MDP.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin has shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer.Some of the participants in the study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next. Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumor cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (e.g. involving transcription factors), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. It might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Thus, <span>altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</span></p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is one in which cells are normally going through genetic reprogramming - a time critical for normal development. Gametogenesis and early embryonic development would be examples of such periods. Treating patients during these sensitive periods could alter gem cells and have serious consequences for the developing organism.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin</span><span>. Typically, DNA methylation of promoter regions decreases gene expression</span><span>. Exceptions are CpG islands</span><span>. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation</span><span>. However, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene</span><span>. If this gene might code for a tumor suppressor, then the gene would be silenced, and tumor suppression would be compromised. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA</span><span>. <span>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of normal cells. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes either genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes or silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a genetic phenomenon by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. It may also ensure transposable elements remain epigenetically silenced throughout gametogenic reprogramming to maintain genome integrity. It is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are either expressed only from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother (e.g. H19), or in other instances from the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father (e.g. IGF-2). Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is a paternally expressed imprinted gene regulating fetal growth, playing an integral role in the development of many tissues including the brain. The parent-of-origin specific expression of Igf2 is largely controlled by allele-specific DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites in the imprinting control region (ICR), located immediately upstream of the neighboring H19 gene. The H19 gene, is situated downstream of Igf2 and expresses an miRNA, which can repress translation though silencing or degradation. The H19 gene is monoallelically expressed from the maternally inherited allele, therefore having the opposing imprint to the neighboring Igf2 gene. Disrupting imporinting can contribute to disease via overexpression of IGF2as seen in Wilms tumor. </p></div>
