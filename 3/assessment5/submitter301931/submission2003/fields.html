    <div class="field-value"><p>How is DNA methylation altered in Cancer?  In normal cellular function, there appears to be a general rule were methylation occurs in the intergenic and repetitive regions of the genome, however the CpG island regions of the genome are not methylated. The reciprocal or inverse appears to be true in cancer cells, where CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive element areas have a loss of methylation.  </p>
<p>As CpG islands are usually located in promoter regions, it follows that by changing from little methylation to heavy methylation of these regions or even spillover to the shores of CpG islands can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Loss of suppression will obviously have a deleterious effect on the ability of the organism to regulate cell growth. This process of hypermethylation varies in its intensity with the specific type of tumor.  </p>
<p>In general, most of the genome consists of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Due to the fact that these regions have a certain level of methylation in normal cells, it stands to reason that disruption and reduction of the methylation of these regions will lead to factors that contribute to disease, such as cancer. In fact, the hypomethylation of this region was the first epigenetic process discovered. A lack of methylation in these regions can lead to genetic instability thus increasing the likelihood of chromosomal insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations. Unlike the hypermethylation of CpG islands, the hypomethylation of these regions is not so specific and leads to a general structural instability. Hypomethylations occur early and progress with time.</p>
<p>The takeaway from the study of the role of DA methylation in cancer is that the process is context dependent and be positive or negative depending on the timing and location.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of Imprinting can also lead to cancer promotion. For example the H19/Igf2 cluster has a straightforward reaction to changes in methylation.</p>
<p>In the normal cell, the paternal allele’s Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated, which allows the downstream enhancers to activate the upstream Igf2 .</p>
<p>In contrast, in the normal cell, the maternal allele does not have methylation at the ICR, therefor the CTCF insulating elements bind to the ICR and the promoters activate the H19 gene. When this occurs, there is no expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm’s tumor when hypermethylation is expressed in the genome. The hypermethylation causes the maternal allele’s ICR to become methylated which then causes the allele to proceed in the same manner as the paternal allele. The CTCF elements do not bind to the ICF and the enhancers then activate the maternal copy of IGF2. This results in the cell receiving a double dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>Since Igf2 is related to growth promotion, it would be safe to assume that the double exposure of Igf2 is a contributing factor to the unregulated cell growth of the early childhood kidney tumor associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Economist article assigned for review discussed several drugs that have potential epigenetic benefit. One drug mentioned was Decitabine.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which means it removes methyl groups to the genome in question. This can be useful to combat some of the problems identified in the previous two questions. If there is a hypermethylation event occurring, a demethylating agent could possibly remove enough of the extra methyl groups to stabilize the genome back to the originally intended products. Therefore a hypermethylization at a CpG island could be controlled and enough of the tumor suppressors could be activated to give the cells enough time to deal with an elevated cell growth level. In Wilm’s tumor patients the maternal alleles could possibly be demethylated enough to have the double dose of Igf2 product eliminated to have cell growth remain close to normal.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome by altering the density of the nuclear packaging. If there is a problem that forces the intergenic and repetitive element regions to be hypomethylated, then there may be too many chances for insertions, deletions or translocations to take place, thus potentially altering a future progeny in an unknown manner. Lethality may even be a consequence.</p>
<p>A sensitive period means the period of development when the epigenetic marks are being reset in the genome.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods of development are the pre implantation developmental period and the primordial germ cell developmental period.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because there is an increased risk of developing genetic disorders such as imprinting disorders. Finding the correct level of genetic expression is extremely difficult because most if not all expression levels are being reset. Reprogramming is currently being studied in ART, cloning and induced pluripotent stem cell production.</p></div>
