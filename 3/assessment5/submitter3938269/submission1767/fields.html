    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are dense, CpG dinucleotide regions, usually found near the promoter región of tumor supresor genes (TSGs).They can be found in most cases upstream the start codon. <strong>Normally</strong> these <strong>CpG islands tend to be unmethylated</strong> thus DNA methylation is not present on these dinucloetides<strong> enabling gene expression</strong>. However in some malignancies (e.g. <strong>cancer</strong>) this<strong> unmethylated state of the CpG islands is changed into a highly methylated state</strong> (promoter hipermethylation) thus <strong>promoting the silencing of TSGs</strong> for example, and in consequence triggering cancer. In this cases where the CpG islands of certain genes are hypermethylated the <strong>transcription of these genes will be decreased or stopped</strong>, thus generating a smaller amount (or none) of certain protein, which, if absent, will geenerate a phenotype related to disease. It is also known that CpG island hypermethylation is related with a condensed state of chromatin so maybe the hypermethylation of a certain CpG island might lead to the silencing of other genes and in consequence generating disease.</p>
<p><strong>Normally, there is CpG methylation genome-wide</strong>, except on CpG islands as we have already metioned, this methylation is not as dense as that of CpG islands but it is more frequent throughout the genome and is related with genome stability. When this <strong>CpGs are methylated they prevent homologous recombination</strong> (for example) <strong>in regions like repetitive elements</strong>, but<strong> in cancer there is a global hypomethylation of these regions thus making normally unaccessible sites accesible for recombination and finally leading to genomic instability</strong> (duplications, insertions, deletions, etc.) This changes instability of the genome will lead, in cancer, to cells that might have different copies of oncogenes or genes related to cancer, or absence of TSGs. This<strong> changes in the dosage, presence, absence or up/down regulation of genes also contributes with other diseases</strong> besides cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <strong>imprinting control region  (ICR) of the patternal allele is methylated</strong> (Patternaly imprinted) thus not allowing CTCF to bind, the lncRNA H19 is also methylated due to DNA methylation spreading thus the enhancers are not able to act on it, they rather enhance the expression of Igf2. In the case of the<strong> maternal allele</strong> <strong>the ICR is unmethylated as well as H19</strong>, thus CTCF can bind to the ICR and thus the enhancers will act directly on the active H19 instead of Igf2 (like in the patternal allele). In the case of the Wilm´s tumor there is loss of imprinting and <strong>both alleles will behave as the parental allele</strong>, in other words <strong>both alleles will have hypermethylation of the ICR and the H19 genes thus enabling the enhancers to act on Igf2 in both maternal and paternal allele</strong>. This disruption will<strong> increase the dosage of Igf2 (x2)</strong> on the cells thus leading to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>demethylating agent</strong>, this means that it is a compound that <strong>works by binding to the enzymes that catalyze the methylation reaction</strong> (e.g. DNA methyltransferases) and consequently <strong>blocking its activity</strong>, thus resulting in a unmethylated state of the DNA after a series of replications. When used as therapy for certain type of cancer Decitabine can be used in order to <strong>re-activate tumor supresor genes</strong> that were <strong>once silenced by DNA hypermethylation</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Demethylating agents will remove all the methylaton marks that where stablished during the process of tumorogenesis but also they might affect <strong>normal tissue</strong> <strong>removing crucial methylation marks </strong>established since eary development or during diferentiation<strong> that will not be reestablised</strong>. If by any chance this type of therapy is administrated during a sensitive period, the consequences will be worse. A sensitive period is when <strong>epigenetic marks need to be established and/or removed actively across the genome</strong> and there are two different sensitive periods, during <strong>Germ cell developement and during Early developement. </strong>If demethylating agents are used during this periods there will be no mechanism available to establish the propper normal epigenetic marks (methylation specifically). If the treatment is used in a person which is <strong>fertile</strong> then the <strong>consequences will be only limited to the germ cells</strong> which will probably make the person <strong>esterile</strong> since the germ cells (first sensitive period) will not be able to develope normally. If the person is a female and it is <strong>pregnant</strong> this <strong>treatments should be avoided</strong> because the <strong>germ cells are not the only ones that would be affected but also the developing embryo</strong> (second sensitive period).</p></div>
