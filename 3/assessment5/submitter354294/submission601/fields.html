    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In a normal cell</strong> we see <strong>hypo</strong>methylation of <strong>CpG islands</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer</strong> <strong>CpG island methylation</strong> generally <strong>increases</strong>.  Which specific CpG islands will be methylated - differs with the type of tumors, and this can be used as a biomarker.  In some cancers a whole set of genes is disrupted, and by looking for these sets we can determine what kind of cancer a patient has.  CpG island shores - areas immediately upstream and downstream - are also hypermethylated in cancer, and this may serve as even better biomarkers.</p>
<p><strong>Methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer</strong> by silencing tumor supressor genes - we usually find this new methylation in the promoters of these genes.  It's mitotically heritable.  Cells with this epimutation have a competitive advantage when compared to normal cells - they divide more rapdly and don't die as much.  It occurs in tumors (as opposed to many cancers that don't form tumors) and has been found in practically all tumors studied so far.</p>
<p><strong>In a normal cell</strong> we see <strong>hyper</strong>methylation in <strong>intergenic regions</strong> and <strong>repetitive elements</strong> - the genom is generally methylated there, even between introns.  This prevents illegitimate recombination between repeats.</p>
<p><strong>In cancer</strong> <strong>intergenic regions</strong>, <strong>repetitive elements</strong>, and even the area between introns <strong>are hypomethylated</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements </strong>introduces genomic instability: illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and neighboring genes.  Chromosomes in general recombine (exchange pieces) when they have similar areas.  Repeats are similar - naturally.  In healthy cells they are methylated, and this prevents recombination.  In cancer this is absent, and this results in cancer-promoting genetic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For Igf2, <strong>on the paternal allele</strong> the imprint control region is methylated, and the transcriptional repressor CTCF will not bind to it.  Then the enhancers, which are futher downstream, are not blocked from reaching the Igf2 region, and Igf2 is expressed on this allele.</p>
<p><strong>On the maternal allele</strong> the imprint control region is not methylated, and CTCF will bind to it and thus prevent the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 area.  The enhancers will act on H19 instead, and Igf2 will not be expressed on this allele.</p>
<p>Putting this together, in a normal cell only one allele, the paternal one, expresses Igf2, because only one allele has the imprint control region methylated.</p>
<p><strong>In Wilm's tumor</strong> cells this imprinting is disrupted - on both alleles the imprint control region is methylated.  <strong>This leads to overexpression of Igf2</strong>, because it is now generated from both alleles, not just from one.  Igf2 is growth-promoting, which in the end leads to uncontrolled growth and a kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As an epigenetc inhibitor, Decitabine belongs to the <strong>class of DNA-demethylating agents</strong> (specifically, <strong>DNMTi</strong>).</p>
<p>Decitabine <strong>decreases methylation</strong> of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  It is believed that it does that by directly incorporating into DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used for treating myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  It is believed that in neoplastic cells Decitabine <strong>returns normal function of the genes that control of cellular proliferation and differentiation</strong>.  Decitabine is incorporated into DNA, and DNMT binds to it, but now it binds irreversibly and its futher action is blocked.  This process is therefore dependent on cell division and is most active in cells that divide most - which are cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methilation is mitotically stable (is preserved when cells divide), it can have <strong>enduring effects</strong> on the epigenome. Any effect that is achieved by medical drugs can persist after the treatment is ended.  The changes are already there in the epigenome, and they are now copied by the cell machinery for subsequent cell generations even though there is no drug in the system.</p>
<p>A <strong>sensitive period</strong> in development is a period when environment has the biggest influence on the important epigenetic marks.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of sensitive periods</strong> are primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm, preimplantation and postimplantation periods, and, most important here, the slow growth period - the time before the start of puberty. </p>
<p><strong>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable</strong> for the plain reason that modern drugs do now have a highly selective action.  Our main and only purpose is to change epigenome so that cancer is gone.  We don't have drugs that do only that.  All existing drugs change methylation elsewhere, too.  If we apply these drugs during sensitive periods (in children before puberty, say), the side effects can be not only severe but will also persist long after the treatment is over - forever even.</p></div>
