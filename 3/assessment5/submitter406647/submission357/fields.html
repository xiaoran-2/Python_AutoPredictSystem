    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands usually leads to gene silencing, recruitiing other protein to condense chromatins and prohibiting transcrption factor binding, thus alters gene expression. In cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands impacted regulatory gene expression, resulting in over expression of unwanted protein. At intergenic region, DNA methylation functions to maintain the genomic integrity. At repetitive element, in addition to maintaining genomic integrity, it also prevent genome from transposable elements. During cancer cell proliferation, DNA hypomethylation was found genome-wide at interigenic regions as well as repeats. This abberration disruppted the  protein expression regulation and caused overexpression of oncogene/suppression of tumor suppressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>when H19, on maternal allele, gets expressed, an insulator protein, CTCF, would insulate Igf2 on the maternal allel from enhancer. The expression of Igf2 of the paternal allel, which lacks CTCF, would activae Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. For example, CpG island and island shore hypermethylation is frequently seen in cancer cells. By reducing the level of DNA methylation, this drug can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Thus slows down te growth rate of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation, hypo- or hypermethylation, results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes. Sensitive period refers to the time period during development when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Two sensitive periods exist, which are preimplantation period--early development and primordial germ cell development. DNA methylation is inheritable. Treatment during the sensitive period would alter DNA methylation level and cause long-term effect to the protein expression, which sometimes are unfavorable.</p></div>
