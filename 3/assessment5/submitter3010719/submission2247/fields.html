    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal healthy cell, oncogenes (tumor encouraging genes) are silenced by DNA methylation of the CpG island near its promoter and for the same reasons, genes that prevent cancer from developing have their CpG islands unmethylated (so that they are expressed). In cancerous cells, the reverse is true, i.e. the CpG islands of promoters of oncogenes and tumor suppressive genes are unmethylated and methylated (respectively). The expression and/or silencing of these genes leads to a cancerous phenotype in the cell (for example, uncontrolled growth). <br /><br />On the other hand, DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and on repetitive elements helps give the DNA stability against all sorts of mutations which could damage the DNA (translocations, activation of repeats, etc.). When this methylation is removed, genetic damage may accumulate, and genetic damage is part of tumorigensis. Moreover, the genetic damage could in turn damage the epigentic machinery which would in turn promote tumorigensis in the above-mentioned ways.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal allele Igf2 is expressed through CpG island methylation of the H19 promoter, and on the maternal allele, you have the same island unmethylated, so that H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silenced. In Wilm's tumour, what happens is imprinting is lost through hypermethylation so that both alleles will have Igf2 expressed, which is a growth promoting gene, and it is this double dosage that leads to the cancer known as Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This drug can be used as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes, which is a precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. By indiscriminantly reducing the amount of methylation in the DNA, some tumor suppressive genes will be unsilenced which will slow down the advance of the cancer. As I understand things, this would also have some unfortunate side effects on the rest of the genome, since some genes should be silenced instead of expressed, and moreover, the stability of the genome will be reduced due to decreased methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Luckily these effects tend to be small at the right dosage and in older patients.<br /></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigentic treatments can have lasting impact because the role of DNMT1 is to maintain methylation marks, even through mitosis. So if some methylation marks are removed or added, even when the cell divides, those marks will be passed down to the daughter cells so long as DNMT1 is active. Histone modifications treatments may be less persistent after treatment since there is no analogous enzyme to DNMT1 in this respect (at least none that are as reliable). The particular cancer that these treatments deal with are driven by hypermethylation and so using the treatment at the stage where the tumor is driven by this (and not hypomethylation) is ideal and effective. Also, it is best to not use these treatments in young people or pregnant women because this could have effects on the germ lines by hypomethylating things that shouldn't be (loss of imprinting could occur for example).</p></div>
