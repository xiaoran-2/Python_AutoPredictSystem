    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The term DNA methylation refers to the epigenetic modification of cytosines characterized by addition of a methyl (CH3) group at position C5 of the cytosine base. DNA methylation is a mark of silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>CpG islands (CGIs), normally found in promoters of genes, are usually hypomethylated in healthy cells. Because of this hypomethylation the genes regulated by these promoters can be normally expressed. However, in cancer cells CGIs are hypermethylated at specific loci, which usually constitute the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Thus the expression of tumor suppressors is silenced which can lead to tumor development and progression. In tumors such CGI methylation patterns vary by tumor type and progress with time because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and accumulates with aging. Therefore hypermethylation of CGIs at promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes promotes tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in normal cells. This methylation maintains genomic stability by preventing processes like illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transposition, as well as activation of cryptic promoters within repeats and intergenic regions. However, in cancer cells an overall hypomethylation pattern of repetitive elements and intergenic regions is observed. This hypomethylation promotes genomic instability because the above-mentioned processes are no longer blocked. Genomic instability can then enhance tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is characteristic for cancer and can be caused by both DNA hypermethylation and DNA hypomethylation. One example for loss of imprinting due to DNA hypermethylation is the hypermethylation of the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster that leads to Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>The ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is located downstream of Igf2 and upstream of H19. In normal cells the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter. Therefore the enhancers located downstream of H19 cannot promote its expression but promote the expression of Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.  The ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated in normal cells. Therefore it binds the CTCF protein that insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Thus Igf2 is normally not expressed by the maternal allele. A loss of imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster is observed in Wilm’s tumor. The maternal allele becomes hypermethylated and expresses Igf2. Therefore loss of imprinting leads to expression of Igf2 from both alleles and thus a double dose of Idf2. Igf2 is growth-promoting and therefore it contributes to tumorigenesis during Wilm’s tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine may be used to treat cancer because of its DNA demethylation effects that change the epigenetic expression patterns associated with cancer. Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated in DNA during replication and binds irreversibly DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). In this way Decitabine causes DNA demethylation. Decitabine has a division-dependent action and is therefore suitable for targeting fast proliferating tumor cells. By promoting DNA demethylation Decitabine can relieve the hypermethylation of CGIs in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and thus have an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation might have effects on the organs that are still developing and maybe also on the DNA methylation patterns of the offspring. Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable and therefore alternations in DNA methylation in one cell will be transmitted to all the cells that will derive from it. Also, DNA methylation patterns of some genomic elements like repeats and imprinted genes are maintained throughout some of the epigenetic sensitive periods, which might mean that DNA methylation patterns might be transmitted from one generation to the next. Sensitive periods are the periods when changes in the environment can have effects on the epigenetic control. These are the periods of active epigenetic remodeling, of removal and relaying marks in the epigenome. In humans sensitive periods are the periods of primodial germ cell development and early embryonic preimplantation development. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods might be inadvisable because the drugs can alter the normal methylation pattern of healthy cells, leading to a disease, and because alternated DNA methylation might be inherited by the next generations.</p></div>
