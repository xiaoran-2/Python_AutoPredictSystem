    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands tends to be to silence the gene because of the fact that most CpG islands are found at the promoters of genes. Methylation may either prevent factor binding thus preventing transcription from ensuing or may lead to the formation of repressive chromatin structures. Either way, the function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. However, in normal cells CpG islands tend to be unmethylated due to the fact that if genes are in use they cannot be methylated and thus silenced. DNA methylation in cancer is disrupted at CpG islands. In cancer, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and thus prevent the transcriptional machinery from accessing the DNA. If important genes such as tumor suppressor genes are methylated and thus silenced when they should not be, then diseases (like cancer in this case) are more likely to ensue as a result of the disruption of methylation at CpG islands.</p>
<p>In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, while in cancer these regions tend to be unmethylated. At intergenic regions methylation is used to maintain genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites and splice sites which would otherwise cause errors in transcripts (or produce no transcript at all) which would be detrimental. Methylation at intergenic regions is also used to ensure genomic stability; otherwise deletions, duplications, insertions, reciprocal translocations, etc would lead to disease. At repetitive elements methylation is used to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats which would otherwise jump around the genome and transpose themselves into coding regions of genes which would lead to disease if methylation were disrupted. Methylation at repetitive elements may also prevent illegitimate recombination which otherwise would damage entire chromosomes and thus produce diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster contains a methylated ICR and a methylated H19 gene. This allows downstream enhancers to act solely on Igf2 thus allowing only the production of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR is methylated which allows CTCF to bind to it and insulate the Igf2 from downstream enhancers thus preventing production of Igf2, instead allowing the production of H19.</p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumor because of hypermethylation at the ICRs in this cluster. In Wilm’s tumor, both ICRs are hypermethylated and the CTCF-ICR binding that occurs normally in the maternal allele does not occur because the maternal ICR is methylated. Thus Igf2 is not protected from the downstream enhancers and methylation at the maternal ICR spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it. However, because this also occurs in the paternal genome there is a double dose of Igf2. Because Igf2 is a growth factor, a double dose of it can lead to Wilm’s tumor. Disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to imprinted disorders like Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome because cells have effectively two paternal-like alleles as there is a loss of the maternal-like allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue DNA methyltransferases inhibitor (DNMTi) used for myelodysplatic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine is used to inhibit the enzymatic epigenetic regulator DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) which normally lays down methylation. As a nucleoside analogue, Decitabine is used to irreversibly bind to DNMTs after it is incorporated into the DNA in order to prevent the methylation of DNA that would be inherited during cell division and is thus replication dependent. Because cancer cells replicate more than normal cells they would be the most affected by Decitabine especially since after every cell division, the hypermethylated CpG islands which are characteristic of cancer will no longer be inherited by daughter cells. This would thus result in an overall CpG island demethylation of daughter cells. As a result, Decitabine prevents the spread of tumors since the daughter cells of cancer cells no longer inherit hypermethylated CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable as DNA methylation is copied by DNMT1 onto new daughter strands of DNA. Thus any alteration to DNA methylation would endure for the lifetime of the progeny of cells that undergo DNA methylation alterations and their progeny.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when environmental factors can influence epigenetic control. Sensitive periods tend to be periods when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained.  Two examples of sensitive periods are primordial germ cell development and the early/post implantation phases of early development.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because environmental factors may be introduced which can alter whether epigenetic marks are established. Because environmental factors can alter the establishment of epigenetic marks and there are epigenetic mark that are mitotically heritable, one can conclude that treatments during sensitive periods may harmfully affect the way epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are inherited during cell division by possibly inducing hypomethylation/hypermethylation in the germ cells of the patients which can be inherited transgenerationally as seen during the Dutch Famine and the Overkalix cohort. This is also why one must have caution when treating younger patients because of the effects of treatments on germ cells.</p></div>
