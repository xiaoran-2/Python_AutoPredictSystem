    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation.</strong></span></p>
<p>DNA methylation can be found in all cells for epigenetic phenomena. Methylation almost exclusively occurs at cytosine guanine combinations, called CpG's. The methylgroup attaches to the cytosine under the control of the <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>DN</strong></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">A </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>m</strong></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">ethyl</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>t</strong></span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">ransferase</span></span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> enzymes </span></span>(eg DNMT3 and DNMT1). In promoters of genes you can find clusters of CpG's, CpG islands. In healthy cells CpG islands normally are unmethylated.</p>
<p>The largest part of the genome consists of intergenic regions and repetative elements. These regions and elements usually are methylated, to maintain genomic integrity. This can eg. be done by silencing cryptic (=accidental) promoters and preventing transpositions (=jump in DNA).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Disruptions in DNA methylation can cause disease.</strong></span></p>
<p>The mamalian body depends on an equilibrium between all the systems and processes. The right amount of the right proteins/enzymes/etc has to be made to be able to function normally.</p>
<p>When CpG islands are hypermethylated (=more methylated) the gene is silenced (=the coding in the gene is not read).</p>
<p>Hypomethylation (lack of methylation) of intergenic regions and repeats can cause cryptic promoters to be read, repeats can be activated, transpositions can occur or neighbouring genes can be disrupted.</p>
<p>In all these cases the generation of the right amount of the right proteins can be disrupted, and eventually cause a disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Disruptions in DNA methylation and cancer.</strong></span></p>
<p>The earliest epigenetic aberation in cancer found was a genome wide (intergenic regions and repetative elements) hypomethylation. As stated above this leads to all sorts of DNA disruptions, that eventually can cause cancer.</p>
<p>Methylation is mitotically heritable so all cancer (tumour) cells show the same methylation. If CpG island hypermethylation occurs in the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene, then that gene is silenced and the tumour will not be suppressed and therefor can grow uncontrolled.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of the Igf2 gene (encoding insulin-like growthfactor 2) and the H19 gene, in between these two there is an imprinting control region (ICR) and downstream of H19 are enhancers.</div>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>On the <strong>paternal</strong> allele the ICR is methylated, blocking CTCF and cofactors from binding to the ICR. The H19 promoter is also methylated and therefore H19 is inactivated. The enhancers can now acces the Igf2 gene which is active.</span></p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>On the <strong>maternal</strong> allele the ICR is unmethylated, so CTCF can bind to it. This blocks the enhancers to acces Igf2 and instead H19 is accessed. So on the maternal allele Igf2 is inactive and H19 is active.</span></p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><span>Loss of imprinting on the maternal allele can cause the activation of Igf2, this is common in Wilms tumor (a childhood solid tumor). Loss of imprinting causes the two alleles of Igf2 to be active and therefore there will be a double dose of Igf2 produced.</span></p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb"><a></a><span>Too little Igf2 (if both alleles are inactivated) results in less growth of the embryo and too much Igf2 results in extra growth of the embryo and/or organs this disease is called <span><span><span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome. </span></span></span><span><span>Children with this syndrome have a high risk on </span></span>tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (a precursor of acute myelogenous leukeamia). Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. DNMT stands for DNA methyltransferase and is a substance that plays an important role in the de novo methylation of DNA (DNMT3) and in the maintenance of methylation <span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">(</span>DNMT1). Decitabine is an inhibitor so it prevents methylation and the maintenance of it, therefore it is also called a demethylating agent or hypomethylating agent. <span lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">When given in a low dosage Decitabine lowers the level of methylation, a high dosis is toxic.</span></p>
<p>The antitumor effect of Decitabine comes with the demethylating of promoters of tumor suppression genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inherited. As long as there are no changes of some kind, mutation, medicines etc. the epigenetic marks are maintained as long as the organism lives. Some marks are, presumed, inheritable over generations of organisms.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">The complete layout of epigenetic marks is called the epigenome. The epigenome determines which genes or even X-chromosomes are turned on or off. If a mark is removed or added and that makes a gene being turned on or off then you have changed the epigenome. These changes are then again mitotically heritable.</p>
<p lang="en-gb" xml:lang="en-gb">Epigenetic marks are needed to let the organism function in a healthy manner. It is therefore crucial that the epigenetic marks are laid down as they should be. This happens in the so called sensitive periods. The first period is during embryogenesis, when gametes grow to become epiblasts. During this period the de novo methylation takes place. The second sensitive period is during gametogenesis, when gametes are formed. During this period the epigenetic marks are erased. Interfering with medicine in the methylation/demethylation in these periods results in incorrect methylation and can be the reason for an inviable embryo or defects/diseases in the growing embryo. </p>
