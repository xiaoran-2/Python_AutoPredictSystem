    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>normally at the promoters of CpG islands there is less DNA methylation. its normal function is to maintain genomic stability.In cancer cells,DNA hypermethylation occurs in the tumour suppresor genes thereby silencing their expression. in cancer there is a reversal of DNA methylation i.e.intergenic regions,repetative elements get hypomethylated while CpG islands and their shores get hypermethylated which is the complete opposite of a normal healthy cell. intergenic regions and repetative elements are methylated in normal cells. when the intergenic regions and repetative elemnts get hypomethylated in cancer ,they become active and jump around the genome ,make copies and behave as transposons,leading to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>normally in H19/igf2 cluster,there is monoallelic parent of origin expression i.e.ICR on paternal allele is methylated,CTCF binds on the ICR on maternal allele and the enhancer is free to bind to H19 and igf2 is silent in maternal allele (no expression).but on paternal allele the ICR is methylated hence no CTCF binds to ICR to insulate it and thus enhancer acts on igf2 and expresses it. in cancer , there is hypermethylation of ICR in both alleles i.e. no insulation on ICR by CTCF thus enhancers act on igf2 activating it hence excess expression of igf2 which is growth promoting leading to wilms tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.when decitabine is taken ,it binds to the dna during replication and this binding is irreversible. and its division dependant thus the tumour cells which replicate a lot more will get adversely affected and get reduced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>dna methylation is present throughout our epigenome.any drug which alters the methyaltion has the potential to change drastically so many things in our bodies. sensitive periods are in the foetus, embryogenesis, spermatogenesis . treating patients during sensitive periods is unadvisable as that is time they will be laying out epigenetic marks which will be unalterable and mitotically heritable.</p></div>
