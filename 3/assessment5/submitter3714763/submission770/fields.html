    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation in cancer cells and their effects</li>
</ul><p>CpG island methylations are depended on cancer types and subtypes. Some cancers hypermethylate CpG island and others hypomethylate them. Hypermethylation of CpG islands suppress expressions of cancer/tumors suppressor genes. Then cancer/tumors cells continue to grow. Hypomethylation of CpG islands leads overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<ul><li> Intergenic region and repetitive elements</li>
</ul><p>Intergenic region and repetitive element are normally methylated in order to DNA stabilization. <br /> In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also hypomethylated. <br /> Hypomethylation of both of them makes genome unstable. Those instabilities make unnecessary cell disorders, such as activation of cryptic promoters.  </p>
<ul><li> Summary</li>
</ul><p>Different methylations from normal cell are observed in cancer cells. Aberrations are occurred in DNA methylation and histones. These changes are genetically and epigenetically progressed. These changes   activate oncogenes and inactivate cancer suppressor genes. Thus cancer cells grow</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p>
<p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Maternal ICR is usually not methylated. CTCF can bind ICR and downstream enhancer can express H19 promoter and suppress Igf2. On the other hand, Paternal ICR is methylated. CTCF can not bind ICR and make silence H19 promoter then enhancer activate Igf2. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In case of Willm’s tumor cell. both maternal and paternal ICR are methylated. So, both genes activate Igf2. <span> </span>Then Igf2 is overexpressed. Igf2 overexpress helps growth of the cancer cells because Igf2 is growing factor.<span>   </span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, so-called Dacogen, is DNA-demethylating agents..</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase in the form of azacitidine.</p>
<p>Decitabine induces hypomethylation in neoplastic cells.  Once Decitabine makes methylation changes (to inhibit hyper methylation) to the tumor cells and restore normal function, the effect continues until tumor cells are erased.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin told that epigenetic changes are passed to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are actually erased and epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. In other word, once epigenetic drug makes methylation changes (to inhibit hyper methylation) to the tumor cells, the effect continues until tumor cells are erased.</p>
<p>Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods during development. One is early development and other is PGC( Primordial Germ Cell) development. Epigenetic reprograming is in progress in both. Once methylation is erased then re-build up again. Especially during methylation is building up, anti-methylation drug has effects to inhibit methylation and makes unpredictable changes or mutations of epigenomes and genes including imprinting.</p>
<p>So, epigenetic drug should not be used for pregnancy patients whose babies are in sensitive periods.</p></div>
