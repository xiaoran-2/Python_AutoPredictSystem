    <div class="field-value"><p>- DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to increase a locus specific expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>-  DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in earlier development or during specific period depending on the tissue (period where epigenome can change according to the environment messages). Epigenetic alteration occurs a lot because of point mutations, chromatin remodellers in exemple if TET proteins that are involved in DNA demethylation are mutated by cancer (and become inefficient), there will be an DNA hypermethylation.</p>
<p>- In cancer, there is a DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands, at specific locii, and they differ by tumour type.</p>
<p>- A DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands silences the tumour suppressor genes (inhibit the expression), so there is less control of tumour. Futhermore, hypermethylation at CpG islands lead, with a swap, to hypomethylation gene and, in most of the cases, repetitive elements. It's one part of the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>- There is a phenomenon like a swap, or a reprocical cross where DNA is methylated. When CpG islands  and CpG islands shores are hypermethylated, then the intronic regions and intergenic regions, and repetitive elements upstream are hypomethylated. So the DNA methylation in these regions is disrupted in cancer.</p>
<p>- When intergenic regions and repetitive elements of tumour supressor genes are hypomethylated, it conducts to a fail for protecting cells from tumour, and it contributes to disease : repeats or intergenic regions that are hypomethylated lead to genomic instability, so the risk of mutation increases and the risk of tumour too.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Indeed, it can be mitotically transmitted to the daughter cells. Altered epigenome can alter the normal expression / silencing of genes in the cells, causing different diseases. </li>
<li>A sensitive period is a period in which epigenetic changes are possible : the epigenome can be changed by different environmental agents, like drugs. Then, these epigenetic changes are inheritable for dauther cells and stay present for the whole life, and sometimes can be transmitted to the descendants.</li>
<li>The sensitive periods of development are during embryogenesis and gaetogenesis. There are other sensitive periods during adult life, at different moment for different tissue (it's tissue specific).</li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because there is a higher risk for these drugs, which alter DNA methylation and so alter epigenetic mechanism, to alter the DNA methylation of healthy cells of the patient or of the children of the patient if it alter the gametes or the embryo. </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, more speficially an DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. </p>
<p>- Decitabine decreases DNA methylation by inhibiting the DNA methytransferase (an epigenetic regulator). It's an nucleoside analogue that binds irreversibly DNMTs after it's incorporated into DNA, so it's replication dependent. It's interesting because tumour cells replicates a lot, but it's not selective.</p>
<p>- Epimutations are reversible, so if we reverse the epimutations, maybe we can treat the patients and increase the patient survival.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- The methylation of the paternal allelle of H19 leads to have no expression of H19 and there is no CTCF bound to the ICR, so the enhancers can activate the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>-The absence of methylation of the maternal alle of H10 leads to have a CTCF bound to the ICR and an expression of H19. Igf 2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>- When there is an hypermethylation of the ICR, so in the paternal and maternal alleles, we have two copies of Igf2 that are expressed instead of one copy. It occurs really early in the development, in the preneoplastic tissues.This hypermethylation can be caused by mutations (especially point mutation) in all types of epigenetic regulators, like chromatin remodellers.</p>
<p>- Igf2 is a gene that promotes growth, so it's an oncogene because tumour are cells that grow too much comparing to normal cells. So hypermethylation of ICR contributes to disease.</p></div>
