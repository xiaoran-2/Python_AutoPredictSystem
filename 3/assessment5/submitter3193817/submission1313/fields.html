    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA is hypomethylated at CpG islands and methylated around repetitive elements. In cancer, methylation occurs at CpG islands and normally methylated areas are hypomethylated. With CpG silenced this way, tumor supressing genes are silenced. Wtih intergenetic regions hypomethylated, repetitive elements are expressed which can recombine in mutagenic ways and also lead to uncontrolled growth and cancer. From lectures.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi or a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It helps to prevent methylation from occuring in a daugther strand of DNA when a cell divides. This helps CpG islands to stay active which keeps anti tumor genes active and also prevents repetitive blocks from being expressed, helping to keep growth under control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylated in paternal allele. Unmethylated in maternal allele Imprint therefore on paternal chromosome. H19 just from maternal allele. H19 is a resevoir for a type of microRNA CTFC binds and short loops enhancers to promote H19. If ICR is methylated, CTFC can't bind and enhancers don't promote H19, but loop to lgf2 instead, overpromoting it. igf2 promotes growth-it's an ocogene. Also cdkn1c which is a tumor suppressor is not produced. This happens when maternal allele acts like paternal allele-sometimes there are two copies of paternal allele.. From lectures.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is heritable, it can pass between generations. Sensitive periods are embryogenesis/gametogenensis and periods of slow growth but hormonal changes that occur at <br />9-12 years old in males and 8-10 years old plus fetal/infant for girls. Treating patients at these stages is not avisable because if can change the epigenetics of their germ cells and therefore their children.</p></div>
