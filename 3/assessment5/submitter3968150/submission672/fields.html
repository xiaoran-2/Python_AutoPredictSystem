    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a kind of DNA-demethylating agent. It can demethylate the genes which have been methylated before. Since the cancer cells may have a lot of abnormal hypermethylation on it CpG islands, the Decitabine may help to demethylate these abnormal hypermethylated CpG islands. And therefore may have some anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    The reason why DNA methylation has effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment is that it is a mitotic heritable process which can be maintained by enzymes like Dnmt 1. After cell division, the two daughter cells have some hemimethylated DNA. The Dnmt 1 can recognize these hemimethylated DNA substrates and then methylate the unmethylated strand of the hemimethylated DNAs. Therefore some drugs’ DNA methylation effects can last until the methylation is activated removed.</p>
<p>    Since these drugs’ fundamental mechanism for treatment disease is DNA methylation, the DNA methylation reprogramming stage may be the sensitive period of these drugs. The sensitive period is a period when the drugs’ effects on DNA methylation may influence the next generation development. It includes the period from primordial germ cell development to mature gamete and the period of pre-implantation. If a pregnant woman take these drugs which can alter the DNA methylation process in her body, it can also influence the fetus’ DNA methylation reprogramming process during the pre-implantation process. It may cause some abnormality in the fetus. And what more, if the fetus is a female, these drugs may even influence the grandchild because the oogenesis occurs during the female is still in fetus stage.</p></div>
