    <h1>Submission 1423 from Anon (session_user_id: 2073659b5b9b7d2ff937d317c02c3e22428bd67b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genome wide hypomethylation occurs in all tumors. In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with global hypomethylation of repeat-rich intergenic regions and hypermethylation of CpG-dinucleotides in gene-associated regions. Hypomethylation leads to genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats which can then transpose to other regions of the genome, and activation of promoters and neighboring genes. Hypermethylation of CpG-dinucleotide rich islands (CGIs) throughout the genome leads to the inactivation of promoters and the subsequent inactivation of downstream tumor-suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, specifically a hypomethylation agent which works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for methylating cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. This therefore causes the genome to become hypomethylated at CGIs and allows promoters to become accessible for downstream tumor-suppressor gene expression which can then signal and kill tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of the imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster on chromosome 11p15.5 can lead to downstream gene expression alterations and eventually disease.</p>
<p>In normal, non-cancerous tissues, methylation of the H19 gene on the paternal allele leads to repression of its gene expression thereby allowing downstream enhancers to interact with and activate the upstream Igf2 gene. In contrast, unmethylation of the H19 gene on the maternal allele promotes binding of the upstream CTCF insulator thereby redirecting the enhancer to increase expression of the H19 gene and therefore silencing the Igf2 gene from the maternal chromosome.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is a loss of the maternal allele and a duplication of the paternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster. This mutation, in short, results in an over-expression of the Igf2 gene and no expression of the H19 gene.</p>
<p>The H19 gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene and Igf2 is a candidate oncogene, so in this case of uniparental disomy of the H19/Igf2 cluster you have a relative overexpression of a cancer causing gene (Igf2) and no expression of the anti-cancer gene (H19). This will therefore contribute to the development of disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG-dinucleotides is to repress the expression of the downstream protein-coding gene or the downstream non-coding RNA. There are regions of the genome that have a relatively high abundance of these CpG-dinucleotides and are therefore call CpG islands or CGI. These CGI in contrast to CpG-dinucleotides are normally unmethylated on their cytosine nucleotides and allow expression of the downstream protein-coding gene or the downstream non-coding RNA.</p>
<p>In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with global hypermethylation of CGI in gene-associated regions. This leads to a decrease in the gene expression of the downstream genes and can lead to other diseases as well. Hypermethylation of CGI throughout the genome leads to the inactivation of promoters and the subsequent inactivation of downstream tumor-suppressor genes, which have the primary function of fighting cancer causing mutations and killing cancerous cells.</p>
<p>In contrast to the gene rich regions where CGI are located, there are intergenic regions of the genome, which are categorized as being very sparse in their gene distributions. The normal function of DNA methylation in these intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to be hypermethylated. This, in a sense, silences these regions in normal tissues.</p>
<p>In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with global hypomethylation of CpG-dinucleotides in repeat-rich intergenic regions. Hypomethylation leads to genomic instability by allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats which can then transpose to other regions of the genome, and activation of promoters and neighboring genes, that are not normally expressed in certain tissues or at specific developmental timeframes. This therefore can directly lead to the progression of diseases.</p></div>
