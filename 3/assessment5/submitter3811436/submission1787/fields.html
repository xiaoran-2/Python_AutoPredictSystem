    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypomethylated. Methylation of CpG islands on a gene promotor leads to silencing of that gene. In case of  oncogenesis,  the CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated.The hypermethylation that occurs, silence the tumor supressor genes thus allowing the cell to grow more, divide more often and live longer than normal cells. Also, hypermethylation is mytotically heritable allowing the progeny to also be "superior" to normal cells.</p>
<p>      By contrast, during oncogenesis the genome-wide methylation drops. This happens in some cases in CpG poor geene promoters, but it happens in every known tumor type in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, intergenic regions and repeptitive elements are hypermethylated.  Methylation of these parts of the genome assures genomic stability.  Because once they are demethylated, they are activated and can lead to disruption of neigbouring genes,  make copies of themselves and transpose on different locations in the genome, and also can cause illegal recombinations between repeats.  This results in an abnormal kariotype that can include deletion, insertion and translocation of parts of chromosomes and changes the function and responses of a cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting is another example of the role of methylation in oncogensis. Normally, H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted, meaning that  ICR on the patternal allele is methylated, which inhibits the binding of the CTCF insulator and inhibits the activation of H19. But the downstream enhancers are allowed to activate the Igf2 gene, which is normaly expressed only on the paternal allele. The maternal allele ICR is not methyated allowing the binding of CTCF. This protein inhibits the enhancers to activate Igf2, but instead activate H19. So in a normall cell the petrnall allele expresses igf2, and the maternall H19.</p>
<p>However in case of Wilm's tumor what happens is loss of imprinting, through methylation of both maternal and paternal ICRs, leading to binding of CTCF to both ICRs and activation of Igf2, and silencing of H19 on both alleles. So the cell gets a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth factor, leading  to a disbalance in signals for growth and restriction of growth, further leading to tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a an DNA-methyl transferase inhibitor, that is currently one of four epigenetic inhibitors approved by the FDA for treating of different cancer types - mostly leukemyas and lymphomas. Decitabine is used for treatmnet of MDS that has progressed to AML. This drug is a nucleoside analogue, which means that it is incorporated in the replicating chain of DNA, so it is active only in dividing cells. After it is part of the strand, when DNMT comes to methylate it, the drug binds the enzyme ireversibly. It's exact mechanism of action is unknown and it is not selective to cancer cells. It is supposed to act through demethylation of CpG islands of tumor supressors, and hemathological malignancies might be dependant on those. It is currently being tested on a nuber of soid tumors as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If a patient is given a drug like decitabine (DNMTi) it will cause demthylation of the CpG islands of dividing cells. Since methylation is mytoticaly heritable, the progeny of the treated cells will express the same pattern of demethylation, even if the drug is discontinued. Unfortunatelly, the drug is not selective, and causes demethylation in other parts of the genome as well. </p>
<p>The reserchers and the clinicians are not yet sure what this genome wide demethylation can cause in a long run. The drug is for the moment given to elderly patients with MDS progressed AML, who react to it well, and tolerate it well too, and for whom long term epigenetic alterations are not a real concern.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic marks are reset at two points during a human life span - embriogenesis, and gametogenesis. At those sensitive periods of development the cells go through a complete epigenetic remake, and are extremelly vulnerable to epigenetic drugs. It would not be safe to use epigenetic modifiers that are available at the moment, because they are not yet selective enough, and there is no way to predict what would happen in the long run if they are used during pregnancy or childhood.  </p></div>
