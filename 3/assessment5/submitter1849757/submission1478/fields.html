    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is, simply put, the addition of a methyl- group (-CH3) to DNA, commonly at a cytosine or adenine locus, where it can bring about activation or silencing of other genes throughout the genome. Normal DNA function at GpC islands is regulated by the addition of and or removal of acetylases and methyltransferases.   </p>
<p>DNA hyper-methylation at GpC islands in Cancer are locus specific, can silence tumor suppressor genes, and cause loss of imprinting at ICRs. Hypo-methylation in Cancer can lead to errors in RNA transcription,  translation, transposon translocation, and coding errors, which result in the addition or removal of enzymes that effect the ability of the gene to perform in a normally correct manner, X-inactivation inhibition,  insertion or deletion of transposons,  and environmental mutagenesis.  In particular, abherrance in Cancer includes any process that leads to genomic instability and proliferation/ hyperplasia of abnormal cells, but does not change the overall genotype.</p>
<p>Normal DNA is  heavily hyper-methylated at GpC islands, which forms a heterochromatin structure, so  access to DNA is limited. Cancer is hypomethylated at the GpC islands resulting in an open chromosome structure that can be easily altered.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic and repetitive regions is to maintain genomic stability. If the repeats and intergenic regions are hypo-methylated, genomic instability occurs. Hypo-methylation seems to occur early in tumoragenesis and progress with time, as does CpG island hyper-methylation.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease  because growth of abherrent cells occurs unchecked and unregulated leading to instability and identity dependent recombination. Activation of one gene may, in turn, activate another, creating unchecked mutagenesis, and therefore, Cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is currently being used to treat MDS, the precurser to AML and belongs to a class of epigenetic, DNA de-methylating agents, that influence activation of tumor-suppressor cells, some of which include those employed in developing solid tumors, such as those seen in Lung Cancer. </p>
<p>Thus far; Decitibine has been shown to, not only bring about demethylation in parent cells, but is also . mitotically heritable to daughter and granddaughter cells, until actively erased. When used in combination with histone-deacetylase inhibitors, a synergistic effect has been noted, wherein tumoragenesis is inhibited and the following routine chemotherapy is better tolerated.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor effect is carried through mitotically by daughter and granddaughter cells that also carry the epigenetic marker that will cause the re-activation of tumor-suppressor cells and slow or inhibit the hyperplasia seen in Cancer, without damage to healthy neighboring cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Overall manipulation of the epigenetic genome should not take place during periods of "sensitivity". These periods include implantation and  gamatogenisis, up to day 8.5 or 9.0, so that methylation markers can be laid down correctly, early gestation in the pregnant mother through the end of the 1st trimester, when rapid development of the fetus and neural-tube formation occurs. Other time periods include the "sensitive" years in boys: ages 9-12 and girls: 8-10, as noted in the Overkalix Study. These effects were indicative of both paternal grandmothers' passage of shorter longevity to granddaughters, and paternal grandfathers' passage of chronic disease to the grandsons. Treatment during any of the "sensitive" periods would cause loss of methylation markers at IGRs, CpG islands, intergenic transposons, and repeats, due to loss of inhibition marks and gains of activation marks. Drugs that alter DNA methylation could lead to death or teratogenesis.</p>
<p>Altering DNA methylation imprinting markers can cause dysregulation of epigenomic influences on RNA transcription, translation, X-chromosome inactivation, loss of hypermethylation at CpG islands and shores, and transposon jumps in the chromosomes, which tend to occur within megabase pairings in the DNA genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Parental  imprinting and gametic imprinting all are concerned with parental monoallelic expression, where the extra X chromosome is silenced.  X- inactivation is random so that one X chromosome is silenced rather than passed on, as might happen with X-Trisomy in  females and XXY Klienfelter's males.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and bound by CTCF, which restricts access to Igf2. </p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind to it, therefore increasing methylation and expression of Igf2 through the Igf2/H19 cluster.  Igf2 methylation spreads to the H19 promoter gene, which is then silenced. This only happens with the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor, the Igf2/H19 cluster is disrupted by chromosomal deletion of WT1, the Wilm's Tumor suppressor gene, deletion of chromosome 16 and duplication of chromosome 12, which lack silencing of the extra X chromosome. As Igf2 is not silenced, it is over expressed resulting in hyperplasia of renal cells, which result in tumoragenesis, seen primarily in girls less than 5 years old. Wilm's Tumor is considered to be embryonal in nature, so anything that effects methylation markers in primordial development would cause this cancer.</p></div>
