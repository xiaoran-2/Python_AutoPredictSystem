    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:medium;">- DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that occurs predominately at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. A 5- methyl group is added  to the  fifth carbon of the cytosine. It's associated with gene silencing if it's found at the promoters. It helps to maintain genomic stability in several different ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;">- The cpg islands are more likely methylated in cancer cells than in normal cells . In general this cpg island are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">- CpG island methylation progresses with time. As the cancer progresses we get increased methylation of CpG islands that are associated with tumour suppressors. As people age you get this same sort of change in DNA methylation within the genome. And this is really raised the ideas that maybe cancer is just a consequence of aging, maybe we're all in a kind of slightly pre neoplastic state as we age. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">-  </span>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. It's clearly not really silencing the expression of a normal gene.  Cells that don't contain DNA methyltransferase-1 exhibit genomic instability. When there's genomic instability, you can have many things occurring. For example deletions, insertions, duplications of whole chromosomes as well as translocations between chromosomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in other parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.  </span></p>
<pre class="hg-tinymce-code"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">-   Some types of cancers are driven by chromosomal instability, and in this case if you deplete DNA methylation, you will have exacerbating the genome-wide hypermethylation which contributes to genomic instability. And therefore it will enhance tumorigenesis. So the role of DNA methylation is being context dependent.  </span></span></pre></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:medium;">- The imprinted control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele, and this means it's paternally imprinted.  The ICR bound CTCF. Igf2 is insulated (inactive) and H19 is expressed in the maternl allele. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;">- On the patternal allele the imprint control region is methlyated so, CTCF can no longer bind. And Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;">- W<span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">ith loss of imprinting you have high hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now you have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to what you saw in a normal cell. And Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">- Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types. And in fact, occurs as a very early event, so it's often seen in preneoplastic tissues. So, before you would actually decide that it really was a frank tumor. And so this suggests that maybe these events at the imprint control regions, these hypermethylation, or hypomethylation events. Might be very early events in tumor regenesis. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- Decitabine </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>(5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine)</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"> is a DNA-demethylating inhibitor agent. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- Decitabine </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. That stpo the cell division. And this means that the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">- Cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most </span></span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more. </span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="justify"><span style="color:#004586;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- </span></span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. That is quite possible. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- Periods where the DNA methylation needs to be removed.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- Early development and primordial germ cell development.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">- It would be a very large insult to the enviroment to take a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery in</span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"> sensitive period. So these sorts of things still need to be considered,</span></span></span></p></div>
