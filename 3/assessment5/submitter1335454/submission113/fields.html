    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA  methylation is one of the important epigenetic marks in the field of epigenetic control. DNA methylation's normal function is to silence or inactivate gene expressions and they normally are present at the promoters in 70-80% in somatic cells . DNA methylation is the basics in the epigenetic field such as x- chromosome in activation , imprinting and formation of heterochromatin . in contrast DNA methylation at cpg island which are present in 60% at promotors , tends to be kept free of methylation ( hypomethylated ) independant of their activity state . DNA methylation of cpg islands is disrupted in cancer where cpg islands at the promotors are hypermethylated which lead to silence the expression of underlying gene. These DNA methylation at cpg islands contribute to cancer by inactivationg tumor supperssor genes and this is often more frequent .so these hypermethylation at these specific loci are called epimutations and their identity varies by tumor type . Also hypomethylation genome wide contribute to cancer in CPG poor promoters leading to activating oncogenes. on the other hand DNA mehtylation is also present in intergenic and repetitive elements where their main function is to mantian genomic stability and they are nomally mehtylated . In cancer , DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tends to be hypomethylated and leads to genomic instability . It mainly contributes to genomic instability where recombination between repeats  such as reciprocal translocations , activation of repeats and transposition and also activation of cryptic promotors . All this can lead to activation of oncogenes and enhance tumorgenesis .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypomethylation and hypermethylation can also affect imprinted genes which can contribute to cancer when disrupted . An example for that is the H19/Igf2 cluster where in the normal paternal allele , the imprint control region is hypermethylated and this methylation spreads to the promoter of the H19 gene so the CTCF wont bind to the methylated (ICR) causing the enhancers to act on the Igf2 and activating it and expressing it while silencing the H19 gene . In the maternal allele the (ICR) is hypomethylated so the CTCF insulator bind to unmethylated (ICR) causing enhancers to act on H19 activating it and silencing the expression of Igf2 . In wilm's tumor both the maternal and paternal allele is hypermethylated leading to the overexpression of Igf2 gene in both alleles disrupting monoallelic expression. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can result in loss of Growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promotng genes which is seen in pre-neoplastic tissue .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which is derived from the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) , which means that it lays demethylation of DNA,, they irreversinly bind with DNMT's after they are incorporated into DNA , thus it needs replication ( replication dependant ). they are described as having anti-tumour effect becasue as we all know in tumergenesis its all about dividing uncontrollably so these DNMTi such as Decitabine have an anti-neoplastic effect but must be in a low dose becasue higher doses are toxic . Decatabine is a drug used for treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the  period of drug treatment that make it more susceptible to chemotherapy .this is becasue reducing DNA methylation whether it is DNMTi Drugs or HDACi drugs slow tumor growth becasue it can decrease the formation and compaction of heterochromatin making it more accessible to enzymes and also activating tumor suppressor genes . But there are some sensitive period s where we must avoid treating patents with such Drugs . These sensitive periods are periods where it undergoes epigenetic reprogramming and epigenetic marks can be removed or added through out development . these sensitive periods contain : Early devolopment , pre- and post implantation and also primordial germ cell devolopment and germ cell production in gametogenesis .It is inadvisable to treat patients with the drugs in these periods due to the clearing , erasure and resetting of epigenetic marks which can affect the efficiency of the drug and producing side-effects .</p></div>
