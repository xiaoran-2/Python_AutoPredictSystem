    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of genes usually acts suppressing gene expression, when in promoter regions of the gene, or it can confers genome stability, when happen in intergenic regions and repeated elements, i.e. to avoid cromossomal translocation, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. In normal cells, the CpG islands (CGIs) are usually hipomethylated and the intergenic regions, repeated elements, the introns of genes are methylated. Although, in cancer cell, there is an hypermethylation of the CpG islands and demethylation of the intergenic regions, repeated elements and genes introns. This methylation can occur in CGIs of sets of tumor suppressor genes to be effective and these genes varies by cancer type. In cancer cells, this can silence a tumor suppression gene, but the methylation must be in both alleles, losing the imprinting signature of the gene in case of imprinted genes. The hypermethylation can occur not only in the promoter region, but also in regions around 2 kb upstream and downstream of the gene, known as island shores. By the other side, hypomethylation in the repeated elements or intergenic regions allow chromosome recombination, transposon expression and oncogenes can be activated. Both, increasing CGIs methylation and genome-wide hypomethylation, progress with time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth and modifications on them can lead to occurrence of cancer. The H19/Igf2 is an example of imprinted gene locus. Under normal circumstances, the imprinted control region of the paternal allele of this gene is methylated and unmethylated in the maternal allele. In the maternal allele, the CTCF can bind the unmethylated insulator element, the enhancers will be activated, acting on H19, the Igf2 gene will be silent. On paternal allele, the enhancers will act on the Igf2 and it will be expressed. In cancer, the H19/Igf2 gene locus lost its imprinting. There is an hypermethylation of the imprint control region in both alleles and the Igf2 will be expressed from both, increasing the amount of Igf2, a growth promoting. The increasing expression on Igf2 is associated with Wilm’s tumor, a childhood kidney tumor. This alteration can happen earlier, even before the tumor development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitor drug. This is approved by the Food Drug and Administration (FDA) to use in myelodysplasic syndrome that progress to acute myelod leukemia. It is a nucleoside analog that get incorporated into the DNA upon replication. The cancer cells have higher replication ratios, though being more affect by the drug. When the DNMT comes to bind the DNA to copy the methylation to the daughter strain, they became irreversible binded. In high doses, it is toxic, causing important side effects with low effect against cancer. In lower doses, it has a good anti-neoplastic effect, but its long term consequences are not fully understood. Once the drug acts in dividing cells and it is not selective, a disruptive effect could be caused in the normal cells. Other mechanisms in the cell could also be affected by this drug, which are not yet known.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If the epigenetic markers, as DNA methylation, suffers modifications in sensitive period of development, this alterations can lasts in life. These sensitive periods are the periods in life when the epigenetics markers are being erased, laid down and replaced. There are two major time points: the first, during the germ cells development until the maturation of eggs and sperm; the second, during pre- and early implantation of the zygote. Tissue specific effects during time points of organs development could also cause dysregulations. Treating patients during sensitive periods like pregnant women and young individuals that haven't gone trough the maturation of germs cells yet, is not advisable because further modifications could be caused in the germ cells or even in the zygote or fethus. Once patients in these sensitive periods were treated with epigenetic drugs it could have effects in their future sons, like carcinogenic effects due to oncogene/tumor suppressor genes expression or suppression; congenital abnormalities, because of abnormal fethus development or maybe generated individuals primed to diseases, as cancer; organ failure; even generating cromossomal abnormalities as duplications, translocations or deletions of regions. Actually, it could cause infertility depend of the type of changes in the germ cells’ genes.</p></div>
