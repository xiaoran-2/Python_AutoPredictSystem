    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     In paternal allele, the insulator element is methylated and this state avoids CTCF binding. With the path free, without steric hindrance cased by CTCF, enhancers can reach and interact with Igf2 promoter, leadind to the expression of the hormone.  Otherwise, in the maternal allele, the insulator element isn’t methylated, what guarantee the access of CTCF that blocks enhancers and leads to the H19 expression.</p>
<p>     In Wilm’s tumour cells, the maternal allele insulator is methylated as the paternal allele insulator (loss of imprint - LOI). The cellular growth and proliferation is probably due an extra dose of the hormone Igf2 and the absence of H19 (probably involved in trans regulation of several genes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a promising antitumoral drug that belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine is an analog of cytidine, able to inhibit methyltransferases and then after the cell division, daghter cells containing hemimethylated DNA are unable to methylate the new DNA strand in the prsence of this drug.</p>
<p>Considering that many CpG islands are found methylated in the promoter region of  suppresor genes in some tumors and that there are some imprinting loss by methylation related to some types of tumor, the Decitabine administration is an effective way of demethylating next generations  of tumoral cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics alterations are inheritable, so any epigenetic modification before cell division probably will be found in the daughter cells and consequentily the effect can last long after the drug administration.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are critical moments when a population of cells are undergoing na erasure of epigenetic marks and the reprogramming.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development. The first is the early development or preimplantation period when there is an overall clearance of epigenetic marks (except imprinted genes), starting in the gametes union and followed by reseting of the marks. The second period is the primordial germ cells development  when these undergo a reset of epigenetic marks, including imprinted genes, giving rise to the gametes.</p>
<p>During these periods of intense reseting drugs as DNA-demethylating agents or histone-deacetylase inhibitors can interfere in the correct marking for silencing or activation of importante genes involved in the cell cycle, programmed cell death, DNA repair and so on.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>   Generally CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells. On the other hand, in tumor cells these CpG islands are methylated.</p>
<p>   Many promoters have in their composition CpG islands and when these become methylated, the gene expression can be silenced because methyl groups can prevent the binding of transcription factors or recruit methyl binding proteins that besides preventing transcriptional factors, can interact with histone deacetylases, modifying the chromatin state. When this kind of epigenetic modification inappropiatedly happens in promoters related to tumor suppresors or genes that control programmed cell death, a tumor can arise.</p>
<p>   Introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually are hypermethylated in the normal cells and this level of methylation ensure the silence. Unlike, in some types of tumors these regions are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>   Once unmethylated, these elements may become active contributing to the conversion of the surounding heterochromain to euchromatin and to genome instability due transposition, illegitimate recombination and normal gene interference from transposon strong promoters.</p></div>
