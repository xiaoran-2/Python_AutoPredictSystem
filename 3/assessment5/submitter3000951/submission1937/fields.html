    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The DNA methylation is the additions of methyl groups a some bases C and G in the DNA  sequence, that are in the CpG island. This methylation is a epigenetic marker,  that control the expression or silence of genes.Normally when the DNA sequence is methyl, these are condensed for the different charges that have the DNA(-) and the methyl group (+), the attraction of the charges performed the condensation so the result is the silence of the genes because in these regions is  impossible read the sequence. A good example of these is the MECP2 a protein that is union between CH3 and de CpG2 that produced  the silence of genes , normally the function of the MECP2 is in the neuronal cells, and a simple modified of these produce Rett syndrome that is a neuronal disease .And other simples modifications in the methylation  like this produce phenotypic changes in the individual  and Cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. </span>This substance will inhibit the activity of an enzyme called EZH2. This enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins, which are part of the chromosomal packaging.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span>That is possible because <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></span></li>
<li>A sensitive period is a developmental period in which occur the epigenetic marks. The most important sentive periods in development are in Pre-implantation period (early development) and in primordial germ cell development.</li>
<li>During sensitive periods people are susceptible to epigenetic changes. For that reason the treatment will be more efective during that periods.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The new researches in the H19 gen, show that is so important the activation and silenced of this gen, in the control  of  grow up of  the cells for these do not grow up fast and cause cancer. Normally this gen is expressed in the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome is silenced by methylation CpG and  the  ICF2 gene  is expressed, these gene  also is so important in the control of  grow up cell  . These  is the normal situation that produce that all cells grow up  normally. But when have a alterations in the silenced of gens and the H19 gene is silenced in the maternal chromosome and expressed the ICF2 gen also the paternal chromosome. These case produce that the cell grow up so fast and produce a Cancer. This example  that produce a methylation in the H19 promoter  cause Wilm’s tumour that is a kidney malignancy</span></p></div>
