    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Methylation is a very important epigenetic mark that is usually associated with gene silencing, since it is the basis for the formation of heterochromatin, methylation is found in CpG dinucleotides but not usually in the CpG islands that correspond to promoters. On the contrary in cancer cells CpG islands and their shores tend to be hypermethylated especially in <strong>tumour suppressor genes </strong>(those that controll the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair) which causes them to be<strong> silenced</strong>. On the other hand, domains that are usually methylated such intragenic regions like repetitive sequences (to avoid transcriptional noise, antisense transcription and alternative splicing)  are found to be hypomethylated in cancer cells, this hypomethylation in intragenic regions leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong> that can result in unwanted recombination, altered karyotypes with abnormalities such as deletions, translocation, insertions and polyploidy, transposition of the repeats and disruption of genes that are neighboring an alternative promoter that was activated (e.g. CpG poor promoters that can activate oncogenes).</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Another fact to take into account is that there also seem to be alteration of the DNA methylation in imprinting control regions, either hypomethylation or hypermethylation in these zones can cause the<strong> loss of imprinting</strong> which can result in overexpression of a gene such as Igf2 and this can result in the formation of a tumour.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">All of these together in addition to the fact that DNA methylation can work as a genetic mutation for example silencing tumour suppressor genes and the facts that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and that epimutations are rapidly selected suggest that the alterations in the methylation patterns of a cell are one of the principal reasons for developing cancer. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are those that are expressed either from the mother or from the father but not from both of them, the expression of these type of genes is controlled by an imprint control region (ICR), in the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster the insulin-like growth factor is silenced in the maternal allele and the H19 in the paternal allele, this imprinting event depends on the methylation state of the ICR of the cluster which is located downstream the Igf2 gene but upstream the H19 gene. On the paternal chromosome the ICR is methylated while on the maternal chromosome it is unmethylated allowing binding of CTCF and therefore allowing the expression of H19 and promoting the silencing of Igf2, while on the father the methylation of the ICR spreads downstream to the promoter of H19 making it silenced and allowing the expression of Igf2. In Wilm's tumour the ICR on the maternal chromosome is methylated just like on the paternal chromosome resulting in the overexpression of Igf2 and no expression of H19.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer; the loss of imprinting can lead to the overexpression of certain genes and the silencing of others, where these last ones could be tumour suppressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, it accomplishes its demethylating purpose by targeting the enzymes DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTi) that are epigenetic regulators, it acts as an inhibitor for the methylation since it is a cytosine nucleoside analog that does not allow further methylation once it is introduced to the DNA, as a result genes that were silenced like tumour suppressor genes can then be reactivated and expressed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Keeping in mind that epigenetic marks, in this case methylation, are mitotically heritable once you have get rid of the methylation that is silencing tumour suppressor genes by the use of decitabine, the daughter cells and their offspring won't have those genes silenced either therefore there won't be tumour development. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is one factor that influence the long lasting effects (beyond the period of treatment) of the drugs that alter DNA methylation, that is that epigenetic marks, such as methylation, are mitotically heritable so once you alter the methylation pattern of a cell the daughter cells of that cells will have the same methylation patterns and the same will happen for the daughters of those cells and so on. But it is important to take into account that there are sensitive periods for the cells where they are susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming, it means that all the epigenetic marks are erased and then re-established, during development there are 2 stages where this clearance of epigenetic marks happen, one is in the pre-implantation period during early development and the other is during primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>The event of genetic reprogramming is very important because is due to this that cells can restore their pluripotency. But it is important to keep in mind that cells that are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming are susceptible to external factors to affect the lay of the epigenetic marks so treating patients with drugs that alter the DNA methylation could have negative effects if the cells are in a sensitive period because it can affect the setting of the epigenome of the cells.</p>
