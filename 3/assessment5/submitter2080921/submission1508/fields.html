    <h1>Submission 1508 from Anon (session_user_id: be8681747021478bbb05739d7b794693e246257b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by increasing or decreasing the degree of methylation in any given region of DNA, therefore influencing the accessiblility of segments of DNA by proteins. If a gene or gene promoter, for example. becomes more methylated, it can lead to genomic instability and altered expression levels of those genes. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division until they are erased.</p>
<p>Reprogramming of DNA methylation is a sensitive period. Such periods include during gametogenesis and after fertilisation or following articial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as the epigenome is vulnerable to factors affecting methylation patterns and can cause genomic instability, deregulation of vital genes and undesirable silencing of tumour suppressor genes. This can lead to further tumour heterogeneity, which impairs therapeutic intervention and treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>It impacts DNA mehtylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, causing reduced DNA methylation. It can be incorporated into DNA strands and encourages anti-CML activity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of the Igf2-H19 cluster of genes, the imprint control region is methylated, repressing expression of H19 through methylation spreading. The distal enhancers are able to acess the paternal Igf2 promoter to promote its expression.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele of the Igf2-H19 cluster of genes, the imprint control region is unmethylate, allowing CTCF (an insulator protein) to bind to the region and block the distal enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter to promote its expression. Therefore, maternal Igf2 expression is repressed.</p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, there is a predisposition to childhood tumours, eg. Wilm's tumour. Can be caused by maternal allele acting like paternal allele due to mutation causing loss of imprinting, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption. Results in either loss of Cdkn1c - growth supressing, or Igf2 upregulation - growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands causing silencing of the region, reducing nearby gene expression.</p>
<p>Disruption of this causes increased/abnormal  gene expression</p></div>
