    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands functions to silence gene expression.  Methylated CpG in promoter regions can prevent the binding of transcriptional factors via stearic hindrance, preventing genes from being transcribed.  Methylated CpG are bound by binding proteins (meCP1 and meCP2) which can recruit other factors that alter chromatin structure and enhance chromatin condensation (condensed chromatin is less likely to be transcribed).  Hypermethylation of CpG islands is commonly found in tumors, and can occur at single loci, within sets of genes and/or in areas surrounding CpG islands (CpG island shores).  Hypermethylation may result in the ‘turning off’ of tumor suppressor genes or other cellular machinery that maintains normal cell growth and development.  Similarly, genetic diseases may result when hypermethylation of CpG island promotors result in genetic instability through increased risk of mutation and/or alteration of DNA repair functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA tend to be methylated to maintain genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites, silencing repeats to prevent transposition or transcriptional interference from strong promotors, or preventing illegitimate recombination.  Genome wide loss of methylation at intergenetic regions and/or repeats is an early hallmark of cancer, found to some degree in all tumor types tested to date.  Loss of methylation can result in deleterious recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats (resulting in a variety of transcriptional aberrations), or activation of cryptic promotors with resulting disruption of neighboring genes. Depending on the gene(s) affected, these alterations may result in carcinogenesis or development of disease.</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of the Igf2 gene, a methylated imprinted control region (ICR), H19 gene with a methylated promoter (methylation spread from methylated ICR to promoter) and several downstream enhancers.  These enhancers act on both Igf2 or H19, however the H19 promoter is methylated (therefore silenced), so the enhancers are only able to trigger expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele.  The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of Igf2, an unmethylated ICR, H19 gene, and downstream enhancers.  The unmethylated ICR is covered by an insulator protein (CTCF), which blocks the effect of the downstream enhancers on Igf2, therefore Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. The do trigger H19 expression.  Wilms tumor, a renal tumor, and is caused when the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster behaves like the paternal allele, i.e. ICR is methylated (therefore not protected by CTCF), so enhancers stimulate expression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal alleles, resulting in Igf2 overexpression.  Igf2 promotes growth and is an oncogene; individuals with this disorder have fetal and post-natal overgrowth and increased susceptibility to tumors during embryonic development and childhood (but not adulthood).</strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  Decitabine irreversibly binds and inhibits DNMTs, inhibiting methylation of DNA.  The overall effect is hypomethylation of DNA of rapidly dividing (e.g. cancer) cells, inhibiting propagation of DNA methylation and inducing re-expression of silent genes, including tumor suppressor genes.  Re-establishment of tumor suppressor gene expression would be expected to have an anti-tumor effect (decreased cancer cell replication) as would reactivation of genes instrumental for cell senescence and apoptosis (increased cancer cell death). </strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can result in changes in gene expression for the life of the altered cell and, if mitotically heritable, for the life of the individual.  The changes in the epigenome would have to go through epigenetic reprogramming in order to be ‘reset’ to the normal state, and those periods only occur during embryogenesis and germ cell formation.  During these “sensitive periods” alterations in epigenetic marks can be set and passed on to subsequent generations of cells.  Sensitive periods in epigenetic occur during periods of embryogenesis and gametogenesis when epigenetic marks are being established rather than maintained.  Xenobiotics that alter epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods can have dramatic effects on the epigenetic make-up of the individual and influence adult health because the changes are mitotically heritable.  In theory, some epigenetic alterations during sensitive periods may be transgenerationally transmitted, resulting in effects beyond the person being treated.  For these reasons, the use of drugs that have high potential to alter epigenetic marks should be avoided during early pregnancy and times of germ cell development.</strong></p></div>
