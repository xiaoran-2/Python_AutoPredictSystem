    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methlayion involves the addition of a methyl group from the methyl donor SAM to the 5' carbon of the cytosine ring via DMNTs. In general, in silenced genes, CpG islands are methylated and in transcriptionally active genes, they are hypomethylated. In general, in cancer cells, DNA methylation occurs more frequently at CpG islands, where as the rest of the genome tends to be hypomethylated. CpG islands are generally found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Their hypermethylation results in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes which are involved in the repair of cell damage, cell death and growth inhibition. This can lead to Cancer. This can however lead to an ideal biomarker for the detection of Cancer. Since most Cpg islands are hypomethylated, it is easier to detect those which are hypermethalyed. An example of this is the hypermethylation of GSTP1 in the detection of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. DNA methylation at these areas helps regulate transcription. This prevents transcription from occuring in areas where it should not be happening maintaing genomic stability. At these areas in cancer cells, they tend to be hypomethylated. This reduces the level of methylation and so can activate genes. The hypomethylation of microRNAs in cancer cells varies depending on the role of the particular microRNA. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is a certain length of time during childhood which is important for development. There are a number of sensitive periods of development. From birth to 6 years is when the mind is most absorbent and when it comes to terms with the senses, from one and a half to 3 is when a child lays its language foundations, from 4 to 6 is when a child develops its reading and maths readiness. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 contains an imprinting control region. This region is differentially methylated at CpG islands due to parental inheritance. In general the paternal copy is methylated and as a result is silent and not expressed, where as the maternal copy is hypomethylated leading to it being expressed by the offspring. However IGF2 is the opposite to this with the non-imprinted allele inherited from the father being expressed. </p>
<p>Loss of Imprinting (LOI) occurs in Wilm's tumour. This leads to the maternal chromosome reversing to the paternal epigenotype. This leads to IGF2 being turned on and H19 being turned off. This is turn leads to increased cell growth resulting in a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltranferase inhibitor, also known as a DNA-demethylating agent. This can be used to<span> treat myelodysplastic syndromes which can eventually lead to<span> acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine works on cells while they are replicating but is not cancer cell specific. However, as cancer cells replicate at a higher rate, it does affect them more. Even so, at high levels Decitabine is toxic as it is non-specific. It works by binding to DNA methyltransferases. Then when the DMNT1 tries to copy the methylation to the daughter strand it cannot because the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly. This prevents proliferation elading to tumour growth.</span></span></span></p></div>
