DNA methylation has been shown to be essential for normal development, X-chromosome inactivation, imprinting and the suppression of parasitic DNA sequences. DNA methylation can cause an increase in mutation rate and heritably silence genes whose promoters are associated with CpG islands and which control cellular proliferation.</p>
<p>Normal methylation patterns are frequently disrupted in tumor cells with global hypomethylation accompanying region-specific hypermethylation. When these hypermethylation events occur within the promoter of a tumor suppressor gene they will silence the gene and provide the cell with a growth advantage in a manner akin to deletions or mutations. In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with global hypomethylation of repeat-rich intergenic regions and hypermethylation of a subset of CpG-dense gene-associated regions (CpG islands). In mammalian species, DNA methylation occurs on the number 5 carbon of the pyrimidine ring of cytosines within the context of the CpG dinucleotide.  CpGs can, however, be found near the expected frequency in clusters referred to as CpG islands. CpG islands have presumably retained their CpG content throughout evolution by virtue of their unmethylated, and thus more stable, status within the germ line. DNA methylation patterns in human cancer cells are considerably distorted. Typically, cancer cells exhibit hypomethylation of intergenic regions that normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content. Consequently, transposable elements may become active and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells. Simultaneously, cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation within the promoter regions of many CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes, such as the retinoblastoma gene (<em>RB1</em>), glutatione <em>S</em>-transferase pi (<em>GSTP1</em>), and E-cadherin (<em>CDH1</em>), these regulatory genes are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

It is methylated on the paternal allele, and  unmethylated on the maternal. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, and the enhancers will act on H19. Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele without expression.  On the paternal allele the enhancers act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding, and IGF2 is </span></span> <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">expressed from the pattern allele. However, with loss of imprinting and what happened if you have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. On the maternal allele, have expression of Igf2. At this point we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison with a normal cell.  Igf2 is both growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. This is this particular childhood kidney genome that is observed. Loss of imprinting is observed in a very wide array of tumor types. And in fact, occurs as a very early event, so it's often seen in </span></span> <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">preneoplastic tissues. This suggests that maybe these events at the imprint control regions, these hypermethylation, or hypomethylation events. Might be very early events in tumor regenesis. </span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

<p>The mechanistic for the activity of decitabine is unclearly, but reactivated expression of TSGs is commonly implicated because these genes have roles in cellular differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and checkpoint control. decitabine could act as a chemosensitizer by reactivating TSG expression during the window of exposure to cytotoxic induction chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Decitabine and azacitidine are members of a growing list of epigenetic drugs that can alter gene expression and other aspects of cell function without affecting the DNA. Originally developed as nucleoside analogs, the drugs clearly cause DNA damage at high doses. Decitabine and azacitidine inhibited cell growth and caused tumors to shrink in a xenograft model of breast cancer. Low doses of the DNA demethylating agents restored function to pathways that had been silenced during development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

These ocurr when the epigenome is actively remodeled and include primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm and preimplantation and postimplantation periods. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">DNA methylation occurs by covalent addition at the 5' carbon of cytosine ring, resulting in 5-methylcytosine.These methyl groups inhibit transcription.  CpG islands are typically found in or near promoter regions of genes, where transcription is initiated.<sup>  </sup>Epigenetic effects such as hypermethylation can also induce inevitable alterations in gene expression. Methylation of the DNA repair genes MLH1 and MGMT can lead to their inactivation, resulting in microsatellite instability and increased frequency of mutations. According to the 'two-hit' hypothesis proposed by Knudson, loss of function of both alleles in a given gene is required for malignant transformation. The first hit typically is in the form of a mutation in a critical gene, followed by loss of the wild-type allele through deletion or loss of heterozygosity. Many of these genes play a role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, signal transduction, and DNA repair, while others are implicated in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Gene silencing  may have a causal relationship with tumor development and progression.</span></span></p></div>
