    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mechanism by which gene expression is regulated.  Methylation typically occurs on cytosine bases adjacent to guanine bases, so called CpG units.  There is an inverse relationship between the extent of DNA methylation and gene expression. DNA methylation is generally low in areas of the promoter region of a gene (CpG islands), allowing for expression of the gene.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the situation is reversed, with hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and hypermethylation in the CpG islands or gene regulatory areas.  This results in transcriptional silencing of the associated gene. </p>
<p>In cases where the suppressed gene is a tumor suppressor, such as BRCA1, gene silencing enables growth of the tumor. </p>
<p>Normally, DNA is heavily methylated on the intergenic and repetitive elements of the chromosome.  This provides genetic stability and stabilizes the DNA.</p>
<p>In cancer these intergenic elements and repetitive elements are hypomethylation, leading to genetic instability, insertions, and deletions and gene transpositions. </p>
<p>All these events increase are genetic mutations and increase the likelihood of cancer.  Overall the situation is quite complex such that hypo as well as hyper epigenetic (DNA methylation) factors as well as and genetic factors (mutation) are involved in the origin and spread of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele</p>
<p>Several sites upstream of H19 are unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In tumors with, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting results in cancers, such as Wilm’s tumor, when the imprinted, normally silent allele that provides cells with a growth advantage is activated, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an anticancer drug that functions, at least in part, through inhibition of the enzyme DNMT, DNA methyltransferase.  This enzyme catalyzes the methylation of cytosine bases in DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA after phosphorylation.   The incorporated drug binds irreversibly to DNMT, reducing its catalytic activity. </p>
<p>Decitabine causes cell death by inhibiting DNMT and obstructing DNA synthesis and/or inducing structural instability and DNA damage.  In this way the drug acts by both an epigenetic (suppression of DNMT) and a genetic (suppression of DNA polymerase) mechanism. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA alterations can have enduring effects because such changes are maintained in a semi-conservative way through the action of DNA methyltransferase from one cell generation to the next.  In other words, the inherited strand that contains the changed methylation pattern serves as a template for DNA methyltransferase enzyme to methylate the complimentary strand. </p>
<p>A “sensitive period’ in the sense of epigenetics, is a time in an organisms development during which cell differentiation is highly subject to environmental influences.  These are periods when epigenetic patterns are subject to reconfiguration or "reprogramming."</p>
<p>The ages at which an organism is exposed to epigenetic-altering substances, such as DNA methylation disrupters, are a critical factor regarding the consequences of such exposure. Exposure during embryogenesis and gametogenisis are sensitive periods for many epigenetic effects of DNA methylation modifying drugs. </p>
<p>Treatments with agents that disrupt DNA methyalation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable since they would disrupt cellular reprogramming; the addition and deleting of epigenetic marks.  A disruption of these two biochemical events leads to abnormal developmental processes, including Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes, and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>
