<p>Answer</p>
<p>In cancer there are two types of DNA methylation alteration:</p>
<p>Locus specific Hypermethylation;</p>
<p>Hypermethylation occurs frequently in tumors. we know that  DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. . </p>
<p> And genome-wide Hypomethylation:</p>
<p>At repetitive regions and cpg poor promoter                                                           </p>
<p>Hypmethylation at Repeats</p>
<p>This leads to illegitimate recombination and reciprocal translocation</p>
<p>Hypomethylation Of CPG poor promoters</p>
<p>This results to activation of genes. Eg Activation of miRNA</p>
<p><strong>1a</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Answer:</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA, which occurs at cytosine. Methyl group is added to carbon -5 of cytosine</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CPG islands is associated with transcriptional silencing which helps maintain genetic stability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1b</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Answer</p>
<p>In cancer cell CPG islands are generally found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Cpg islands are either Hypermethylated or Hypomethylated:</p>
<p>Hypermethylation: of genes promoters can result in silencing of those genes.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation: of CpG dinucleotide in other parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements.</p>
<p>1c</p>
<p>Answer           </p>
<p>Hypermethylation:  </p>
<p>This is dangerous when genes that regulate cell cycle are involved, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>1d</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>At Intergenic regions:</p>
<p>To maintain genomic integrity and cryptic silencing of transcription</p>
<p>At Repetitive elements:</p>
<p>To avoid mutagenic transposition and silencing of transcriptional interference.</p>
<p> 1e</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>The intergenic region and the repetitive elements tends to be unmythylated and as a whole genome we see hypomethylation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1f</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>DNA that does not contain DNMT1, the cells shows genomic instability: Deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocation in chromosomes</p>
<p>Disruption at Repetitive elements contribution to disease:</p>
<p>Repetitive elements can make copies of themselves  and then jump out and paste themselves int another region. And this is mutagenic.</p>
<p>Disruption of methylation results in activation of mutagenic transposition which may cause illegimate recombination, transcriptional interference.</p>

<p> Answer            </p>
<p>Alteration of DNA methylation at ICRs( can be hypermethylation or hypomethylation), can still resut in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>This depends on the particular ICR and the function of the gene in the ICR. Eg wilm’s tum</p>
<p> </p>
<p> 2a</p>
<p><strong>answer</strong></p>
<p>The paternal genome is actively and rapidly demethylated. The demethylation occurs via Hydroxylation. In Igf2 cluster:</p>
<p>ICR is methylated thus preventing CTCF binding, making the enhancers free to act on paternal allele and promotes its expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2b</strong>  </p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>The maternal allele is demethylated very slowly and is dependent on cell division, In Igf2 cluster;</p>
<p>The ICR is unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind to it and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. So the enhancers act on H19 and enhance it expression.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2c</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Answer:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In wilm’s tumor we have loss of imprinting where both the paternal and maternal alleles are methylated resulting to the expression of igf2 in both alleles</p>
<p>Now here we have double dose of igf2 as compared to normal cells &amp; igf2 is growth promoting. T</p>
<p><strong>2d</strong></p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>diseases like:</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome;</p>
<p>we have loss of maternal like alleles and gain of two paternal like alleles; meaning growth promoting a lot and no supperession.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>

        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>3</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Azacitidine and decitabine are clinically active in MDS and other hematologic malignancies and may have therapeutic potential in other malignant disorders</p>
<p>Since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return.                                                 </p>
<p><strong>3a</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p> class of DNA methytransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3b</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Decitabine was seen to have a transient impact of inhibiting DNA methylation</p>
<p>decitabine, is a powerful inhibitors of DNA methylation.Because of the substitutin of the 5’ nitrogen atom in place of the carbon in Dna, DNMTs are trapped on the substituted DNA strand and methylation is inhibited. </p>
<p>Decitabine contains a deoxyribose group, so it is incorporated only into DNA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3c</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p>Clinical trials indicate that decitabine is active in patients with MDS and AML, with demethylation of the hypermethylated p15 gene occurring in MDS.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>4</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>During drug treatment, the drug targets particular region in the chromatin. For example the drug silence a particular region, this region along with the histone marks and chromatin remodelers are also changed. So after the treatment period the genome the cell won’t need to restore back to the original state and thereby having methylation effect beyond the treatment period.   </p>
<p><strong>4a</strong> </p>
<p>Answer:                                         </p>
<p>Lets consider x inactivation in calico cats.</p>
<p>Calico cats have the gene that encodes color on the X-chromosome, so they can either have the ginger version or the black version.</p>
<p>Choice is made early in development to have the ginger version or black version being active. So we end up with mottled versions depending on which x to be inactivated.</p>
<p>Now this only occurs in female cats not in male thereby having enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4b</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period in development where the genome is most susceptible to environmental or external stimuli.</p>
<p><strong>4c</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Pre-implantation period and post-implantation period</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4d</strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of high susceptibility and unpredictability. There is no knowing of what might happen during treatment in the period. i.e. it might positive or negative effect during the period.</p>
