    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are generally unmethylated parts of the genome. And methylation of CpG islands almost always causes gene silencing. the Methylation of CpG Islands in cancer is significantly increased, refered to as CpG Hypermethylation. This is most likely because these epigenetice mutations on CpG islands are silenceing tumor supressor genes. DNA methylation at repetitive elements is used so that the segments of DNA that would , in the absence of methylation, would copy and insert themselves into other parts of the genome, would be silenced and closed off by the methylation so that they cannot replicate themselves into other part of the genome. This is done in the cell because if these segments of DNA did end up placing themselves inother parts of the genome they could endup causing lethal harm to the cell.  Overall Methylation is used to maintain genomic stability at these locations. Usually cancers display a combination of both the silencing of anit tumor cell death regions of the genome and the lack of silencing on repetitive and growth parts of the genome. Wherin usually the parts of the genome used primarily for early growth and development are unsilenced in the genome so the cell begins to grow rapidly into a tumor, while simultaneously the mechanisms to stop exactly that, by killing the cell, are silenced laeding to the growth and spreading of cancer</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Because DNA methylation primarily acts as a gene silencing mechanism it could have enduring efffects simply by silencing part of the genome that is crucial for a genes function, for example, if in one cell, part of the genome that is crucial for cell apoptosis (regulated cell death) is silenced then the cell would fail to kill itself when it become unhealthy or when it becomes cancerous.<br /> There are points in time in an organisms life when is epigenome goes through significant changes for the purposes of development, these are refered to as sensitive periods<br />one sensitive peroid would be the period when an embry os growing and is starting to from different cell types with in itself. So although all of the cells are coming from one original fertilized egg the cells following are epigenetically modified so that they take on properties of more specific cells such as skin cells or neuronal cells. Treating patients during sensitive periods is an issue because it could lead to improper or incomplete silencing or activation of different parts of the genome that could either cause a significant defect in growth or perhaps even prove to be fatal due to the failure of cells to control their epigenetic expression at all. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine works by the inhibition of the methylation of DNA, by inhibiting the methyltransferases that catalyze the methylation of DNA while a cell is dividing, so a cancer, where cells are dividng uncontrolably, would be impacted most severely by this drug.  By inhibiting the methylation of natural anti tumor parts of the genome it will allow cells to go through apoptosis in a healthy way and can prevent them from overgrowing. </p></div>
