    <h1>Submission 1125 from Anon (session_user_id: 3544f1a36e0e0cc157d57c25980dc427ac529be2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a cytidine analog) is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. It functions as a hypomethylating agent by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferase. The role of the drug in the treatment of these conditions is in the reversal of gene silencing mechanisms caused by methylation events. Demethylation reduces the stability of silencing signals and thus may allow reactivation of silenced genes, particularly tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and generally correlates with gene/transcription suppression, especially when found in promoter regions, 70% of which in humans have a high CpG content. Exceptions to cytosine methylation are CpG islands, which have a high CpG density and are usually free of methylation. In mammalian genomes CpG islands are typically 300-3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately 40% of promoters. In cancer cells however the promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated causing silencing of the underlying gene, often a tumour suppressor gene. Many cellular pathways are inactivated by this type of epigenetic lesion: DNA repair, cell cycle, apoptosis, cell adherence and detoxification some or all of which lead to disease and/or cancer progression. This has been seen in almost every tumor type.</p>
<p>Intergenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and the remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Methylation is also present in sections of highly expressed genes leading to speculation that it may also repress erroneous transcription from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing. Genomic regions associated with distinct DNA methylation patterns regulating gene expression profiles and chromatin compartmentalization have been identified.  Unlike the CpG islands, there is often an overall loss of DNA methylation in intra and intergenic regions in cancer. This results in increased genetic instability causing an overexpression of tumor promoting genes, translocations, inversions and other genetic lesions. The extent of the hypomethylation correlates with the grade of the resulting tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) for the IGF2/H19 cluster is normally methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele.  When unmethylated, the ICR allows the binding by the trancriptional repressor CTCF. The presence of CTCF acts as an insulator on the ICR, blocking access of the IGF promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene. This results normally in the imprinted expression of IGF from the paternal allele and its silencing in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Abnormalities in the expression of IGF may arise from a mutation/deletion causing the loss of imprinting, from paternal uniparental disomy, or (rarely) from epigenetic disruption causing loss of imprinting. The end result is that both parental alleles express IGF leading to its overexpression. This overexpression results in fetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia and a predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumours (but not adult tumours). Wilm's tumour is one such tumour in which loss of imprinting of the IGF2/H19 cluster causes the overexpression of IGF resulting form the expression of IGF from the maternal allele along with that from the paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Different members of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family of enzymes act either to set the initial pattern of methylation in a DNA sequence or as maintenance DNMTs, copying the methylation from an existing DNA strand to its newly synthesized partner strand after replication. This means that DNA methylation may be inherited through cell division, and that changes in DNA methylation may be long lived.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in the context of epigenomics is a time during which epigenetic reprogramming takes place and during which the environment may have an impact on epigentic control. There are two of these periods that affect the entire epigenome, the embryonic pre-implantation and early post-implantation period, and also the period from primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm cells. Both of these periods involve active remodelling of the epigenome. In addition, individual organs will have a brief period of sensitivity during key phases of their development, and recent studies have shown that neuronal epigenomics is affected by the early postnatal environment.</p>
<p>An abnormality arising during these epigenetic reprogramming periods could have serious consequences on the developing embryo/organ/gametes, and is therefore inadvisable to treat patients during these times with epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
