    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is laid own by de- novo methyl transine exclusively at CpG nuvferace . a Methyl group gets added to the cytosine, exclusively at CpG dinucleotide. Methylation is mainly associated with gene silencing but, it may have different functions as well, depending upon the place where methylation takes place and the parts affected.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation takes place via two pathways</p>
<p><strong>1. Locus- Specific Hypermethylation -</strong> In  normal cells, the CpG islands are unmethylated (or less methylated) but intergenic regions and introns of genes are methylated. In Cancer cells, vice verca happens i.e. the CpG islands get hypermetylated while the repetitive elements and intergenic regions loose their methylation. </p>
<p>CpG island Hypermethylation is found in promoters of tumour suppressor cells. Hence, the tumour Suppressor cells get silenced.this can cause continious division of cells and thus result in cancer. For eg</p>
<p>1, RB in retinoblastona (type of cancer in eye)</p>
<p>2. MLH1- colarectal cancer</p>
<p>3 BRCA1- breast cancer</p>
<p>the above mentioned  genes get mutated or hypermethylated and so may result in Cancer.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the CpG shores might get hypermethylated. these shores are the refions 2 kb upstream and downstream of CpG islands. since Hypermethylated gene promoter is highly unlikely to be expressed , when the shores get hypermethylaed, they get silences and alters gene expression.</p>
<p><strong>2 . Genome wide DNA hypomethylation- </strong>This includes hypomethylation of -</p>
<p>1. Repitative regions - this causes genomic instability - illegitimate recombination between repeats which happens due to an open chromatin. Normally, the chromatin are densely packed but due to hypomethylation, the intergenic regions get mis alligned. This may cause deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocation of genes due to gain or loss of a part of chromatin.</p>
<p>fo eg. Mutation in DNMT3B results in ICF syndrome- this is due to genomic instability.</p>
<p>2. CpG poor promoters- Hypomethylation of thes may cause activation of potent oncogenes. for eg. R-RAS in gastric cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a long non coding RNA, but it has nothing to do with imprinting of the cluster.te</p>
<p>the fifure shows a h19 cluseter which has- (in order from left to right )- Igf2(oncogene- growth promoter), ICR- which is bound by protein CTCF, H19 and lastly enhancers. </p>
<p><strong>Paternal allele -</strong> the ICR is methylated hence the H19 cluster is silenced. so, the enhancers act on Igf2 and so the function of IGf2 is enhanced in paternal alleles.</p>
<p><strong>Maternal allele- </strong>ICR is umethylated, hence it is bound with protein CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein and so it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. so, the enhancers act on H19</p>
<p>When imprinting of ICRs does not take place, ICRs get methylate in maternal allele as well. so, CTCF no more works as an insulator asnd the enhancers can freely enhance the activity of Igf2. thus, there is over expression of igf2 which results in Wilm's tumour. This is a childhood kidney tumour associated with growth promoters.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting may either cause a gene to be expressed from both parents or to be silenced.from both parents. this normally takes place at growth promoting or growth suppressing gene and thus may therefore result in cancer.  <br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-09651014e04fdd6a57f94538/970238/asst-5/970238-5212e03f1e2ae3.65435693.jpg" alt="" /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In therapy, mainly two kinds of driugs are being used now a days- DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors. Decitabine is an FDA approved DNMT inhibitor i.e. it tries to inhibit the function  that cause methylationof DNA methyl transferace. DNMT includes the enzyme that cause methylation. hence inhibiting DNMT means inhibiting methylation which is the main thing that needs to be done during cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Decitabine works as a nucleoside aalogue i.e. it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and when DNMT comes to bind the nucleotide(and thus cause methylation in the daughter cells), DNMTi is bounded instead and it cannot be removed. thus, it prevents further methylation and sometimes even furher division.</p>
<p>Thus, Decitabine is division dependent i.e. it works when the cell is replicating. since, cancer cells replicate at a faster rate, they get more severly affected. It majorly helps in improving the lifestyle and quality of life of old people suffering from cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA methylation, a methyl groups get added at cytosine to convert it to 5 methyl cytosine. This may affect the gene expression as methylation can mean silencing of genes. this is because MeCpG can bound to binding proteins and form MeCP1 and 2</p>
<p>1. MeCP protein have a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain</p>
<p>2, MeCP proteins recruit some factors that condence the chromatin</p>
<p>3. MeCpG may stop transcriptional factors from binding.</p>
<p>There are periods in life cycle when the cells are more susceptible to methylation and demethylation. During these periods, demethylation of almost all the cells takes place and then they again get methylate.These periods are known as sensitive periods in the life cycle. They include-</p>
<p>1.Period of development from premordial germ cells to gametes  </p>
<p>2.Preimplantation and early post implantation period</p>
<p>During both these periods, there is active re modelling of the genome.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive period would be inadvisable. This is because, this is the period when already genomic remodelling is going on.if patients are treated during this time, there is a fair chance of their epigenome getting remodelled and they may again get the disease again. </p></div>
