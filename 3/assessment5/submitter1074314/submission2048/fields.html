    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display numerous alterations compared to the epigenome  of the normal cells. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation, causing instability and deregulations of tissue specific and imprinted genes, or silencing of tumour suppressors.</p>
<p>-High frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP ( CpG island methylator phenotype), which is identified in colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>-DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.</p>
<p>- In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.</p>
<p>-The pattern in genes whose breakage leads to cancer switches it on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and acetyl groups. Overactivity methylates histones more than they should and thus silences the genes they surround (including tumour-suppressor genes) and cause mutation which would lead to cancer.  </p>
<p>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. Overexpression of satellite repeats was also identified in pancreatic and other epithelial cancers lately, indicating that disruption of heterochromatin may result in genomic instability in a variety of human cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications relies on lncRNAs ( “adaptor platforms”) for interactions between chromatin, remodeling, recruiting and directing chromatin remodeling complexes to specific loci in the genome. It invovles silencing and imprinting, eg. imprinting processes are the paternally expressed lncRNA AIR, required for silencing  maternally expressed protein-coding genes Igf2r(enhance blocker).</p>
<p>Paternal allele- there is CTCF (insulator protein) which insulates Igf2 from downstream. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding and without it, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. If complications occur, the upregulation of Igf2 (growth promoting) .</p>
<p>Maternal allele- it behaves like paternal allele which causes Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which may cause mutation or deletion to cause loss of imprinting; </p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, allele loss has been shown to be specific for the maternally inherited allele, (imprinting of genes within regions of common allele los)s. The insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (<em>IGF2</em>) is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed).</p>
<p>Disrupting the <em>IGF2-H19</em> region results changes in expression and growth disorders(BWS). DNA methylation of the ICR prevents <em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> from binding with the insulator protein, CTCF. Local changes in histone modifications and CTCF binding at the ICR in BWS and SRS together with DNA methylation correlate with the higher order chromatin structure at the locus.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) which caueses a rare illess called <span>cutaneous T-cell lymphoma</span>.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation <em>in vitro </em>, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genethat are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation, and the reversal of that silencing could have antitumor effects.</p>
<p><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span>Rather than killing cancer cells by damaging their DNA or disrupting vital communication pathways, epigenetic therapy(chemotherapy) attempts to change the behavior of cancer cells by blocking chemical changes to DNA</span><span>, including mythelation</span><span>. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It is possible that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></p>
<p><span>These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior of the human body. When taking medication like Decitabine, it causes the reversal of the silencing gene that stops unnatural growth. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Experiments in rodents(also seen in humans) continue to show that experiences d</span>uring a sensitive periods of development <span>influence DNA <span>methylation patterns of several genes, and this period </span></span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">is sufficient to induce </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">epigenetic modifications that alter HPA activity, taking drugs may cause complications to the process. That is why it is inadvisable to treat patients during the sensitive period. </span></p>
