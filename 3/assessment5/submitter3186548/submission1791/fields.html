    <div class="field-value"><p>In the human genome, methylation of DNA generally acts to silence gene expression. Methyl groups attach to the cytosine nucleotide. When the genome is examined as a whole, there is generally a high-level of methylation. However CpG islands, which are areas rich in CG nucleotides, tend to have very low levels of methylation. In cancer, the opposite is seen: there is hypomethylation genome-wide, but hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores. These CpG islands and CpG island shores can contain tumor suppressor genes, therefore silencing them with methylation acts to allow tumor growth. Alternatively, hypomethylation in other areas of the genome such as the repetitive regions and intergenic regions can contribute to cancer. Hypomethylation of these areas causes genomic instability which increases the likelihood of deletions, insertions, and/or translocations in the genome. This then alters DNA function and can allow uncontrolled growth of cells (tumors).  Imprint control regions (ICRs) may be hypo or hypermethylated; either of these scenarios can contribute to loss of imprinting and increased tumor growth, depending on whether the altered methylation is seen on a growth restricting gene or growth promoting gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting causes a specific parental allele to be expressed, as opposed to non-imprinted genes in which expression of alleles is more random. DNA methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) can cause silencing or overexpression depending on the function of the gene. The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of a paternally imprinted gene. In this case, the imprinting acts as an enhancer blocker. Igf2 is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele. When Igf2 is unmethylated, an insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the ICR. This blocks the enhancers from activated Igf2, but allows expression of H19. When Igf2 is methylated, the insulator CTCF does not bind so Igf2 is expressed. Additionally, the methylation spreads to the promoter region of H19, silencing its expression. Therefore Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele and H19 is only expressed from the maternal allele. Igf2 is an oncogene so if there is a disruption in imprinting it can cause overexpression leading to tumor growth. In Wilm’s tumor, there is an overexpression of Igf2 and underexpression of Cdkn1c (a tumor suppressor gene), both contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi).  These agents serve to remove methyl groups from DNA. In cancer, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands. DNMTi are thought to prevent that methylation process as cells divide so the cells revert to a more “normal” methylation pattern. This will allow tumor suppressor genes to be expressed adequately and oncogenes to be silenced as in healthy cells.  DNMTi’s act globally on the genome (as opposed to being gene specific) so there can be concern as to the negative impacts that may occur on non-cancerous cells. However, it is being found that at relatively low doses there is an anti-neoplastic effect without having global negative effects. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic change which maintains through mitosis, therefore if DNA methylation is altered it will remain altered in progeny cells not just the original cell. For an older adult, this impact will only be seen in their own cells. However, younger adults are in a sensitive period because germ cells are still developing. The altered DNA methylation carries over to the germ cells. This altered DNA methylation pattern will then be passed down to the person’s offspring if they reproduce. This could potentially have a negative impact by suppressing genes that need to be expressed during growth and development.  This type of treatment, therefore, would not be advisable for a young adult in that sensitive period.</p></div>
