    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGIs) normally serves to silence the expression of a gene when the methylated CGI appears in the promoter region of that gene. Therefore, promoter CGIs with significant methylation will fundamentally silence the associated gene and unmethylated promoter CGIs will be associated with gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer CGI methylation is altered. In particular, hypermethylation occurs in CGIs especially in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. In other words, genes that usually actively suppress tumours and that are not usually methylated at their promoter CGIs become significantly methylated (hypermethylated). Therefore, these genes are "silenced" or suppressed themselves thereby allowing cancerous tumours to grow unencumbered.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serves to stabilize the genome. For example, transposons can be maintained inert thus preventing mutations; or promoters with smaller CGI regions (CpG-poor promoters) can continue to silence genes that would otherwise lead to disease.</p>
<p>During cancer hypomethylation (or de-methylation) occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.This hypomethylation causes destabilization of the genome by allowing transposons and repeat elements to be read during transcription which leads to genetic mutations caused by codons that are misinterpreted due to insertions, deletions and transpositions. Furthermore, CpG-poor promoters are hypomethylated possibly leading to the activation and expression of previously silenced "oncogenes". Also, hypomethylation can activate micro RNAs that then attack tumour suppressor genes, thus once again allowing tumours to grow unencumbered. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the paternal allele contains DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) for the H19/Igf2 cluster preventing CTCF from binding which causes the H19 promoter to become methylated thereby allowing enhancers to cause expression of Igf2. On the other hand, in a normal maternal allele Igf2 is prevented from being expressed because the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF is able to bind thus insulating Igf2 from the enhancers and allowing for the expression of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour however, imprinting is lost. The maternal allele displays a methylation pattern that mimics the paternal allele. In this instance the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in both the maternal and paternal alleles allowing for the expression of Igf2 from both alleles. In other words, there is an excess of Igf2. It is this "overgrowth" that contributes to disease. When imprinting is lost the maternal allele acts like a paternal allele allowing the presence of too much Igf2 which if left to grow unencumbered can lead to tumour growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a "DNA demethylating agent". As the name suggests, Decitabine leads to hypomethylation. Decitabine allows for the demethylation of tumour suppressor genes. By demethylating tumour suppressor genes these genes will be activated. Accordingly, tumour suppressor genes when expressed act to negate the growth of tumours.</p>
<p>As a result, Decitabine demethylates tumour suppressor genes leading to their activation which in turn causes their expression to kill cancer cells and control cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable. In other words, the changes will remain intact through cell division thereby allowing replication of the altered DNA methylation pattern in daughter cells. Therefore, the altered DNA methylation pattern becomes the "new norm".</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods when the environment can have an impact on epigenetics. In other words, experiences and environment leave their lasting mark on the epigenome. In epigenetics the sensitive periods are the pre-implantation period to the very early post-implantation period, as well as the period when primordial germs cells are produced through to mature egg and sperm cells. These are both periods of epigenetic reprogramming. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could have unknown transgenerational consequenses.</p></div>
