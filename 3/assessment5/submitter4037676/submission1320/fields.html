    <div class="field-value"><p>Abberations of DNA methylation in cancer are characterized by global DNA hypomethylation but locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands and their shores. CpG enriched sequences are characteristic for promotor regions of many genes. In normal cells they are generally hypomethylated and therefore active, enabling transcription of their respective genes, amongst others tumor suppressor genes. These tumor suppressors, e.g. BRCA1, will then contribute to balancing cell growth and proliferation and some even chromatin architecture. In contrast in cancer cells these CpG enriched promotor regions are often hypermethylated, thereby silencing the expression of these tumor suppressors and other affected genes, promoting cell growth and proliferation. Hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type. There are even cancers displaying frequent methylation of a <em>set of genes</em>, termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-cancers.</p>
<p>Most regions in the genome consist of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, which are generally hypermethylated and therfore silenced. This is especially valid for repetitive elements, such as LINEs, transposable elements and satellites, but also for intragenic elements. Silencing of repetitive elements ensures genomic stability. Silencing of intragenic regions represses alternative start sites and antisense transcription and even seems to direct RNA splicing. In neoplastic cells these regions become progressively hypomethylated. Active repetitive elements promote genomic instability. Active repeats facilitate illegtimate recombinations between non-sister chromosomes resulting in Deletions, Insertions and Translocations. Active trasposable elements are able to relocate themselves within the genome. Hypomethylated intragenic regions activate cryptic promotors thereby raising transcriptional noise (Hassler et al., 2012) and disrupting neighboring genes as seen e.g. in murine A(vy) allele. This way oncogenes or cell cycle regulators may by downregulated. Global hypomethylation is the first detectable epigenetic abnormality in all tumor types. But again specific hypomethylation effects vary by location and the location varies by tumor type.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 locus is an imprinted region. Many genes in humans are imprinted to ensure dosis compensation. In this case the locus contains in 5'end to 3'end direction the following regions: the Igf2 gene coding for insulin-like growth factor 2, an oncogene; an ICR region; the H19 locus coding for a long non-coding RNA, which restrains growth followed by shared enhancers. Normally the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation spreads downstream into the H19 cluster silencing it and the enhancers promote transcription of Igf2 via DNA looping. On the maternal allele the ICR is methylated resulting in binding of CTCF insulator protein. This protein prevents interaction of the enhancers with Igf2 and instead promotes interaction with the H19 promotor resulting in active transcription of this tumor suppressor lncRNA. In cancer imprinted regions are often hypomethylated. Loss of imprinting at the locus results in the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele. Igf2 expression is enhanced, H19 expression decreases dramatically leading to intense proliferation and Wilms tumor, a rare form of kidney cancer. Igf2 as oncogene promotes cell growth and proliferation and with disrupted imprinting is no longer balanced by tumor suppressor H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer DNA Methylation is abberant. That includes locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG rich promotors, effectively silencing their controlled genes, which are often tumor suppressor genes. These genes normally stop uncontrolled cell growth, but are silenced in cancer. Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), administered to patients with Myeloplastic syndrome or AML to inhibit DNA methylation. Decitabine is a nucleotide analogue that is incorporated into the DNA during replication. After incorporation it irreversibly binds DNMTs thereby inhibiting further DNA methylation. Since cancer cells are continuously dividing, the effect of the drug is more severe than in other tissues. Treated cells with less DNA methylation pass these changes mitotically on to their daughter cells, whose CpG rich promotors are then less methylated and the downstream tumor suppressors are expressed. Decitabine treatment can therefore decelerate cancer cell proliferation and invert the global DNA-hypomethylation associated with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes of DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. Cells with abberant epigenetic regulation may pass on the epigenetic dysregulation to all their progenitors. But treatment with drugs altering DNA methylation relies on the same mechanism. Since treated cells continue to divide, all daughter cells will inherit the changes caused by the drug maybe even until the primary aberrations are erased. But there is one problem: these drugs work systemic, not just in cancer cells. </p>
<p>In embryonic development occurs a global clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks to ensure totypotency. Another wave of reprogramming occurs in the embryo during the development of the primordial germ cells. These developmental timespans are termed sensitive periods, because disruption of the epigenetic machinery will have drastic results in the embryo or its future offspring. </p>
<p>Administering drugs targeting DNA methylation enzymes to patients during these sensitive periods (pregnant women) is highly inadvisable, because it will have severe effects on the fetus. Treating children is also problematic, because their germ cells are not fully developed and may be affected. But also because the drugs act systemic. Children are developing and still have a long lifespan ahead during which consequences of the drug treatment may arise.</p>
