    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">DNA methylation at CPG islands is symmetrically laid down and maintained by De Novo Methyl-transferases (DNMT3a/b and DNMT1). These ‘islands’ are found at the promoter regions of genes, where more CpG dinucleotides than would be probabilistically expected are found, and the islands <em>tend</em> to be protected against methylation, though if the island is methylated, the gene is silenced.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In cancer, as normal tissue moves towards a cancerous state, normal DNA methylation decreases, but methylation at certain CpG islands increases abnormally. In general, CpG islands tend to be hyper-methylated in cancer and is in general more frequent than mutations. Disruption of CpG island methylation contributes to disease, since the methylation may silence tumor suppressor genes, which allows tumors to grow.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> Where CpG islands are <em>usually</em> protected against methylation, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are <em>usually</em> methylated, and in their cases, methylation does not necessarily mean silencing. Rather, in intergenic regions, methylation has the functions of maintaining genomic integrity (decreasing the frequency of deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations) and silencing cryptic transcription start and splice sites. In the repetitive elements, methylation works to silence repeats in order to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference of strong promoters, and may also prevent illegitimate recombination, since that requires an open chromatin structure.  </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In cancer, we tend to see genome-wide hypo-methylation as compared to CpG hyper-methylation, and this hypo-methylation is found to some extent in every tumor. It allows for more genomic instability, and can also result in disruption to neighboring genes, which is problematic in cancer and other diseases. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In both cases, DNA methylation contributes to cancer but in context-dependent ways. Some tumors are driven by tumor suppressor hyper-methylation; others are driven by chromosomal instability (hypo-methylation). </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is important to note that methylation at Imprint Control Regions does not necessarily mean silencing. At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Maternal ICR is unmethylated, while the Paternal ICR is methylated. In the maternal unmethylated version, the ICR is able to bind to CTCF, an insulator protein, which, by preventing downstream enhancers from accessing the Igf2 cluster, forces them to work on H19. Therefore, H19 is only expressed from the maternal, unmethylated, genome. In the paternal genome, CTCF is unable to bind, so the enhancers work to express the Igf2 cluster, which is therefore only expressed from the paternal, methylated, genome. The methylation spreads to H19 here and silences its expression from the paternal genome.<br /> In Wilm’s Tumor, Igf2 (a growth-promoting oncogene) is upregulated and its imprinting is disrupted by an antisense transcript that runs in a reverse direction from Igf2. Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressor, is also lost, so the combination leads to a lot of growth promotion. This loss of imprinting is a common hallmark, not only of Wilm’s Tumor and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, but also of many other diseases.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Decitabine is a FDA-approved DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor (DNMTi), used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome that progresses to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). DNMT inhibitors work by irreversibly binding DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA, which means that the action is replication dependent, so cancer cells (which replicate more) will be more severely impacted. At very high doses, DNMTi is toxic and not very helpful at working on tumors, but at lower doses, it causes DNA de-methylation. It is suspected that the reason for which it works so well on Myelodysplastic syndrome is that the disease is dependent on CpG Island Hyper-methylation, so decreasing the amount of methylation would have a huge impact on the tumors. Decitabine is still being tested on solid tumors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Altering DNA methylation can have a lasting effect on the epigenome, since one of the main points of epigenetic marks is that they are mitotically heritable and are therefore maintained throughout the life of the organism, in all daughter cells. Since epigenetic control is critical for all cell types, a drug that is designed for certain (cancer) cells may have side effects in all the cells. If the DNA methylation marks were altered early on, especially in a sensitive period, it could cause long-term consequences. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a sensitive period, extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs and the embryo is especially vulnerable to outside stimuli. In development, these periods are predominantly during the establishment of epigenetic marks rather than maintenance, and therefore the sensitive periods of development are during early development and primordial germ cell development. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, if drugs were used to alter the DNA methylation of a cell, effects might last far beyond the period of treatment, and may cause permanent change. If this occurred during a sensitive period when epigenetic marks were being established, the altered methylation state could likely become an integral part of the organism’s epigenome, and may even carry on into the those of the organism’s offspring.</span></p></div>
