    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome corresponding to normal cells. There are two types of DNA methylation abnormalities: Locus specific DNA hypermethylation and Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. The former is more likely to occur at CpG islands.</p>
<p>In normal cells the CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, while intragenic regions, repetitive elements and even introns are hypermethylated. In contrast in cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, while intragenic regions, repetitive elements and even introns are more likely to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>This hypermethylation of locus specific DNA regions causes genomic instability, deregulation of genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Generally, these hypermethylated regions in cancer cells corresponds to promoters or CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes, which are genes responsible for controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. If these genes are inactive the cell is able to proliferate wildly.</p>
<p>Another discovery about DNA methylation of CpG islands is that not only the CpG regions can be methylated in cancer cells, but also the regions neighboring the CpG islands, called CpG islands shores. This region surrounds the CpG island, 2Kb upstream or downstream, and it is also hypermethylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements has the function of maintain genomic stability. However, in cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated, so the genome is unstable, allowing illegitim chromosomes recombination in the intragenic regions. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements allow them to jump around the genome or they have their promoters activated leading to transcriptional aberrations in the surrounding regions.</p>
<p>Finally, DNA methylation in cancer can be a biomarker and could be used diagnostically, prognostically and to treatment outcome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer cells is they generally loss of imprinted genes. Genes that should be displayed monoallelic are displayed from both parental alleles or silenced from both parental alleles. In other words, genes can be hyper or hypomethylated. The reason why this happens in cancer is because lots of imprinted genes are involved in cell growth promoting or suppressing.</p>
<p>For example, in normal cells in H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. In the maternal allele, where the ICR is not methylated the CTCF binds to the ICR, the enhancers will activate the H19, consequently the Igf2 won’t be expressed. On the other hand, in the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, the CTCF can’t bind to the ICR, the enhancer is now able to activate Igf2 which is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour what happens is a loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of the ICR in the maternal allele. Consequentlly Igf2 is expressed from both paternal and maternal allele. Igf2 is a growth promoter associated with this tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic modifications could be reversible, the epimutations might be an interesting target for therapies. Several research groups developed different drugs aiming to alter the epigenome.</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline group developed GSK2816126. This substance inhibits the activity of an enzyme that attaches methyl groups to histone proteins. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute described a substance called JQ1, which inhibits BRD4, a substance that blocks the activity of <em>Myc</em>. <em>Myc</em> encodes a transcription factor that is generally altered in cancer.</p>
<p>Neither GSK2816126 nor JQ1 is ready for human trials, however two other drugs are on the market: azacitidine and decitabine.  Both are DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Consequently for those diseases which have hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes resulting in loss of control upon cell cycle this drug could have some effect preventing the hypermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer DNA methylation is context dependent. Different tumors have different needs and the effect of DNA methylation can be stage specific. Generally what happens is hypomethylation of genome-wide and hypermethylation of CpG islands responsible for tumor surpessor genes promoter’s. However, depending on the tumor and on the stage of the tumor the methylation state can change.</p>
<p>The dynamic pattern of tumors and the dynamic changings inside each tumor difficults the development of therapeutic drugs. Nevertheless, is important to keep in mind that these drugs have effect over the whole body, all of body cells. It is extremely important to be careful with young people, particularly those who still have developing germ cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is characterized by reprogramming of DNA methylation during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. The most important sensitive periods are germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p></div>
