    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For start I would describe that the DNA methylation on the CPG islands is used to silence an expression of a gene.  In cancer this type of methylation is interrupted causing that the CpG islands start having methylations or in other case a hypermethylation but therefore we could think that a hypermethylation will help to fight this disease but is the opposite effect.  The genes that encodes for tumor suppressor where silence too and here is when the uncontrolled growth start.  On the other hand we know that the DNA methylation acts in the intergenic regions and the repetitive regions, the way that this work is that DNA methylate these regions for maintaining the integrity of the DNA and avoid the possibility of a transposon gene.  The disruption of the DNA methylation on this regions would trigger a lot of other reactions like the transcription of the genes that are close to this regions causing a loss of integrity an activating the oncogenes that were silenced when the methylation was put on the gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a new drug that his goal is to treat the cancer patients.  This drug is part of the family of epigenetics inhibitors more specific a DNA methyltransferasa inhibitor.  The principal effect of this drug is hypomethylation on the DNA.  The hypomethylation is a decrease of the methylation of cytosine and adenosine residues of the DNA.  Some researchers said that Decitabine could have an anti-tumoral effect because when she gets activated the percentage of regions on the DNA that are methylated significantly decreases, causing that the other parts of the gene reactivate there effect of tumor suppressors, because they would restore the downstream transcription of the gene, generation the proteins and sensor that the body needs to combat this disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation can cause that the DNA restore the downstream transcription this would improve the genome giving him the boost that is needed for combat the cells that are first differentiated to tumor.  Then when the daughter cells pass her genomes to her daughter this modifications makes the cell more susceptible to be kill by the drugs that the patient where exposed.  This effect could be more bigger if the drug is provided on the sensitive period that is when the DNA are suffering changes and everything has an impact on them.</p></div>
