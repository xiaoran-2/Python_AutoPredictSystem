    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are some cases when dusruption of imprinting patterns can lead to  Wilm's tumour. Let us consider as an example H19/lgf2 cluster. For normal cells in paternal allele ICR region is methylated and therefore CTCF is not bound to it enabling enhancers to bind to lgf2, leading to its expression. In contrast, maternal allele is unmethylated therefore enhancers can act over H19 expresing this gene, however lgf2 is not expressed. In Wilm's tumour both maternal and paternal ICR's are methylated, therefore there is a double dose expression of lgf2. Because lgf2 is growth promoting gene the increased dose of it will result in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         Both hypermethylation by locus specific manner and hypomethylation by genome wide manner can lead to cancer development. In normal cells CpG islands in the promotor region of many tumour suppressor genes  are hypomethylated, therefore it is active  and tumour formation is depressed. However in cancer cells these islands tend to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation can influence single gene or sets of gene as well.Usually it is found that hypermethylation occurs at CpG island shores, in other words the region 2kb neighboring to the CpG island can also be methylated. This process(methylation of CpG islands) is continues and reversible , so as time does by some epimutation might accumulate leading to cancer development.  </p>
<p>        The normal cells have methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, thus maintaining the genomic stability.This is partly accomplished  by the heterochromatin structure formation, because methylated chrosome tends to be compacted and inactive. However, when these regions are hypomethylated illegitimate recombinations between homologous repeats, unwanted activation of some promoters expressing unwanted proteins, activation of transposonal activity, deletions and insertions can occur. All of the abovementioned processes are abnormal therefore they might change normal functions of the cells and usually leads to some type of the cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent which might be used to treat the myelodysplastic syndrome. This agent can erase the methyl groups thus weakening hypermethylation status, therefore some tumour suppressing genes can be reactivated after several divisions. The outcome is decrease of the tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore the effect of the treatment might exist even after the treatment is over.This happens due to DNMTs which methylate douther strand in accordance with the parent strand methylation pattern.Maintaining the methylational pattern  is very important especially during sensitive periods, which are periods in development of organism when the epigenetic marks are erased and newly written. Two periods can be mentioned: germ cell develoment and clearing of the imprinting marks. It is important to not to disturb these periods since , it is possible to change the epigenetic marks and therefore to alter the normal marks of the genetic material.  </p></div>
