    <div class="field-value"><p>While DNA methylation is mutagenic in itself, it is altered in cancer by the deletion or mutation of DNA methyltransferases and the switching of methylation between different areas of the gene. CpG islands are normally unmethylated, despite their methylation being a stable genetic mark, except during embryogenesis, primordial germ cell development and cell differentiation. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the following gene expression through forming a repressive chromatin structure or by prohibiting transcription factor binding.</p>
<p>Disruption of CpG islands in cancer occurs when there is more DNA methylation than normal, or locus-specific DNA hypermethylation, following alterations to the DNA methylation at other areas, for example the repetitive elements. This hypermethylation increases the suppression of gene expression at CpG islands and when found in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes, it contributes to cancer by silencing tumour suppressor genes. These genes would normally monitor and regulate the growth of cells so their suppression allows an increase of cell proliferation, creating a tumour.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability and prevent gene transposition and/or wrongful recombination. These areas are usually methylated however when there is hypermethylation at CpG islands then there is less DNA methylation, or hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This creates genomic instability, which can produce an abnormal karyotype through allowing gene transposition or recombination and deletion or insertion of extra genes. DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also lead to the activation of repeats and promoters, which may disrupt neighbouring cells as the DNA is not densely packaged down into heterochromatin as it should be when the DNA methylation is normal.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele’s ICR has DNA methylation so CTCF cannot bind to it. DNA methylation of the ICR also methylates the H19 promoter. This H19 promoter is silenced by its DNA methylation so enhancers, downstream of H19, can form a loop to activate and express Igf2. The maternal allele’s ICR is unmethylated so CTCF can bind to and insulate it. The H19 promoter is also not methylated and can be expressed. H19 expression means enhancers cannot activate Igf2 so it is silenced on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation usually occurs on growth-promoting genes. Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene and imprinting disruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster through a mutation, deletion or the inheritance of two copies of one parental chromosome (uniparental disomy) can contribute to diseases such as Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome where there is over-expression of growth through Igf2. Loss of imprinting through DNA hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele causes it to behave like the paternal allele that has DNA hypermethylation of the ICR. When both parental alleles are DNA hypermethylated together, it causes Igf2 to be expressed twice and this over-expression then leads to the formation of Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating epigenetic inhibitors. It is a nuceloside analogue and acts in the same way as nucleosides in DNA synthesis. Decitabine binds to and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, preventing the addition of a methyl group to CpG dinucleotides. Decitabine relies on cell replication to work and, once incorporated into the DNA, Decitabine cannot be released and is passed on to all daughter cells. As Decitabine inhibits the DNA methyltransferase so it prevents DNA methylation and leads to hypomethylation within the gene.</p>
<p>Cancer cells in particular are more highly affected by Decitabine as they divide and replicate more often than normal, non-cancerous cells. In high doses Decitabine is toxic yet low doses can have an anti-tumour effect by decreasing the amount of suppression expressed on tumour suppressor genes. These genes are then able to regulate cell growth and prevent the formation of a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering gene DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as changes to reduce or increase DNA methylation in expressed genes from associated cells will be permanently incorporated into the DNA. This mutation will continue to be replicated and therefore last far beyond the period of drug treatment. Eventually the mutation will be passed through DNA from parent to daughter cells during mitosis.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development when the epigenome is remodelled. All previous epigenetic marks are removed and new ones are established within the DNA. Sensitive periods are when influences, such as diet, can have the maximum impact on the genome. Two sensitive periods are the primordial germ cell development through to mature gametes, the sperm and eggs, and both the preimplantation and postimplantation stages of the embryo.</p>
<p>Any harmful mutations as a result of the drug usage could be passed on to future offspring as the epigenetic mutations may be passed to the gametes, so treating patients during sensitive periods would be unadvisable. The epigenetic mutations would not be removed during the sensitive periods, unlike imprinted genes, and would pass from daughter cells to granddaughter cells through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance as a result.</p></div>
