    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated. But in cancer cell, CpG islands are methylated. In other words, CpG islands in cancer cell cannot be translated (in general). CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor gene at tumor tissues. This epigenetic way of silence tumor suppressor gene is mitotically hereditable, so is a good mechanism to silence genes that attach cancer cells. Indeed, silence tumor suppressor gene give advantage on his cancer cell to divide more rapidly, in other words, die lately.</p>
<p>In normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. As cancer grows, these parts of the gene are more unmethylated (introns of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements). This process of unmethylated is progressive and occurs in tumorgenesis (early stage of tumor tissues). Intergenic regions and repetitive elements have to be silence. These parts of the gene bring genomic instability when they are unmethylated because they change his chromatin from heterochromatin to euchromatin. So recombination, deletion and insertion of karytipe can occur. Repetitive elements are activated; they make a copy of themselves and jump into surrounding gene. That process disrupts coding genome. This copy of repetitive elements is called transposons.</p>
<p>Low methylated genome in embryo will die around mid-gestation. Methylated genome is very important, so have a gene that has silence Dnmt1 (DNA methyltranferase 1) develop tumorgenesis and death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylations are maintained by mitotically hereditable. So daughter, granddaughter and the offspring in general brings this epigenetics changes. In the development of the mammals, we have moments that are very important because DNA methylation falls in all cells and we can reprogram these epigenetics marks. These moments are two, in early stage of development (from fertilized egg to epiblast), and the second is in the primordial germ cells. In this way, we would wait the treatment at this moment because the reprogramming can make our job.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of imprinting silence through DNA methylated. In paternal allele, ICR is methylated. On the other hand, maternal allele has ICR unmethylated. So it’s a paternally imprinted. When ICR is methylated, the DNA methylated spread to H19 gene, so this gene is actually silence. CTCF doesn’t bind ICR because is methylated, and enhancers promote the expression of Igf2. Meanwhile in maternal allele, ICR isn’t methylated and the insulator protein CTCF bind ICR. This complex changes the target of these enhancers. So the complex block the Igf2 way and promote the H19 gene way. In other words, in paternal allele the ICR is methylated and Igf2 is expressed by enhancers, however in maternal allele CTCF bind ICR and enhancers enhance to H19 expression.</p>
<p>Imprinted genes are associated with promoting or suppression of growing tumor. In a hypermethylated, maternal allele at the H19/Igf cluster is obviously methylated on his ICR. So we have double doses of Igf2. Igf2 is a tumor growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, in other words, is a DNA- demethylation agent. When DNMT is changed by cancer, has affect DNA and the tumor grows.This epigenetic drug is not good at high doses because is toxic and nonspecific. However, if we apply very low doses, attach the tumor. This Japanese drug has very good neo-plastic effect in lower doses. When Doctors and company apply this treatment, Decitabine get incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT comes to act, Decitabine follow this protein and binds to block it in daughter strand. Decitabine is division dependent. If we remember, cancer cells, who has silence suppressor gene, realize division more rapidly than normal cells. In this way, cancer cells are more affected than others.</p></div>
