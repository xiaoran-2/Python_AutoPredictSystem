    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern of DNA methylation changes from a normal to a cancer cell. In mammal genome, the cytosine modification of the CpG dinucleotides occurs frequently in normal cells. But in the CpG islands of promoters, the cytosine is not methylated, independently of the activity of the respective gene. The unmethylated state of the CpG islands allows transcription machinery to bind and transcript the gene.</p>
<p>Usually, in cancer there is a genome-wide loss of methylation and gain of methylation at certain specific sites. In cancer cells, the CpG islands are highly methylated, leading to the silencing of the respective gene, which can be a tumor suppressor gene, for example, leading to deregulated cell cycle, apoptosis mechanisms and DNA repair.</p>
<p>Repetitive regions and intergenic regions are methylated in normal cells, because the methylation maintains genomic integrity, preventing transposition, transcriptional interference of strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, the loss of methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic region leads to genetic instability and disruption of genomic integrity.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting allows monoallelic gene expression to occur, based on parent-of-origin of the allele. The imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) and can differ depending on the tissue.</p>
<p>An imprint disorder can occur because of genetic or epigenetic abnormalities, leading to deregulated gene expression. An imprint disorder, such as in the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to upregulation of an oncogene (Igf2 in this case), which leads to growth promotion and tumor development.</p>
<p>Normally, in this cluster, when ICR is methylated (as in the paternal allele), the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind it, allowing the spread of DNA methylation to H19 promoter, silencing it, which allows the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated (imprinted), leading to Igf2 expression and the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, leading to silencing of Igf2. So, the level of Igf2 expression is balanced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, disruption of imprinting caused by deletions, mutations or epigenetic alterations, leads the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, which causes an overdose of the oncogene Igf2. This will cause growth promotion and predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is already used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that can evolve to leukaemia. Decitabine removes methyl groups incorporated in DNA. In cancer, there is a genome-wide loss of methylation and gain of methylation at certain specific sites. Therefore, this drug would remove methyl marks from hypermethylated regions (CpG islands, for instance) of the cancer cell genome, reverting the repression of tumor suppressor genes, and restoring, at least in part, the normal gene expression pattern and slowing tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic marks seems to be transmitted during cell division, the effects caused by the drug on DNA epigenetic marks could be passed on to the next cell generations, unless an active clearance happens in epigenetic marks. This clearance can happen mainly in 2 sensitive periods: epigenetic reprogramming during pre-implantation/early development period and during primordial cell development. During these periods, demethylation occurs and then new marks are established. Thus, because of the risk of severe side effects, this treatment should be avoided in pregnant women or very young child, where the normal epigenetic reprograming is taking place and still can be remodeled.</p></div>
