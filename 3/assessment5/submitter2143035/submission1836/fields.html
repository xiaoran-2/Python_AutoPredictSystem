    <h1>Submission 1836 from Anon (session_user_id: d7379c721f1bcd3ba7cd6a8c3068220d6fe62840)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleotide analogue that is incorporated in the DNA and causes the inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), which means that the use of decitabine in the treatment of cancer leads to a hypomethylation of DNA, because DNMT after binding to decitabine in the DNA are blocked. </p>
<p>Decitabine has been demonstrated to be effective only at myelodysplastic syndrome, and the reason for that is not entirely clear, but is possible to be due the dependence of CpG island hypermethylation for this syndrome, it means that the hypomethylation caused by decitabine interferes in the development of myelodysplastic syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>CpG islands typically occur at or near the transcription start site of genes, and methylation at CpG islands results in the silencing of gene expression, that's why, these regions are usually protected from methylation.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer cells, DNA methylation of CpG is disrupted, specifically in the regions at tumor supressor genes, resulting in the silencing of the expression of these genes. During the evolution of the disease, we have a correlation between progression and increase in the leveles of CpG island methylation.</span></p>
<p><span>The methylation found in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are most associated to genomic stability, means to avoid illigimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters. In cancer cells, we have a hypomethylation of intergenenic and repetitive elements, resulting in the increase of genomic instability, generating abnormal karyotype of the cells, due to deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations. All these alterations contributes to the disease development and progress.   </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprinted control region (ICR) of H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, which blocks the binding of CTCF, outcoming in action of the enhancers in the Igf2, resulting in the Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, leading to CTCF binding and the action of enhancers is directed to H19, blocking Igf2 expression.   </p>
<p>In the Wilm's tumor we have loss of imprinting and in this case the maternal ICR is also methylated, resulting  also in the expression of Igf2. So, now we have a double dose of Igf2 in comparison with normal cells, and as Igf2 is a growth promoter, Wilm's tumor is generated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the reasons that modifications in DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome is that because this modification is inheritable and cause genome imprinting. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods, can be definied as the stages where the organism is more propense to suffer modifications in the epigenome that eill be transfer to the next generations or to the cells. During these periods, we have the phases of development where we have clearing of epigenetic marks, more specifically during the germ cell development and early embryonic development. That's why we must have caution in treat patients during sensitive periods, as the drugs used usually acts modifying the epigenetic marks, and these alterations will be inheritable and can cause effects on germ cells. </p></div>
