    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Typically DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoters inhibit transcription of genes and typically these CpG islands in healthy tissues are largely unmethylated. </li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands are relatively hypermethylated. </li>
<li>Hypermethylation in cancer of CpG islands can inhibit transcription of tumor suppressor genes.  </li>
<li>In contrast, intragenic regions and repetitive elements are typically heavily methylated. Such methylation prevents these regions from causing genomic instability.  </li>
<li>However, in cancer, these regions are relatively hypomethylated which can cause genomic instability. </li>
<li>Genomic instability can lead mutations or translocations that can lead to over expression of oncogenes.  </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Typically the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated. Methhylation of this paternal allele prevents  CTCF binding and prevents the expression of H19. Instead enhancers can enable IGF2 expression and promotes growth. </li>
<li>The maternal ICR of this cluster is unmethylated which allows CTCF binding and enhancers to act on preferential expression of H19 over Igf2, thus inhibiting growth.  </li>
<li>In Wilms tumor there is hypermethylation of both alleles leading to both alleles acting in the paternal fashion. </li>
<li>In Wilms tumor hypermethylation of both alleles of the ICR of H19/Igf2 leads to overexpression of Igf2 occurs leading to overgrowth.  </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. </li>
<li>It acts as a nucleoside analogue to prevent DNMT1 from binding and methylating a region of DNA. The result is less methylation. </li>
<li>The mechanism of action as an antineoplastic agenet for myelodysplastic syndrome is unknown but may be related to allowing tumor suppressors to be expressed that otherwise would have been inhibited by hypermethylation. </li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Epigenetic drugs may have enduring effects because of mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks. </li>
<li>A sensitive period is a susceptibility time window when epigenetic changes are occurring and thus environmental (in this case a pharmaceutical) exposure may affect the epigenome during this time but not during a less dynamic period. </li>
<li>There are a few very sensitive time periods. One is just just after fertilization in early embryogenesis when there is a rapid loss of DNA methylation and remethylation.  The second is during primordial germ cell development with similar demethylation and remethylation. </li>
<li>Treating patients with DNMT inhibitors or other epigenetic drugs during these times would be inadvisable because healthy development may be disrupted and the negative effects could be widespread. In contrast for a grown adult or elderly person who has rapidly dividing cells in a tumor, these cells may be the most sensitive cells in the body the drugs and such drugs might be effective with less far-reaching consequences for healthy tissues elsewhere.</li>
