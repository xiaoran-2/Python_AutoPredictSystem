    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can occur due to covalent addition of a methyl group at the 5' carbon of the cytosine ring producing 5-methylcytosine. These methyl groups can effectively inhibit transcription. In mammalian DNA, 5-methylcytosine is found primarily at cytosine–guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs). These CpGs occur more frequently at CpG islands, small stretches of DNA, located near promoter regions of genes where transcription is initiated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the basis of imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation represses transcription by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors essential for development and functioning. It is also important for silencing of gene expression and maintenance of gene stability. Loss of normal DNA methylation in somatic cells results in loss of growth control.</p>
<p>In cancer, epigenetic silencing through methylation leads to aberrant silencing of normal tumor-suppressor function. In Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) hypermethylation results in leukemic transformation. Methylation of the DNA repair genes <em>MLH1</em> and <em>MGMT</em> can lead to their inactivation, resulting in microsatellite instability and increased frequency of mutations, respectively.</p>
<p>DNA methylation keeps the genome stable by inhibiting loss, gain or illegitimate recombination.  Hypermethylation of repeats or intergenic intervals leads to alignment, misalignment, and illegitimate recombination. The repeats, when hypomethylated, can become activated, make a copy of them and jump around the genome. They may disrupt the coding region of a gene and may activate neighboring genes causing transcriptional aberrations in the surrounding regions due to deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations.</p>
<p>In ICF syndrome (the immunodeficiency and cranio-facial defects syndrome) resulting from a mutation in DNMT3B in humans.</p>
<p>In mouse models, DNMT1 null embryo, an embryo that has no DNA methyltransferase 1-enzyme maintaining methyltransferase, will die around mid gestation. Adult mice with decreased DNMT1 in particular tissues remain viable but develop cancer. Absence of DNA methylation results in genomic instability in that particular tissue giving rise to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells can display loss of imprinting meaning loss of monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression and these can be either expressed or remain silent in both parental alleles.</p>
<p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. They can either be growth promoting or growth suppressing. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation are both found in cancer depending upon specific imprint control region (ICR) and the function of the genes that are found in the region.</p>
<p>In the IGF2 H19 cluster the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 binds its insulator element so enhancers will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele and will not be expressed. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF4 is not binding to insulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting there will also be hyper-methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. As a result there will be expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele resulting in a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and can cause Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation. After cellular uptake and phosphorylation it is incorporated into DNA in place of cytosine. Because of the substitution of the 5' nitrogen in place of the carbon, the DNMTs are trapped on the substituted DNA strand and methylation is inhibited. In presence of this analog, a significant proportion of the DNA becomes hemimethylated. A second round of DNA synthesis in the presence of this drug results in full double-stranded DNA demethylation. The action of DNMTI is division dependent and can occur in replicating cells. Cancer cells divide much more rapidly and will be affected more than other non replicating cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore functions to genes critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p>
<p>When used in lower doses they have a very good anti-neoplastic effect by causing DNA hypo methylation, at least in some cases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although the mechanism by which epigenetic drugs can alter tumour cells and make them more susceptible to other chemotherapy is not clearly known. Epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable through cell divisions and are also irreversible. It is possible that epigenetic therapies can result in changes in cancer cells. DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can reactivate epigenetically silenced genes and restore normal gene function resulting in expression of tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory functions inducing growth arrest and apoptosis.</p>
<p>DNA methyl transferase inhibitors act on all replicating cells of the body.</p>
<p>Gastrulation is the most sensitive period to external insults. During this period extensive cellular differentiation occurs.</p>
<p>During gonadal sex determination the germ-cell DNA is demethylated and remethylated. This is a critical and sensitive period in establishing the epigenomic structure.</p>
<p>During early stem cell development there is global remodeling which requires methylation in mammalian cells and disruption of this will result in death of an embryo. Embryonic stem cells containing reduced or elevation levels of methylation are viable but unable to differentiate.</p>
<p>Treating patients in the sensitive periods may result in widespread changes in the epigenetic machinery due to derangement in DNA methylation. There may be decreased growth, developmental anomalies and death.</p>
