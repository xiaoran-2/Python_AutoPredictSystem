    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the methylation at CpG sites precludes recruitment of certain proteins.</p>
<p>In most cells CpG islands are found upstream the genes. Unmethylated they allow to transcribe vital genes. Nonetheless, the CpG sites are also found in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even in the introns. In normal, somatic cell rarely are the CpG islands methylated as the others CpG sites are methylated. The reverse situation is observed in cancer cells: the CpG islands are more probable to be methylated. That fact is explained the 'need' of tumour to turn off the transcription of tumour suppressors.</p>
<p>The methylation of CpG islands may lead to normal cell functions failure – the cell stops producing proteins typical for its tissue. The methylation of tumour suppressors (BRCA1-breast cancer; RB-retinoblastoma; MLH1-colorectal cancer; MGMT-glioma) causes loss of control over growth and multiplication of the cell. As the methylation grows, next phases of tumour expansions are observed.</p>
<p>The main role of methylating the repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. The repetitive elements are often transposons – labile elements of genome, probably ‘inherited’ from viruses. Their methylation prevents ‘invasion’ through the genome especially if they are under a strong promoter. The mutation meC -&gt; T might have been a self-defence mean. Moreover unmethylated repetitive elements and intergenic regions allow mutations on the stage of chromosome (recombination, insertion, deletion, duplication…). The methylation in introns and intergenic regions prevents them from being transcribed leading to unwanted RNAs.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions, repetitive and intragenic elements are usually demethylated in cancer cells. It leads to genomic instability, chromosome mutations, chaotic gene expression and ‘immortality’ (famous HELA cells). The basic evidence of the facts correlation was an experiment with mice Dnmt1 knock out.</p>
<p>It shall be remembered that the GpC poor promoters retains unmethylated – it may lead to proto-oncogens activation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Not only are the CpG sites mentioned in the above question ill-methylated. There is also a serious failure in ICR methylation control and preservation.</p>
<p>At chromosome 11 we find a ICR called H19/ Igf2 cluster. At the train there are: an Igf2 gene, CTCF protein binding site, H19 promoter and the enhancers downstream. At the paternal allele the CTFpbs is methylated and therefore the enhancers can interact with Igf2 gene and so the expression of the gene is observed. Whereas, at maternal allele we do not observe such methylation – the CTF is able to bind, preventing the enhancers interaction with Igf2 and causing interaction with gene H19 promoter. In that situation the expression of maternal allele of Igf2 gene is not observed.</p>
<p>In some cancers methylation of maternal CTFpbs is observed. The cause is excessive production of Igf2 protein in the cell. As the growth factor Igf2 causes overall growth of a tissue. Moreover, the H19 is not transcribed any more. H19 is important thus to its growth resistant properties. This factors may cause Wilm’s tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatoblastoma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. As a cytidine analog, it builds into DNA strains in dividing cells. Than the decitabine protein in the strain binds to DNMT active site and blocks it permanently. This leads to loss of DNMT activity.</p>
<p>It shall be remarked that in high concentration the DNMTi are toxic for patients. Their chemotherapeutic effect is much more specific in lower doses. The fast dividing neoplasm cells are much tenderer than somatic cells in exposition to DNMTi. It is probably due to the mechanism of the drug mechanism of working – it only builds into dividing cells strains. The observed effect may be called ‘loss of malignacy identity’. Very good therapeutic effect is observed in treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. This is explained by high methylation on some CpG islands in that type of neoplasm.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is genetically heritable – once methylated CpG is methylated in the all daughter cells. The DNMTi prevents methylation in the daughter cell. So in the first generation the site shall be hemimethylated. In the second generation half of cells will not have not a sign on the site.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is time, when the epigenetic marks are removed end reestablished. This happens two times during each generation: during pre-implantation period and during germ cells development. In the first the epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished at all sites excepting ICR and mostly repetitive elements. Whereas, in the latter the methylation at ICR is removed and reestablished.</p>
<p>DNMTi as other drugs interfering with enzymatic epigenetic machinery would be inadvisable for parents and especially pregnant mothers. First of all, their germ cells would have unmethylated ICRs which may lead to some serious diseases (for instance Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes). Secondly, the conceptus would have unmethylated sites in the genome. In mice DNMT cnock out is lethal. Probably similar effect would be observed in humans taking ‘epigenetic drugs’. The conceptus would also be liable to fetal tumors and ill ICR methylation. The second could have effect in grandchildren of a person taking drug.</p></div>
