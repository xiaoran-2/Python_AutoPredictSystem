    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands and genes are hypomethylated  and  intergenic  regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated   .</p>
<p>Unmethylated CpG islands and genes are related to active gene expression by enabling the binding of transcription factors .</p>
<p>CpG island methylation ensures tissue appropriate gene silencing by recruiting repressor complexes MeCP1 or MeCP2 or directly (more rarely ) repress transcription factor binding . meCP proteines can recruite other complexes that result in histone modifications and condense the chromatin to heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Methylation is  also responsible for maternal or paternal gene imprinting during germ cell production  and is required for normal embryogenic development . Methylation of intergenic regions ensures genome integrity avoiding  transcription interference. Repetitive elements  are effective promotor/transcription factor binders and need to be silenced by methylation to avoid transpositions, transcriptional interference,iligitimate recombinations furthermore ,  mutation of meC to T fr avoids transpositions .</p>
<p>DNA methylation is maintained by a copying mechanism (Dnmt 1,2 or 3) during cell division( apart from a period during early germ cell development ,when al CpG island and imprinting  methylation is erased and early embryonic development when only CpG island methylation is erased . In both cases methylation is later re-established )</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands ,CpG island shores and genes are hypermethylated particularely  tumor suppresor genes , and intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated . The gene silencing is further elaborated by histone modifications and chromatine condensing to heterochromatin . </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements  results in overall genome instability i.e transcriptional interference ,illigitimate recombination and transpositions .</p>
<p>Cancer cells resemble pluripotent cells and outgrow normal cells due to the suppresion of the tumor suppresor genes .</p>
<p>The normal cell development  is disrupted due to an interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors i.e progressive disruption  of normal gene methylation . Some genetic factors already identified are  mutations in  genes related to chromatin related enzymes and proteins ,mutations in genes associated with DNA methylation or DNA repair (cellular stress) etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The structure of the Igf2 cluster is as follows Igf2-ICE-H19-E . E is an enhancer required to reach the gene  to enable gene expression .</p>
<p> In the maternal allele ICE is unmehylated and binds CTCF a zinc finger insulator proteine , prohibiting the enhancer to reach Igf2 ,consequently Igf2 is suppressed and H19 is expressed .   In the paternal allele ICE is methylated and cannot bind CTCF  consequently Igf2 is expressed and H19 is suppressed ;</p>
<p>In  cancer cells both maternal and paternal alleles have the paternal strucure i.e ICE is methylated resulting in overexpression of Ifg2 and underexpression of H19 .</p>
<p> Igf2 encodes an insuline like growth factor . Overexpression of Igf2 in mice resulted in overgrowth and large tongues (symptomes of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome ) .Aberrant methylation at the H19/Igf2 cluster has also been indentified in individuals with Wilm,s tumour but not suffering from BWS indicating that the timing of the epigenetic defect might dictate whether the total organism or only an organ is affected.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA cytosine methylation . Decitabine is 5-aza-2 deoxycytidine which is incorporated in the DNA of replicating cells after being metabolized to the appropriate deoxynucleoside triphosphate . Once incorporated it interacts with all three known DNA methyltransferases inhibiting DNA methylation in subsequent rounds of DNA synthesis . Therefore the demethylation is mitotically progressive and although affecting all cells it is most effective in cancer cells who divide most . The effect is lasting since once the methyl group is erased it does not return . Decitabine at low doses has been  succesfully used in the treatment of myeloid dysplastic syndrome a pre-leukemic condition occuring mainly in elderly patients for which CpG hypermethylation is an indicator of poor prognosis . Preliminary experiments have indicated that the p15 tumour suppressor gene becomes demethylated following  decitabine treatment however the overall mechanism of the drug is not yet clear .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Demethylation of DNA due to the administering of azacitidine can activate tumour suppresor and other  genes by progessively demethylating CpG islands and change the overall epigenetic structure . The  full deacetylase inhibitor mechanism is not clear it seems to be inhibiting both histone and other proteine deacetylases   </p>
<p>Since the mechanism of the drug azacitidine  is based on disrupting the methylation copying mechanism (see Q3) future cells wil be  progressively less methylated  .  Once methylation is erased it will not return hence the effect is lasting !</p>
<p>In view of the demethylation  action of the drug they should not be administered when active methylation reprogramming is happening during  early embryogenesis and during  periods of embryonic germcell development and later maturation in pre-puberty (9-12  years for males ; 8-10 and infant years for females) . During these periods methylation is partly erased (see Q1) and then reestablished . Administering azacitidine or dicitabine would disrupt the process of re-methylation possibly resulting in a miscariage if administered during embryogenesis or infertility if administered during germ cell production .</p></div>
