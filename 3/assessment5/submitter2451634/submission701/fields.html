    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (adding of methyl group on fifth carbon of cytosine base molecule) occurs almost exclusively on CpG dinucleotides in mammals, resulting in symmetrical methylation pattern on both DNA strands and therefore is maintained during mitosis. </p>
<p>The CpG dinucleotides can be found all over the genome, but the methylation occurs on specific sites, in normal cells: (i) CpG islands are located often at promotor regions, which are usually protected from methylation (= unmethylated in normal cells), on these sites methylation results in chormatin condensation and prohibits transcription factor binding; (ii) intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity, silencing cryptic transcription/splicing and preventing recombination. </p>
<p>In cancer cells: (i) CpG islands are hypermethylated (and also approx.2kb "shores" neighboring CpG islands) in contrast to normal cells; (ii) intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in contrast to CpG islands hypomethylated in cancer cells (hypomethylation is typically genome wide in cancer cells).</p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation on CpG islands mainly contributes to cancer progression via silencing of expression of tumor suppressor genes (in very simplified point of view, cancer is caused by overexpression of oncogenes and by insufficient function of tumor suppressor genes). On the other hand, hypomethylation of  intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to activation of repeats and transposons, recombination, activation of cryptic promotors - generally results in genomic instability. </p>
<p>Both DNA methylation changes in cancer progress in time, probably due to clonal selection (epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable), providing growth advantages to certain cancer cell clone. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are expressed monoallelically in parent origin specific manner. Expression of imprinted genes is controlled via different methylation of ICRs (imprint control regions) on<span> maternal and paternal alleles.</span> </p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is regulated by an ICR, which contains multiple binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF. An unmethylated H19/Igf2<em> </em>ICR on the maternal allele allows binding of CTCF which blocks transcription of <em>IGF2</em> and activates <em>H19</em>, in turn inhibiting growth. On the contrary, on the paternal allele, H19/Igf2 ICR methylation blocks CTCF binding, and thus allows spread of the methylation to H19 promotor resulting in its silencing and allowing enhancers to access and activate the <em>IGF2</em> transcription which has growth promoting effect. </p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumor (kidney tumors in children) the H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated - methylated on both alleles resulting in paternal type of expression from both alleles and therefore high levels of Igf2 promoting growth. </p>
<p>I wouldn´t go into detail because they are not really known - like HOW exactly the loss of imprinting occurs and what is the role and mechanism of increased level of Igf2 in cancer development (<a href="http://www.ajsc.us/files/AJSC1108003.pdf">http://www.ajsc.us/files/AJSC1108003.pdf</a>). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is chemically 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and as an analogue of cytidine may be incorporated into DNA (similarly to the 5-azacytidine which can be incorporated both the DNA and RNA). Both have shown significant clinical benefits in treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a preleukemic bone marrow disorder.</p>
<p>Decitabine belongs to the hypomethylating agents. One of its effect on methylation is caused by its incorporation into DNA leading to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents further DNA methylation. Moreover the protein bound to DNA triggers DNA damage signaling resulting in the degradation of trapped DNA methyltransferase (and methylation marks become lost during DNA replication).</p>
<p>The rationale behind demethylation therapies is the ability of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to revert hypermethylation induced gene silencing. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells causes the silencing of expression of tumor suppressors genes which can be at least partially restored by decitabine. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The artificial altering of DNA methylation by drugs (hypomethylating agents like azacitidine and decitabine) can result in sustained decreases in genome-wide promoter DNA methylation, gene re-expression, and changes in cellular regulatory pathways. These drugs also <span>restored function to pathways that had been silenced during development. The effects include pathways involved in the cell cycle and in cell repair, maturation, differentiation, and programmed death. </span></p>
<p><span>In terms of epigenetics, there are two sensitive periods during development: early embryonic development and primordial germ cells development. During these two periods, epigenetic marks are erased and re-established. During these time periods any external interference altering any part of this process (removing or restoring of epigenetics marks) can cause irreversible and/or fatal changes in development of embryo or germ cells. It explains the inadvisability of administrating methylation altering agents to pregnant women. </span></p></div>
