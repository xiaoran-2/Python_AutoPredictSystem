    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of GpC islands  is one of the mechanisms for regulating gene expression.   GpC islands are found in or near the promoter site of many genes that regulate metabolism, development and tissue specificity. In normal cells, GpC islands are usually unmethylated, and the genes are expressed, as is the case for tumour suppressor genes.  In a majority of cancers, hypermethylation of GpC  islands occurs, leading to the silencing of tumour supressing gene expression. These changes are mitotically inheritable, and allow the cancer cells to rapidly be selected, leading to the growth of tumours. It also seems that GpC island methylation increases as individuals age.  In some forms of breast cancer, hypermethylation of the BRCA1 gene has been associated with silencing of this gene, which then leads to genomic instability and the accumulation of DNA damage. </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability.  In normal cells, there is widespread methylation of these areas.  In intergenic regions, DNA methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites and reduces transcriptional interference.  In repetitive elements, the silencing of the GpC islands of the promoters prevents the expression of the gag and pol genes, thus reducing transpositions.  The silencing of the strong promoters associated with repetitive elements also reduces the cryptic transcription of neighbouring genes.  Finally, the methylation of the repetitive elements may lead to compaction of the DNA, which helps to prevent inappropriate recombinations.  In cancer cells, the intergenic elements and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.  This leads to the possibility of inappropriate transcription, deletions, transpositions and other events which decrease the stability of the genome. In mouse models, the deletion of DNMT1, which is necessary for methylation, in specific tissues, has been found to result in tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, DNA methylation regulates gene expression by silencing genes .  During development, DNA methylation is laid down in somatic cells to allow differentiation, and these epigenic marks are mitotically inheritable.   If the pattern of DNA methylation is altered, then this may lead to inappropriate expression of genes, which in turn can lead to abnormal cell growth.  This altered pattern of DNA methylation will then be inherited by all the daughter cells.  DNA methylation is laid down mostly during the time between fertilization and the blastocyst stage, and this time is known as a sensitive period. If DNA methylation is altered, the embryo may not survive, or may have developmental problems. Another sensitive period is during germ cells development, when the reproductive cells are being established.  It would be inadvisable to treat patients with agents that interfere with DNA methylation during these sensitive periods as this could alter DNA methylation patterns and lead to a large number of problems in the somatic cells and in the developing germ cells.  Because altered germ cells line may be able to transmit the altered methylation patterns to the next generation, there is the possibility that the effects of the treatment might be transgenerational.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11.  Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes cell growth.  On chromosome 11, the imprint control center (ICR) is located between the Igf2 gene and the H19 gene. Enhancers are located downstream from the H19 gene. The expression of Igf2 is paternally imprinted since the ICR is methylated.  Methylation spreads from the ICR to the H19 promoter and silences the expression of that gene.  The enhancers are free act on Igf2 and cause the expression of the oncogene.   In the maternal chromosome, the ICR is not methylated, and  binds the CTCF protein.  The CTCF protein acts as an insulator protein, and prevents the enhancers from acting on Igf2.  Instead, the enhancers act on H19 and a lncRNA is produced.  Some patients with Wilm’s tumour exhibit paternal uniparental disomy, in which two copies of the imprinted paternal gene are inherited.  This leads to overexpression of the Igf2 oncogene, which may lead to abnormal cell growth.  Some patients exhibit a loss of imprinting (LOI) on the maternal chromosome, which also leads to overexpression of Igf2.  Igf2 LOI has also been associated with many tumours such as breast cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.   Once injected into the body, Decitabine is phosphorylated, and incorporated into the DNA of cells during replication.  It then irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases, rendering them inactive, which leads to hypomethylation of DNA.   <span class="apple-converted-space"> It is thought that by interfering with methylation, or by removing methylation, the normal function of tumour suppressor genes is restored.  This re-establishes control over cell growth. Since Decitabine must be incorporated into the DNA during replication, it seems to be incorporated mostly in cancer cells since they are replicating at a faster rate than normal cells. </span>  Decitabine is also an antimetabolite.  When the cells incorporate antimetabolites into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets in the cell to produce a cytotoxic effect that causes apoptosis of the dividing cancer cells.</p></div>
