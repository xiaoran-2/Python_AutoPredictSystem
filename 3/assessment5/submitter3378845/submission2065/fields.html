    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer at important genome regions, such as CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p><strong>CpG islands</strong> are regions at gene promoters that are usually kept in an unmethylated state in normal cells, regardless of the transcriptional activity state of each gene. Methylation of CpG islands causes gene silencing, and thus they are an inactivation epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, however, CpG islands (and the neighboring region called CpG island shores) tend to be hypermethylated, and this results in silencing of a subset of genes called <em>tumor suppressor genes</em>.</p>
<p>These tumor suppressor genes are a group of genes that control the mechanisms of apoptosis, cell division cycle and gene repair (among other cellular processes) Loss of activity of these genes is associated with disruptions of normal cell functions that promote cancer development. This is the way that methylation at CpG islands inhibits gene expression and promotes cancer.</p>
<p>At <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong>, DNA methylation plays a key role maintaining genomic integrity. Generally genomic integrity is conserved through inhibition of transcription which in the case of repetitive elements methylation leads to prevention of transposition. Other mechanisms include methylation-driven mutations (meC to T) and prevention of illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated, resulting in increased expression and increased probability of transposition of repetitive elements, and perhaps also increased expression at intergenic regions.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at repetitive elements might activate strong promoters that could activate transcription of oncogenes and it could also activate transposition of these elements, leading to alterations in the genomic code (mutations) that would eventually lead to cancer transformation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can result in altered expression of growth-promoting or growth restricting genes. This is well illustrated in the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>The ICR of the paternal allele is normally methylated. This has two consequences: first, hypermethylation prevents binding of an insulator protein (CTCF) that prevents the effects of downstream promoters on the Igf2 gene. Second, methylation spreads to the promoter of H19, silencing its transcription. Overall, this methylation profile leads to the expression of the Igf2 gene in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated, so it would bind CTCF and actively transcribe H19, which results in lack of expression of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the imprinting pattern is lost, and the ICR ofboth alleles is methylated, which leads to the expression of both paternal and maternal alleles of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>This overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoting gene, facilitates cell division and hence tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of a new class of drugs developed to inhibit DNA methyl-transferases enzymes (DNMTi)</p>
<p>This drug is a nucleoside analog that binds irreversibly to DNMT's after the nucleoside is incorporated in the DNA, and so is replication dependent.</p>
<p>When used at low doses, it has very good demethylating action, which diminishes at higher doses, as the toxic effects increases.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor effect would be due to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes (which were previously silenced through hypermethylation) The specificity on tumor cells is based on the replication dependent mode of action, since it would concentrate more in cells which are rapidly dividing (such as tumor cells)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of the epigenetic marks of the genome are mitotically heritable. This means that changes induced in the epigenome of a single cell will not only remain in that cell, but also in its daughter cells-in the case it undergoes cell division.</p>
<p>This is important for two reasons. One, the possible benefficial effect with subsequent treatment with standard chemotherapy.<br />The second reason concerns potential side effects by its action during <em>sensitive periods</em>. These are periods in which there are cells that are changing the epigenetic marks. Examples of sensitive periods of development are the preimplantation period after conception and the phase of formation and maturation of germinal stem cells.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these periods (pregnancy - prepuberal and puberal children) would be highly unadvisable since changes in the epigenome in this periods could lead to serious and heritable consequences that could mean, for example, fetal death, or congenital diseases.</p></div>
