    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands, which are often located at promoters of genes, is to silence of the expression of these genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands can lead to the silence of tumor suppressor genes and the abnormal growth of the tumor cells. It is often more frequent than mutations.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity by silence cryptic transcription start/splice sites. The normal function of DNA methylation in repetitive elements is also to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements lead to genomic instability: abnormal recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sometimes, imprinted control regions (ICRs) are hypermethylated, leading to the loss of expression of growth suppressor genes. Or they can be hypomethylated, resulting in overexpression of growth promoter genes. In the example of <em>H19/lgf2</em> cluster, the maternal allele is unmethylated. An insulator protein CTCF binds to the unmethylated form of ICR, which insulates <em>lgf2</em> from downstream enhancers. Enhancers act on the nearby <em>H19</em> to increase its expression and <em>lgf2</em> is silenced.</p>
<p>The paternal allele is methylated. Without the binding of CTCF, downstream enhancers can act on <em>lgf2</em> and <em>lgf2</em> is expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, both the parental and maternal allele are methylated. Two methylated alleles will result in twice the expression level of <em>lgf2</em>. <em>lgf2</em> is a growth promoting gene, and over-dose of it leads to the abnormal growth of cells (cancer).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It will irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase and thus hypomethylates DNA. The hypomethylation effect of Decitabine could reduce the abnormal CpG island hypermethylation in the cancer cells, leading to the re-activation of the tumor suppressor genes. Therefore, it is most effective to myelodysplastic syndrome, which is related to the hypermethylation of CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic markers can be mitotically heritable, so altering DNA methylation of one cell could affect all of its child cells. A sensitive period means when altered environment could affect the epigenetic control of the cell. There are two sensitive periods of development: one is from primordial germ cell development to the production of mature eggs or sperms, and the second is the pre-implantation and early post implantation period. Treating patients during sensitive periods would have an effect on the reprogramming of the epigenetic markers. For example, when the patient is young and the germ cells are still developing, the drug may interrupt the reprogramming and thus has a transgenerational effect. Also, if the patient is pregnant, the treatment would affect the regular epigenetic machinery of the child.</p></div>
