    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>     CpG islands locolazied around promoter regions of genes, are normally hypomethylated, which allows transcription of such genes. However in cancer we observe locus-specific hypermethylation of CpG islands, that normally would be found unmethylated. In many cases genes that are being affected by such hypermethylation of CpG islands, are tumorsupressor genes. Considering the fact that DNA methylation is a scilencing mark, selective hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer results in downregulation of tumorsupressor expression, which will lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>
<p>     In contrast to CpG islands, repetetive elements and intergenic regions of genome tend to be scilenced by extensive methylation. Repetitive intergenic elemets do not encode protein and tend to have transposonal activity, which might lead to DNA translocations and random insertions resulting in interuptions of coding sequences. Therefore metylation of such regions scilences transposonal activity. Cancer however, tends to express hypomethylation at intergenic repetitive elements, thus activating translocation activity of repetitive sequences. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In wild type genotype, paternal allele is methylated at imprint control region (ICR), which prevents binding of CTCF regulatory element to the control region, thus allowing a long-distance enhancer effect on Igf2 expression. In maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and it binds CTCF insulator element, which focuses enhacer action on H19 and prevents Igf2 transcription activation. In Wilm's tumor ICR beomes methylated in both alleles resulting in 2-fold upregulation of Igf2. In other words, methylation of maternal ICR prevents it from CTCF binding, thus making it analogous to paternal allele that expresses Igf2. Igf2 being a growth factor, promotes cell growth and proliferation, thus contriguting to the tumor development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylase epigenetic inhibitors. It inhibits action of DNA-methyltransferase, thus reducing levels of DNA methylation. In various cancers tumorsupressor genes tend to be hypermethylated at CpG islands. Such hypermethylation downregulates tumorsupressor expression, thus contributing to tumor proliferation. Decitabine will reduce level of methylation at tumorsupressor CpG islands, incressing its expression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable modification, therefore changes in methylation due to epigenetic drugs will propagate with cell divisions. Throughout development organism undergoes multiple stages, in two of which epigenome is being modified. These stages are early preimplantation development and premordial germ development. During these sensitive periods, paternal epigenome is being reistablished, and application of epigenetic drugs might introduce mistakes in the establishment of base-level epigenome. </p></div>
