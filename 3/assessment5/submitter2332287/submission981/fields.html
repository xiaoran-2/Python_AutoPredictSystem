    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, DNA methylation in CpGs islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements is altered. DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides in mammas. CpG dinucleotides clustered into CpG islands. CpG islands are often found at promoters of genes. Methylation at CpG islands means silencing of gene expression. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually protected from methylation to allow normal gene expression. Only small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated between different cell types, most retain unmethylated status. The fuction of CpG islands methylation is mainly shown in X inactivation as an epigenetic dosage compensation between male and female. In tumour cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated to silence normal gene expression, that is more likely to silence the tumour suppressor gene which may lead to cancer that driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation. Conversely, in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated to maintain genomic integrity and stability. Including silencing cryptic transcription stat sites or cryptic splice sites, silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoid trancriptional interference from strong promotors, mutation of the repeats (meCto T) to prevent transposition, metylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination. In tumour cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, result in genomic instability. Transcriptional interference, chromosomal delection, insertion, and recombination are more likely to happen. This may lead to cancer that is driven by chromosomal instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In tumour cells, imprinting was lost due to the alternations in DNA methylation at imprinting control region (ICR).These alternations can be hypo or hypermehylation, and can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. For example, the paternal imprinting <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster, in paternal genome, the ICR between<em> Igf2</em> and <em>H19</em> was methylated, the H19/Igf2 ICR can bind with an insulator protein CTCF which insulates the downstream enhancers from activate Igf2. The DNA methylation at ICR blocks bingding of CTCF, without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence and the downstream enhancers can access <em>Igf2</em> to activate. In maternal genome, the ICR was unmethylated, so it can bind with CTCF to insulate <em>Igf2</em> from activated by downstream enhancers, so <em>Igf2</em> was silent and <em>H19</em> was activated by the enhancers. In tumour cells, both maternal and paternal ICRs were methylated, both <em>H19</em> alleles were silent and both<em> Igf2 </em>alleles were expressed. Therefore, the dose of Igf2 was doubled. <em>Igf2</em> was growth promoting, overdose of IGF2 causes Wilsm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It was used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. DNA methylation is an epigenetic process which switches genes on or off, and is sensitive to chemical intervention. So it is possible to use drug which can regulate DNA methylation to treat disease. In normal cells, fuctional genes are unmethylated to make sure normal transcription and expression. DNA overmethylation silences gene expression, including tumour suppressor genes which can stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. As a DNA-demethylating agent, decitabine can target on particular site to decline the overmethylation which causes myeloma, without effect the normal cells surrounding. Reactive tumour suppressor genes to control cancer cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Baylin speculates that “epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.” That is quite possible because epigenetic changes are mitotic heritable. It means that, in tumour cells, any recovered epigenetic process can be passed on during cell division. Eventhough the epigenetic drug treatment stopped, the epigenetic changes in tumour cells caused by of the drug will passed on during mitosis. It seems like that the drug has a long lasting effect. In another hand, as epigenetic process is sensitive to medicine, using of epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, will disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming which result in severe disease. These sensitive periods include pre-implantation embryo development and primordial germ cell development. During pre-implantation period, embryo epigenetic marks will be erased and reprogrammed. During primordial germ cell development period, imprinting marks will be erased and reprogrammed. Once epigenetic programming has been disrupted, abnormal changes will be inherited during mitosis which may cause embryo lethal, infertile, and/or other severe disease. Therefore, epigenetic drugs should be avoid for women in early pregnancy and youths in pubertas.</p></div>
