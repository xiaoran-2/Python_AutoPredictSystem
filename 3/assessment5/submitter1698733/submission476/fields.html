    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer  there is an overall reduction in the number of cytosine–guanine (CpG) dinucleotides which are methylated throughout the genome, but also increased methylation in some locations such as CpG islands. CpG islands are stretches of the genome, on the order of 1000 bases long, in which the pattern CpG occurs frequently. They normally unmethylated in healthy tissue. Many CpG islands function as promoters of nearby genes, but only as long as they remain unmethylated. Methylation in CpG islands thus inhibits the normal expression of genes in a cell and since methylation is mitotically heritable, in all daughter cells as well. When a tumor suppressor gene is silenced, this contributes to oncogenesis. <br />Cancer's increased methylation of CpG islands stands in in contrast to the loss of normal methylation in the bulk of the genome. Methylation of oncogene promoters inhibits expression of genes that should not be expressed, at least not in this cell line and stage of life. Methylation of repetitive elements prevents several bad things. The activation of cryptic promoters within the repetitive elements alters gene expression levels. Some repetitive elements are capable of inserting additional copies of themselves into the genome if left unmethylated, disrupting gene expression at the insert site. When combined with underheterochomitization, hypomethylation encourages anomalous recombination between chromosomes, contributing to further genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) is a protein that encourages cell division and growth. The IGF2 gene is present in chromosome 11 downstream of the Cdkn1c/Kcnq1 cluster and upstream of CTCT, H19, and then of sites which can serve as enhancers of IGF2 transcription. IGF2 normally expresses only from its paternally inherited copy, the maternal gene is usually silent. </p>
<p>The silence of the maternal copy arises from two epigenetic conditions. First the maternal copy of Kcnq1 is methylated, which stops Kcnq1 promoting the expression IGF2, as it would do in its unmethylated state. Kcnq1 methylation has the additional effect of promoting tumor suppressor Cdkn1c. In the maternal line there is, in addition to Kcnq1 methylation, a lack of methylation in CTCT/H19 downstream of IGF2. In this unmethylated state, the CTCT/H19 region blocks the enhancers lying downstream from activating IGF2.</p>
<p>On the paternal chromosome, the epigenetic marks are reversed. Kcnq1 is left unmethylated,  promoting IGF2. In addition, methylation in the CTCT/H19 region allows the effect of the downstream enhancers to pass thru activating IGF2. </p>
<p>Without IGF2-silence on one chromosome too much is made, leading to overpoliferation in some tissues possibly <span>Wilm’s tumour. </span> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue metheyltransferase inhibitor. <br />Because DNA replication leaves once methylated sites hemi-methylated on the daughter chromosomes, methyltransferases are needed for a proliferating cell line to maintain imprinting. By inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferases, decitabine opposes cell divisions in which imprinted tumour suppressor genes remain imprinted. Since methylation is an important mechinism by which tumours silence tumour-suprressor genes, decitabine can prevent a tumour from growing whilst passing its epimutations to the next celluar generation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is normally maintained in daughter cells. A change in DNA methylation, like a change to the DNA itself, can be inherited through any number of cellular generations. Therefore there is no reason to expect the effects of a drug which alters methylation to cease when the drug is withdrawn. Unlike the DNA sequence however, DNA methylation is removed and reestablished durring certain 'sensitive periods'.  These sensitive periods are durring early embryonic development and and gametogenesis. Durring these periods newly established methylation is necessary to establish properly  functioning cell lines.</p></div>
