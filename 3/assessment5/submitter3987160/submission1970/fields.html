    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally unmethylated because CpG islands are typically found at promoter genes, and methylation of these islands would silence them.</p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands are instead hypermethylated, silencing any genes these islands may be found on.</p>
<p>This is thought to be because these CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, and methylating them would effectively silence the genes in a mitotically heritable fashion.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in a normal cell to maintain genomic stability throughout the cell.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell these regions are unmethylated. This leads to problems such as translational errors such as gain or loss or chromosomes and general genemic instability.</p>
<p>Essentially cancer simply reverses the methylation of the genes which throws the whole thing into chaos.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster works through enhancer blocking, meaning that downstream enhancers are either blocked or allowed in order to regulate H19/Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele there is an unmethylated imprint control region which allows the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein which prevents the downstream enhancers from enhancing Igf2 expression and forces them to enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated, preventing the binding of CTCF and allowing the enhancers to act upon and promote expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumours are caused by the insertion of a second paternal allele instead of a maternal allele, resulting in the loss of tumor and hrowth suppressor genes and an overabundance of Igf2, which is a growth promoter.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demthylating agent that works by binding to the enzymes that facilitate the methylation reaction and titrating them out.</p>
<p>This prevents the cancer from silencing tumour and growth suppresor genes and inhibits the growth of tumours themselves.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, alterations made to methylation will pass on to new cells and will continue to effect the epigenome of the subject.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in regards to epigenetics are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset.</p>
<p>These sensitive periods occur during primordial germ cell development and early embyrogenesis.</p>
