    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression. Normally CpG islands are unmethylated &amp; therefore expressed. In cancer, CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes progressively become more densely methylated resulting in silencing of the gene. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes as a result of methylation can be considered one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis. Loss of the function of a tumour suppressor gene enhances a cells ability to progress to cancer, particularly when compounded by other mutations. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressor genes is the most common hypermethylation in tumour cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic integrity. Hypomethylation of intergenic intervals results in genomic instability &amp; is evident in many human cancers. Hypomethylation most commonly occurs in repeats. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements results in:</p>
<ul><li>illegitimate recombinations between repeats leading to reciprocal translocations (due to misalignment of repeats that are unmethylated &amp; composed of euchromatin (open) instead of heterochromatin (closed))</li>
<li>activation of repeats that are able to copy themselves &amp; transposition (movement around genome)</li>
<li>activation of cryptic promoters &amp; disruption to neighbouring genes (e.g. actiavtion).</li>
</ul><p>Hypomethylation may also lead to the gain or loss of chromosomes. The overall outcome of hypomethylation of repeats &amp; intergenic regions is more insertions, deletions &amp; reciprocal translocations, &amp; therefore genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) controls the expression of imprinted genes.</p>
<p>The ICR is methylated in the paternal allele, which prevents CTCF (an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from down stream enhancers) from binding. As a result DNA methylation spreads from the ICR downstream to the H19 promoter to silence H19 promoter &amp; allow the enhancers to act on Igf2, promoting the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, which allows CTCF to bind, preventing the spread of DNA methylation downstream. Igf2 is also insulated from downstream enhancers by the CTCF resulting in no Igf2 expression from the maternal allele. The unmethylated H19 promoter enhances its own expression in combination with the action of the enhancers on the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, so disruption to imprinting is common in cancer.</p>
<p>Disruption to imprinted genes at the H19/Igf2 cluster resulting in the maternal chromosome resembling the paternal chromosome (i.e. H19 inactive &amp; Igf2 active on both maternal &amp; paternal alleles) is problematic. The overdose of Igf2 (oncogene that promotes growth) as a result of its expression form both alleles predisposes to embryonic tumours such as Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic state &amp; DNA methylation are established in sensitive periods &amp; maintained throughout adulthood.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are periods where epigenetic marks are actively established &amp; remodelled (epigenetic reprogramming). Epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs in two waves:</p>
<p>1. Pre-implantation period early development - before germ cell implants &amp; makes placenta (removal of DNA methylation &amp; histone marks a global low around blastocyst stage just before implantation)</p>
<p>2. Primordial germ cell development - removal of somatic marks to produce specific signatures for germ cells</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients with a drug that affects DNA methylation during sensitive periods as during these times, methylation is being established &amp; any changes caused by the drug will be maintained throughout adult life which could have far reaching repercussions.</p>
<p>For example, imprinted genes must be reprogrammed &amp; maintain methylation - this process may be disrupted by using drugs that affect DNA methylaiton. Alterations or removal of the normal process can lead to epigenetic abnormalities, particularly aberrant imprinting, which is associated with conditions such as Angelman syndrome &amp; Prader-Willi Syndrome. Additionally, use of these drugs in pregnant women could have significant effects on the unborn child's DNA methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has been FDA approved for myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) class of enzymatic epigenetic inhibitors.</p>
<p>As a DNMTi, Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMTs once they are incorporated into the DNA. DNMTi is therefore replication dependent. In replication, DNA methyltransferase arrives to bind to the nucleotide in order to copy the methylation onto the daughter strand. DNMT is bound irreversibly &amp; cannot then be released. Since cancer cells replicate at a greater rate than normal cells, Decitabine has a greater effect on tumours than normal tissue.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action for Decitabine is not yet determined, however it is useful against tumours as it inhibits DNMT &amp; therefore DNA methylation at low doses, causing hypomethylation. Some cancers may be dependent upon methylation of CpG islands silencing tumour suppressor genes enabling cancer progression.</p></div>
