    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation at C5 position of cytosine base found in nearly 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides is the epigenetic phenomena that significantly contribute to gene expression.  In normal cells, about 60% of the promoter regions of gene are densely populated with the CpG islands and relatively free of DNA methylation that are independent of gene activity. However, in cancer cells, the promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to silencing of active genes such as tumor suppressor genes leading to cancer. This CpG promoter DNA hypermethylation occurring more frequently than mutations can be attributed as a component of cancer pathogenesis in line with Krudson hypothesis.  The distinct patterns of hypermethlated CpG islands in a set of genes give rise to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP).  Because CIMPs are associated clinically distinct tumors, they make excellent biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and monitoring of cancer.    </p>
<p>In normal cells, genome-wide methylation can be observed in intergenic intervals, repetitive elements or other places resulting in genomic stability.  However, in cancer cells, the intergenic intervals and repetitive elements become hypomethylated to some degree in all tumour types and progress with tumorigenecity. The hypomethylation of intergenic intervals and repetitive elements increase genomic instability resulting in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.  This chromosomal instability appears to enhance tumorgenesis.  Like CIMP, understanding the pattern of DNA methylation (hypomethylation) in intergenic regions and repetitive elements has strong implications for therapy in cancers with patients with epigenetic specificity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the hallmark features of cancer cells is the loss of imprinting. For example, in H19/Igf2 cluster, H19 is methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated in maternal allele.  When H19 cluster is unmethylated on maternal allele, CTCF is insulator element allowing enhancers to act on H19 but keeping IGF2 silent, resulting in no expression.  On paternal allele, the methylation of H19 allows enhancers to act on IGF2 and its expression since CTCF is not binding to insulate enhancers.</p>
<p>When DNA hypermethylation takes place in the imprint control region (both maternal and paternal alleles are DNA methylated), there are double expressions of Igf2 compared to normal cell resulting in Wilm’s tumour, childhood kidney cancer.  The loss of imprinting through hypermethylation or hypomethylation observed often in early tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation have been associated with the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is laid down by DNA methyltransferases. There have been studies reporting for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations may be a risk factor for leukemia progression. (doi:  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3324%2Fhaematol.2011.045559">10.3324/haematol.2011.045559</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  Decitabine is approved to treat a wide variety of myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect in bone marrow after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of methyltransferase in neoplastic cells, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and subsequent cell death.  Non-proliferating cells are comparatively unresponsive to decitabine treatment. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The period of epigenetic reprogramming is a sensitive period.  During the sensitive period of cell development, the epigenetic landscapes needs to remove lineage-specific epigenetic marks, restore pluripotent epigenetic marks, restore open pluripotent chromatic state, retain imprints at Imprint Control Region (ICR) and remove XCI (x chromosome inactivation) for females.  Alterations of the normal process during this epigenetic reprogramming period can impact development. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For cancer cells rapidly replicating and mitotically inheriting abnormal epigenetic marks, DNA demethylation can be targeted for this period and even resulting death of aberrant somatic cells.  However, after pregnancy during early development of embryo and primodial germs cells-sensitive period of development, the normal DNA methylation process is critical in ensuring healthy development of an individual.  It is highly prudent to avoid treating female patients during pregnancy with epigenetic therapy to avoid this sensitive period to minimize disruption of epigenetic reprogramming.  Also in other somatic cells, it would be prudent to keep life cycle of cell lineages and spacing treatments with impacts to epigenetic programming in mind.</p></div>
