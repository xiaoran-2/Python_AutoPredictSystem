    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated. In cancer, the opposite occurs ie CpG islands are hypermethylated and this leads to disease as it occurs in promotors for tumour suppressor genes. In a normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. In cancer, the opposite occurs ie these areas are hypomethylated, more commonly in the repetitive regions. This contributes to disease by causing genomic instability e.g. reciprocal translocation (illegitimate recombination between repeats), deletions, and insertions/transpositions (activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighbouring genes). Hypomethylation at CpG poor promotors is less common than repeat hypomethylation and causes activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes that are imprinted are expressed only from one parental allele. The regulation of gene imprinting occurs at CpG-enriched imrpinting control regions (ICR), a differentally methylated region (DMR) that is variably methylated depending on parent of origin during gonadal develeopment and is involved in gene silencing. The ICR is normally used by the cell as a switch to permanently inactivate transcription allowing mono-allelic expression of the gene. Igf 2, a gene whose end action is to stimulate general growth. The ICR for the Igf2/H19 locus on the maternal allele is unmethylated, while the ICR on the paternal methylated. Methylation of the paternal allele ICR blocks the transcription factor from binding and creating physical barrier that stops downstream enhancers from augmenting Igf 2 promoters. this effectively silences the maternal allele. Disrupted imprinting can results in 2 scenarios: the affected individual either has both alleles dually expressed due to activation of the silent allele or no expression due to suppression of the normally active allele. In Wilms tumour loss of imprinting of igf2 is considered the most common epigenetic aberration.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of small molecules known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. These are nucleoside analogues that irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferase after they are incorporated into DNA. This is replication dependent. The anti-neoplastic effect is a result of DNA demethylation that is in fact not dose dependent. It is often used in the treatment of haematological malignancies such as MDS since they are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation but the exact mechanism of action is unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because the effect is mitotically heritable that is, the effect on the cell is passed onto daughter cells. Sensitive periods are defined as those when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. ie primordial  germ cell development through to gamete, pre-implantation and early post-implantation where active reprogramming of epigenetic marks occurs. Somatic maintenance periods are less sensitive. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because this active reprogramming of epigenetic marks would be hindered and result in altered methylation that is in turn mitotically heritable.</p></div>
