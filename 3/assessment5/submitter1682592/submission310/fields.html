    <h1>Submission 310 from Anon (session_user_id: c47ac94badb44b066b2bf7a28ffa52090ce0c754)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabile is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. </span></p>
<p><span>This drug reduces methylation over promotor genes. Methylation silences genes expression</span></p>
<p><span>Many cancers occur when there is an overmethylation of genes: the right ones and another around. Among these, there could be methylation of tumor supressor genes. Decitabile, as demethylating agent can re-activate expression of tumor supressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic is transmited from the cell to the following generation. Altering methylation of one cell will affect also to the daugther cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when something can affect, so, drugs can act with a high rate of sucess.</p>
<p>In development (growth and division), many proteins are required to achive it. Methylation, acetilation, and main epigenetics processes depend on proteins. Sinthesis of new DNA or checkpoints between G1/S - G2/M, are examples of sensitives periods.</p>
<p>During this period, normal cell has their cell cycle also. Drugs could damage these normal cells if it is applyed with no restriction between cancer and normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Promoters use to have CpG that are free of methylation independent of their activity.</p>
<p>In cancer, promoters CpG island are usually methylated and the activity of the gene represed.</p>
<p>In cancer, these genes silenced by methylation are tumor suppressor genes and other "anticancer" genes.</p>
<p><span>DNA methylaion in intergenic regions might silenced transcription noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing  and relates to replicationi timing.</span></p>
<p>In cancer, alterations patterns are possible due to the loss of fidelity or mutation of epigenetic enzymes, resulting in a loss of the global DNA methylation content</p>
<p>Most repetitive sequences silenced are retroviral insetions and satellite repeats. In cancer these regions lose methylation so they become active and they can skip to another gene intercepting its expression. If it happens to a tumor suppressor gene, cancer would be arise.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Both, paternal and maternal Igf2, is non-DNA-methylated. </span></p>
<p><span>Paternal allele is active and silences the protein gene Igf2 by activation of a methyltransferase that act over H19 promoter.</span></p>
<p><span>Maternal allele is inactive allele but dominant in transmision. <em>H19</em><span> is a maternally expressed non-coding RNA with possible tumour-suppressor functions</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>IC1 hypermethylation is consistently associated with biallelic activation of IGF2 and biallelic silencing of H19. High incidence of Wilm's tumour is related to a mutation in IC1 that allow it be synthesized independtly of its methylation status.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>IGF is an insulin-growth-factor. Its activation by IC1 in Wilm's tumour contributes to cancer by proliferation of cells.</span></span></p></div>
