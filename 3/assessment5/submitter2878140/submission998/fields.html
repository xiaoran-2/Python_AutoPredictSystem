    <div class="field-value"><p>The C-G dinucleotides commonly named CpG islands are located near or in promoters. The Cytosine has the ability to be methylated and when this occurs at promoters, the related genes get silenced; but, in a normal cell, promoters tend to be unmethylated (expressed). In cancer cell occur abnormal methylation; thus, CpG islands at promoters results hypermethylated and the repetitive elements and introns (normally methylated) results unmethylated or hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer, when the CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes gets methylated, this leads to silencing, and like this genes are in charge of decrease proliferation of the cell, this will end up in uncontrollable cell division. Additionally, the activation of oncogenes by hypomethylation of their promoters leads to a continued growth promotion.</p>
<p>The Knudson hypothesis says that multiple hits are needed to cancer occur, because if just one copy of a tumour suppressor gene or an oncogene is failing, that wouldn´t be enough to cause tumours.</p>
<p>By other hand, the introns must been methylated (silenced), the function of them is maintaining genomic integrity, because genomic instability would leads to point mutations, illegitimate recombination, etc. The repetitive elements have the capacity of activate or inactivate the expression of other genes; normally, they can alter the genome sequence and then change the expression of genes, that´s why they must been heavily methylated. In cancer, repetitive elements use to be missexpressed. piRNA have an important role in stem cells and when get damaged, increase the number of transposons and thus, the transcription of wrong fragments .</p>
<p>Some lncRNA like HOTAIR could get overexpressed in some kinds of cancer and this can retarget PRC2 (molecule which lays down H3K27 methylation) so, we obtain an embryonic kind of tissue (with no methylation or hypomethylated).</p>
<p>Quoting Marnie Blewitt: unlike mutations, epimutations are reversible!</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting happen when just one allele of a particular parent is getting express for a specific gene. When the Imprint-Control-Region (ICR) gets methylated, for example, in the maternal allele, it´s maternally imprinted. Here methylation doesn´t mean gene silencing. Methylation lays down during primordial germ cell, where parent-of-origin specific marks get established.</p>
<p>The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is normally unmethylated at the ICR and CTCF protein binds to it. This union insulates the enhancers from Igf2, thus, the enhancers enhance the expression of H19. In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated so, CTCF can´t get bind; by consequence, the enhancers enhance Igf2. The expression of H19 doesn´t occurs because the heterochromatin at the ICR spread to H19 location.</p>
<p>In Wilms-tumour the cluster is maternally imprinted;both alleles are methylated at ICR, thus, CTCF can´t recognize it and then bind, so H19 gets silenced and Igf2 gets enhance, resulting in a doubled expression of Igf2 which leads to Wilms-tumour.</p>
<p>Disruption of Igf2 turned it into an oncogen and disrupt Kcnq1 cluster, leading to silencing a tumour-suppressor gene call cdkn1c; improving the probability of develop tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which inhibits DNMT, an enzyme which establishes methylation. DNMT1 recognize hemimethylated DNA and establish methylation on the synthesized strand. But Decitabine, an analogue of nucleoside, incorporate into the new strand, and when the enzyme DNMT1 comes, it gets bound permanently and can´t be released. When DNMT1 fails, the DNA in the daughter cell will keeps being hemimethylated and methylation will dilute out through cellular division. Cancer cells would be more affected because they replicate more often, than normal cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation helps to silence the expression some genes; whenis present, the chromatin turn into a heterochromatin conformation. This heavily methylated conformation makes transcriptionally inactive the genes inside of it. However, Decitabine capacity able to take off the repression and reestablish their normal expression. So if we could make specific this action to the tumour-suppressor genes, we could restore the cell ability to fight cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs could have an enduring effect because this drugs affects the establishing of epigenetic marks. When these enzymes fail, methylation won´t be established and the acetylation wouldn´t be removed. Azacitidine affect DNMT1 an enzyme which establish methylation on the synthesized strand.This happen before cytokinesis, so the epigenetic mark results mitotically heritable. However, like it´s a replication dependent process, when the DNMT1 fails, the methylation would dilute out passively.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is when environment or diet is able to influence the epigenetic makeup. Here, a exposition could leads to development of disease because is when occur the epigenetic reprogramming. In mammals, there´re two important windows: during early-embryonic development to blastocyst and between primordial germ-cell-development to production of gametes.</p>
<p>Dutch Famine study showed that famine during conceptional period is related to low birth weight at babies and a predisposition to develop diabetes and obesity. Additionally, Överkallix cohort study shows that the food supply of boys (9-12) and girls (8-10) have a strong influence in the grandchildren longevity..</p>
<p>Thus,using those drugs in periods of development like pregnancy and childhood could have a negative effect on the present generation and the followings. </p></div>
