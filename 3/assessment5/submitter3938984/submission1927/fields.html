    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the facts that can cause aberrstions in epigenetic control seen in cancer is DNA methylation. In normal cells, the CpG island are hypomethylated while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cancer cells are more likely to be methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This process is called CpG island hypermethylation and it inactive a tumour suppressor gene. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable this means that this is a good locking down mechanism in terms of epigenetic silencing.</p>
<p>And according to Knualson hypotesis, cancer is the result of multiple hots to DNA and DNA methylation can be considered one of the those hits.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting genes are those genes that should be displaying mono allelic parent-of-origin specific espression, which they no longer show bur rather became expressed for both parental alleles or silent for both parental alleles. The reason for this to occur in cancer is that this gene is responsable for growth ( promoting or repressing ).</p>
<p>In normal cells, on the maternal allele the control region is unmethylated therefore the CTCF binds to it which inhibits the Igf2 and promotes the H19. On the paternal allele, the control region is methylated which makes the enhancers act on the Igf2 .</p>
<p>In cancer cells, bothe the maternal and paternal control regions are methylated which causes a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoting. This type of cancer is called Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that is already on the market, it is a DNA-demethylating agent sold as Dacoger, it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndtome, the precursor of acute myelogenous leykaemia.</p>
<p>It is a DNMT inhibitour that target the epigenetic machinery, it gets incorporated into DNA during replication and when the DNA methyltrasferase cames to bind it, the DNMTi cames along to bind that nucleotide to than copy the methylation tho the daughter strain that DNMTi is bound irreversibly and can no longer be relested.</p>
<p>It means that the DNMTi depend on replication of the cells which mean that cancer cells which are more rapidly  divided will be severely affected because they are replicating more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are some periods of time that these drugs should be avoided they are called sentitive periods ( important periods in development ). The first period is the primordial germ cells and the secound is the pre-implantation and early implantation period which involves the gametes, fertilized eggs, blastocist and epiblast. These are periods of active remodellimg of the epigenome. Therefore young patients should be careful particularly those who have developing germ cells, because it inhibits the epigenetic machinary .</p>
<p>These drugs act on the epigenetic abnormalities, as cancer is not the only disease that causes epigenetic disorders, they can also be used to treat other diseases.</p></div>
