    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a well studied and important epigenetic modification for both growth and maintenence of gene expression. In adult cells, there is typically low methylation in CpG islands, which is necessary as CpG islands are often responsible for regulation of important gene function, as well as higher methylation in deleterious areas such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which prevent genomic instability. However in cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands within regulatory loci is found, resulting in down-regulation of control elements such as tumour suppressor genes. As down-regulation of genes are the typical effect of methylation, loss of regulatory control in these areas are a contributing factor to the causation of cancer, for example BRCA1/2 in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements is also found globally in cancer genes causing genomic instability, for example repetitive elements can translocate and insert, delete or translocate themselves in random sequences which can result in mutations to critical regulatory genes, such as deletion of DNMT3B as found in ICF syndrome. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions can also result in activation of cryptic or unneeded promoters that may interfere with the actual function of a gene. Activation of cPg poor promoters via hypomethylation, although rare can activate tumourgenic genes which can cause cancer, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. <br /><br />It should be noted that genomic instability or suppression of genes are one of multiple 'hits' required to completely lose regulatory function and cause cancer according to the Knudson hypothesis, so one modification is usually not the sole cause of a disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA de-methylating epigenetic inhibitors, which demethylates DNA that has been inappropriately methylated by an overactive methylating or histone modifying gene. This allows a gene to be reactivated if it has been inappropriately suppressed and blocked from being used for transcription. This can be critical if the gene of interest is a tumour suppressor gene, or otherwise a gene that plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. If it is suppressed, a tumour may be able to bypass other regulations and form a cancer. De-methylation in this case would then have an anti-tumour effect, provided it is targeted to the right gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the more controversial aspects of epigenetics is that epigenetic marks can be transgenerational, ie the marks accumulated in the life of an organism can be passed on to offspring via imprinting. A sensitive period (from an epigenetic perspective) is a point during development where the formation and establishment of epigenetic markers is occuring, and so the epigenome is highly sensitive to and influenced by environmental factors. The main sensitive periods during development are early embryo formation following conception, the formation of primordial germ cells and alternatively through artificial reprogramming in somatic cells. Treating patients with epigenetically modifying drugs in a sensitive period is then inadvisable, because the modifications may have a much more unknown and therefore dangerous effect. For example, treating with a methylating drug during this time may result in suppression of a gene that is critical during development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal expression of a paternal allele, the H19 region is methylated, repressing its activity, which prevents the activation of the CTCF enhancers downstream, which would normally activate CTCF to block the transcription of the Igf2 gene cluster. In the maternal allele however, the H19 region is not methylated, which means that it activates the CTCF enhancers, activating CTCF to block the transcription site of Igf2 gene, therefore it is not expressed from the maternal allele. So in combination of both alleles, only one allele (the paternal) is being expressed, which is a normal dose for a cell. But if the H19 site on the maternal allele is unintentionally hypermethylated, it blocks activation of the CTCF enhancers and hence Igf2 is expressed on the maternal allele as well, resulting in an overexpression or double dose of the Igf2 gene, such as what is found in Wilm's tumour. As this is a growth promoting gene, overexpression leads to overgrowth of normal tissue into neoplastic tissue, ie a tumour.</p></div>
