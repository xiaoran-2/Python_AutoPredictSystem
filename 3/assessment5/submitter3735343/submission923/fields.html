    <div class="field-value"><p><br />To describe how the  DNA methylation is altered in cáncer, we need to make it dividing the two principal regions where this process is observed: CpG islands and Intergenic, and Repetitive Elements.</p>
<p><strong>CpG islands</strong><br />CpG islands are regions that contains high frequency of CpG which commonly works as gen promoters;  the function of DNA Methylation at CpG island is to protect the genome, since has been demonstrated that DNA methylation is mutagenic, allowing to prevents transposition and transcriptional interference.<br />In cancer, we can find two kinds of modifications of methylation in CpG islands:</p>
<ul><li>Hypermethylation:</li>
</ul><p>Compared to normal cells, most of carcinogenic cells show an increased proportion of methylation at CpG islands. This is observed on the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which is considered one of the hits of Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<ul><li>CpG poor promoter hypomethylation:</li>
</ul><p>Less common than hypermethylation, hypomethylation of  CpG poor promoters activates the expression of associated genes related to cáncer, provoking the expression of genes as R-Ras and miR21, which are related with gastric cancer and glioma, respectively.<br /><br /><strong>Intergenic and Repetitive Elements</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In spite that DNA Methylation isn’t silencing the gene expression, it mantains the genome integrity, because the cells without Dnmt1 shows genomic instability (deletions, insertion, translocations). Furthermore, it works silencing "cryptic transcriptions starts sites" and "cryptic splicing sites". <br />In cancer, a common trait is to find the intergenic regions and repetitive elements unmethylated. That means that whole genome in cancer cells tend to be hypomethylated. This hypomethylation provokes instability in the genome, which carries to: illegitimate recombinantion between repeats, and the activation of cryptic promoters or the disruption of neighbouring genes. This entails transcriptomal aberrantion, contributing to disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cluster H19/Igf2 shows an imprinting mechanism based in the blocking of enhancers. The enhancers, present in both maternal and paternal alleles, are governed by a CTCF –dependent insulator, which acts as Imprinted Control Region (ICR). The ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, but methylated in the paternal allele. Thus, in the maternal allele, the CTCF protein is able to bind to ICR, isolating Igf2 from the enhancers at the H19 side of insulator, so blocking Igf2 expression. On the contrary, in the paternal allele, ICR methylation stops CTCF binding, allowing to Igf2 engage the enhancers and silencing the H19 expression.</p>
<p>The disruptions of the imprinting mechanism are know as Lost of Imprinting (LOI). In some cases, when LOI is observed in H19/Igf2 cluster, the methylation pattern of the maternal allele change suffering hypermethylation, so the ICR works as in the paternal allele, turning off H19 promoter and turning on IGF2.</p>
<p>The biallelic expression of Igf2 causes an increase of its expression. Igf2 is a mitogen normally expressed during the proliferative stage of kidney development. In this case, the LOI of H19/Igf2 clusters provoke the failure of proliferation arrest, entailing the tumours developing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an azanucleoside, analogue of cytosine, which works as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. For this, Decitabine must be metabolized to 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, then it will be used as substrate by the replication machinery which integrates to DNA. Once there, the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) recognizes it as a natural substrate and initiates the methylation process. Then, azacytosine – guanine dinucleotide will work as a snare, which captures DNMT by covalent bonds, blocking its functions; the chemical adduction suffered by DNMT trigger the DNA damage signalling, resulting in the DNMT degradation. So the DNA methylation marks will be lost during replication. <br />As we know, hypermethylation of CpG islands on promoters of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) entails silencing, which is one of the hits in the carcer. However, the use of Decitabine could restore the gene function by demethylation of those CpG islands, reactivating the cellular anti-tumour mechanism. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation could have enduring effects because the cell has a mechanism based in the DNMT1, which maintains the methylation through the mitosis. However, is during the sensitive periods, where the DNA methylation has the most enduring effects. The sensitive periods make reference to the embryonic developing stages where the cells delete the epigenetics marks and reprogram the information.  This process is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and occurs during the pre-implantation development and the germ cell development. Treat patients during developing periods is inadvisable because you will be risking all the developing process of the embryon, causing abortion or serious epigenomic code aberrations.</p>
<p>DNA methylation drugs would have lasting effects, beyond the period of drug treatment, because once you have caused changes in the methylation pattern, those patterns would be extending through the mitosis using DNMT1 mechanism, which is responsible of the heritable characteristic of DNA methylation.</p></div>
