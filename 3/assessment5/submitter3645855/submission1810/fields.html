    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark which decreases gene expression in hypermethylated promoter regions, and increases expression in hypomethylated regions. However, CpG islands (which are found in high concentrations in these promoter regions) are normally kept free of methylation, whether their activity state is expressed or silenced.</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, producing silencing of the underlying gene. For example, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the <em>RB</em> gene in retinoblastoma.</li>
<li>This could contribute to disease if the underlying gene is, for example, a tumour suppressor gene.</li>
<li>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Here, genomic stability is maintained</li>
<li>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Here, illegitimate recombination occurs between repeats, due to abnormal reciprocal translocations between chromosomes because of the presence of euchromatin and genetic similarity. Hypomethylation can also activate repeats and transposition, resulting in activation of neighboring genes, and interruption of genes where the new repeat copies are located. Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes also occurs.</li>
<li>The outcomes of hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are gene deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations, leading to genomic instability and an abnormal karyotype, such as in ICF syndrome, where mutations in<em> DNMT3B</em> lead to genomic instability.</li>
</ul><div> </div>
<ul><li>A CpG with an insufficient density of CpGs to be considered a CpG island is considered a CpG poor promoter, and hypomethylation of these regions lead to activation of certain genes that produce cancer such as <em>R-RAS</em> in gastric cancer.</li>
<li>Genome-wide, hypomethylation occurs, with localized hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes. The functional outcome of DNA methylation depends on whether the tumour is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation or chromosomal instability, where depletion of DNA methylation suppresses or enhances tumorigenesis, respectively.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that belongs to the DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitor class of epigenetic inhibitors. </li>
<li>The drug is composed of nucleoside analogues that get incorporated into the DNA where it irreversibly binds to DNMTs, inhibiting methylation, and is therefore replication dependent. This means that cancer cells, which divide more rapidly than other cells in the body, are more severely affected.</li>
<li>It can have an anti-tumour effect because it reverts the hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands found in cancer cells, which silence the underlying gene (such as tumour suppressor genes). This drug is FDA approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML. Decitabine's specific effect in hematological malignancies is due to the fact that these diseases are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated on the paternal allele, so CTCF doesn't bind and insulate the ICR. The enhancers then act on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed.</li>
<li>The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, so CTCF (an insulator) will bind to the ICR. Enhancers will then act on H19, and Igf2 will be silent and so will not be expressed.</li>
<li>Will loss of imprinting, which occurs in Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation occurs on the ICR in the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, which then expresses Igf2 in addition to the Igf2 expresed on the paternal allele. Igf2 is growth promoting, and is associated with the Wilm's kidney tumour.</li>
<li>Loss of imprinting is an early event, and occurs in pre-neoplastic tissues. Hyper/hypomethylation in Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) such as the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to loss of imprinting. Genes that present disruption of imprinting either express both parental alleles or silence both parental alleles; this is involved in cancer because the genes that present loss of imprinting are usually growth-supressing or growth-promoting.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can continue to have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment, and leave enduring effects on the epigenome, due to the fact that the epigenetic changes that occur are mytotically heritable in the cell lineage.</li>
<li>A sensitive period of development includes the stages where the epigenetic modifications in the genome are removed to ensure totipotency.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods include the stages of germ cell development and during early embrionic development.</li>
<li>Treating patients during these periods (young patients in reproductive age, pregnant patients) is inadvisable because the possible mutations in germ cells could lead to potentially devastating birth defects or unknown symptoms caused by epigenetic alterations.</li>
