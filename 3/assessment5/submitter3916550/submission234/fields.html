    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation at CpG islands is normally regulated because CpG islands are normally associated with genes promoters so, there is an epigenetic control of gene expression. In cancer, methylation pattern is altered due incorrect activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) causing DNA methylation shows higher levels than we would expect, meaning that many genes that should be expressed are now silenced. These genes could be tumor suppressors being one hit to develop the disease. At intergenic regions and repetitive elements, methylation patterns are different from CpG islands. These regions are normally hypermethylated in a normal cell because repetitive elements are associated to centromeric regions, so methylation allows genomic stability, additionally, methylations at these regions inactivates transposons and also prevent recombination events that may lead to chromosome alterations. In cancer, these regions show lower levels of methylation than a normal cell because incorrect activity of DNMT or lower expression of these proteins. The hypomethylation consequence depends on the location. It is most common in repeats so this allows illegitimate recombination events, genomic instability, activation of transposons and activation of cryptic promoters.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The H19/Igf2 cluster in the paternal allele is methylated the ICR so the CTCF protein is not allowed to join, so enhancers reach the Igf2 gene allowing its expression and inhibiting the H19 gene. On the maternal allele, the ICF is not methylated and the CTCF protein binds in it. This makes the enhancers reach the H19 gene and silencing the Igf2 gene. This cluster is disrupted in cancer due to hypermethylation in both alleles so Igf2 is overexpressed. This is associated with Wilm’s tumour.  This disruption of the H19/Igf2 cluster is observed in pre-neoplastic tissues due to the overexpression of the Igf2 protein.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor so, this epigenetic drug is already in the market and is used for myelodysplastic syndromes (Precursor of leukaemia). According to NCBI, decitabine is a cytidine analog which covalently binds the DNA methyltransferase inhibiting it. This effect is replication dependent so the effect will be higher in cells which are in constantly cell division such as cancer cells. Decitabine causes hypomethylation in the DNA and has an anti-tumour effect because according to NCBI due to the hypomethylation many regions are epigenetically reactivated. These regions are normally tumor suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because as we saw in the course, epigenetics are mitotically heritable so, changes in DNA methylation will be passed to the rest of the cells. If these drugs alter DNA methylation in some way that it causes a normal arrangement of methylation pattern and because of this genomic stability, mutations in cancer will stop and it will be easier for repair machinery to access DNA that may be hypermethylated in some regions. A sensitive period is a time when there is an epigenetic reprogramming these periods are during the pre-implantation development and the primordial germ cell development. Any patient treated with drugs at these periods would have inadvisable effects because methylation pattern are erased an re-established at these periods.</span></p></div>
