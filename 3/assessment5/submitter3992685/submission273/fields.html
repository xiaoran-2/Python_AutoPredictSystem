    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of  DNA methylation at  CpG islands is to silence  genes at their promoter regions. In cancer CpG islands are hypermetylated in the promoter area of the gene and hypomethylated in the intergenic areas and at repetitive elements. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease by turning tumor suppressor genes off. When these genes are switched off there is uncontrolled cellular growth which results in cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation at intergenic intervals and repetitive elements is to be hypermethylated to maintain genomic stability. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated, thereby causing genomic instability by way of  chromosomal aberrant deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. This then leads to genetic mistakes that can result in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 gene cluster is paternally imprinted and methtylated.This prevents the binding of  the CTCF insulator and enhancers are free to act on Igf2 to promote it’s expression. Methylation of the paternal control region then spreads downstream into the H19 promoter region and silences it.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the imprint control region is unmethylated and can then be bound by the insulator protein CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers which are now free to act upon H19 and enhance it’s expression.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the maternal ICR H19/Igf2 cluster blocks CTCF insulator protein from binding which allows  DNA methylation of the ICR which spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it allowing the enhancers  to access and activate Igf2. The maternal allele then behaves  like a paternal allele and this condition is called paternal disomy.  In Wilm’s disease the loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster causes an overexpression of the growth promoting gene Igf2  causing the growth of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic compounds called small molecule inhibitors. These types of drugs target the enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Decitabine specifically functions by  the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. It therefore prevents DNMT from methylating CPG islands in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes and allows the DNA to remain hypomethylated. This allows for the expression of those tumor suppressor genes which could have been switched off by methylation.  This in turn prevents tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by way of mitotic heritability of methylation marks through the action of DNMT which recognizes a hemimethylated daughter strand of DNA after cell division and maintains the original methylated state in the new cell. Sensitive periods  in development area periods  in time where the chromosomes are stripped of their methylated epigenetic marks and then re-established by DNMT. At these times environmental conditions can potentially influence epigenetic control. In mammals these periods are from primordial germ cell development to gametes and from pre-implantation to early post implantation. This is because at these times the epigenome is involved in active remodeling. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because these are the times when removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome are taking place and these are the times of greatest sensitivity to the environment. In pregnant women this is especially true since any insult could interfere with the normal development of the embryo.</p></div>
