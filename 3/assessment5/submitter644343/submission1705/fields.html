    <div class="field-value"><p>CGI's (CpG islands) are short (about 1000 bps) DNA sequences that are very different from normal DNA sequences in that they are GC-rich, CpG rich and are largely nonmethylated.</p>
<p>CGI sites are commonly associated with promoter activity. DNA methylation in the promoter region of a gene is generally associated with gene silencing, and reduced methylation is associated with gene expression. </p>
<p>Many cancers are associated with changes in the methylation patterns of CGIs.</p>
<p>One mechanism by which CGI methylation may be involved in cancer is where methylation of a CGI region associated with a tumour suppressor gene leads to a silencing of that gene, and hence the development of cancer. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. CpGs in these regions are not so common. This may be the result of selective pressure because DNA methylation has a mutagenic effect as methylated Cytosine can undergo deamination into Thymine.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions may function by silencing cryptic (hidden) transcription start sites and,also, cryptic splice sites.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of repetitive elements may silence mutagenic transpositions, and mutation occurring in methylated repeats may silence propagation of those repeats. </p>
<p>The Genome defense model hypothesis postulates that DNA methylation may protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats may play a role in cancer by increasing the level of genomic instability. </p>
<p>In higher organisms a balance needs to be struck between the benefits of DNA methylation and the mutagenic effect of DNA methylation .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> <span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The IGF2 and H19 genes are located in the telomeric cluster of chromosome 11p15.5.  This cluster contains an imprinting control region (ICR) which controls the expression of the neighbouring genes. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The ICR is normally methylated on the paternal allele.  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The maternal allele is normally not methylated - this is referred to as maternal IGF2 imprinting. This allows the binding of the transcriptional repressor CTCF to an insulator element located in this region. This blocks the access of the IGF2 promoters to enhancers which are located on the downstream side of the H19 gene. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">This blockage will not be present in the paternal gene. IGF2 promoters can access the enhancers on the paternal gene and IGF2 expression on this gene will not be blocked. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">A large percentage of Wilms tumors are associated with duplication of paternal </span></span></span><em><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">IGF2</span></span></span></em><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"> or loss of maternal </span></span></span><em><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">IGF2</span></span></span></em><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;"> imprinting. This will result in over-expression of IGF2 (an Insulin Like Growth Factor) which may result in tumour development.  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The genetics of Wilms disease also involves the WT1 gene (the WT1 gene product appears to act as a tumour suppressor gene.), and may also involve elevated phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 . </span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-size:small;">Decitabine is an epigenetic drug</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-size:small;">It acts as a DNA demthylating agent by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-size:small;">A possible mechanism of its anti-tumour action is via the reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes by reducing the level of methylation of promoter regions associated with these genes. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-size:small;">Dicetabine is also an antimetabolite (i.e. it can be incorporated into DNA) and so it may function via its incorporation into DNA leading to disruption of the DNA structure which might result in cell death. </span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>In somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity i.e the epigenetic pattern is persistent. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>Sensitive periods, in epigenetics, are where the DNA methylation pattern undergoes extensive changes. <br /></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>In the case of epigenetics two key sensitive periods are </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>1. The period during formation of the primordial germ cells in the developing foetus - which is associated with the creation of sex specific epigenetic imprint patterns</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>2.  The period just after fertilisation in the early zygote. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span>These critical periods are associated with a period of extensive DNA demythylation followed by a subsequent period of DNA methylation. The extent and location of DNA methylation is important – the right amount in the right places ( e.g. very low levels of methylation at some sites and not others). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1a1818;"><span style="font-size:small;">The level of DNA methylation can be affected by the availability of Methyl donors and by the presence of demethylating agents. The presence of increased levels of methyl donors may result in reduced demethylation during the demethylation phase and in excessive methylation during the remethylation phase. Conversely the taking of demethylating agents may result in excessive demethylation during the demethylation phase and reduced methylation during the remethylation phase. <br /></span></span></span></p></div>
