    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer is altered through Hypermethylation or Hypomethylation of CpG Islands, Intergenic Regions and Repetitive elements. Hypomethylation of CpG poor Promoters can activate oncogenes.Intergenic Regions and Repetitive Elements are normally methylated in normal cells there by decreasing the chances of recombination, deletion , insertion and mutation.In Cancer cells these normally methylated regions are disrupted there by causing genome wide instability and chromosomal abbrevation..Disruption in DNA Methylation can lead to activtion of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells alter Imprint Control Regions(ICR) genes.  The Maternal Igf2 is not expressed is  therefore silenced through methylation. In Paternal Allele the Igf2 gene is accessable for enhancers to act upon as the CTCF and H19  is actively methylated. In normal Maternal allele the CTCF blocks the enhancers to reach Igf2 gene and H19 is activated as  methylation is inactive in this cluster. In  Wilm's Tumour, the maternal allele Igf2 gene is activated by methylating CTCF and H19. So instead of just paternal allel of Igf2 to be ecpressed now both paternal and maternal allele is expressed due to disruptions in Imprinting process through methylation leading to overexpression of Igf2 gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>FDA approved certain types of enzymatic inhibitor drugs that affect epigenetic processes.Decitabine belongs to DNMT class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine can bind itself to DNA during replication. It is then mitotically heritable as long as cell divides. Therefore it is division dependent. As cancer cells divide rapidly the drug can inhibit the growth rate of such tumors. The drug has been found effective in Myelodysplastic syndrome leading to cutaneous Mylenoma.Decitabine can inhibit the tumour growth by methylating the DNA and then passing on to the Daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic Alterations are reversible. Epigenetic Drugs can be used incombination with other epigenetic drugs or with standard chemotherapy to treat the tumour. DNA methylation when used in large quantities didnt had major effect on the cancer cells but when used in small proportions had significant effect by altering the tumour cells ability to resist drug treatment. Some of the patients showed better response to chemotherapy after being treated with epigenetic drugs. Thus epigenetic drugs like EZH inhibitor which is an alteration to H3k27me can alter the cells epigenetic makeup and maintain such state for the whole life.In Epigenetic terms sensitive period is during gametogenesis. The sensitive period of development are Early embroynic development and primodial germ cells during gastrulation period. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during such sensitive periods can permanently alter the epigenetic makeup and thus will be mitotically heritable. Therefore it is inadvisable t treat patients with such drugs during such sensitive periods. </p></div>
