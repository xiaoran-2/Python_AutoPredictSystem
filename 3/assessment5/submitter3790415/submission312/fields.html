    <div class="field-value">[I only used the required resources and the video lectures &amp; I use this symbol (-) to explain each point required in questions]
As we learned DNA methylation generally takes a specific path in genome for instance we can see in genome in normal cells that (-)CpG islands aren't likely to be methylated &amp; DNA methylation is basically adding a methyl group to DNA which is very important in turning on/off the gene so methylation of CpG islands is almost universally synonymous with silencing of gene expression .So DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark(-)now In cancer we have 4 stages of the tissues(normal tissue,hyperplasia,neoplasia &amp; the invasion) so the global level of methylation start to decrease with each stage &amp; the CpG islands methylation rises while the stages progressing(-)So DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark &amp; the CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and the suppressors are the genes that would normally be able to make the cell die or decrease the proliferation So by activating oncogenes &amp; inactivating tumor suppressors, in combination this results in cancer(-)in intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA methylation maintain genomic integrity [silencing of repeats to prevent transposition-mutation of the repeats(meC to T) to prevent transposition - avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters-methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination] &amp; genome defense model (protect the genome from transposable elements)(-)so in cancer hypomethylation happend to repeats/intergenic interval which cause genomic instability(-)driven by chromosomal instability then depletion of DNA methylation enhance tumorgensis</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">decitabine is a drug sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company its (-)identified as a DNMTi which mean it work against DNA methyltransferase so its a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is used in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to cute myeloid leukemia or AML.(-)it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication then when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly &amp; it can'nt be released.(-)generally it's possible that it's very effective in myelodysplastic syndrome because it might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. And we know that CpG island hypermethylation heavy CpG island hypermethylation has a poor prognostic outcome for myelodysplastic syndrome</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>(-)CTCF is an insulator protine insulates lgf2 from downstream enhansors so DNA methylation blocks binding of CTCF binding .on the paternal allele the ICR methylated so CTCF can't bind so without the CTCF,DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence &amp; enhancers can access lgf3 to activate from the paternal allele so only the paternal allele can promote experssion of lgf2(-)when ICR is unmethylated as a maternal allele It's bound by a CTCF protein which is an insulator protein so its able to insulate CTCF's binding &amp; insulate Igf2 from the downstrem enhancers.(-)in upregulation of lgf2 which is an oncogene &amp; a growth promoting so if we've no Cdkn1c expression &amp; up regulation of lgf2 we'll growth promoting &amp; they display both fetal, and post-natal overgrowth &amp; this is related to the expression of these two genes although others as well.They also display macroglossia, or a large tongue. it have predisposed Wilms tumor(-)So this loss of imprinting &amp; overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of those geno suppress genes because of the loss of imprinting is actually a common feature not just effect with wiedemann syndrome patients. But in general in cancer &amp; so many imprinted genes are involved in controlling growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>life circuit could divide into many stages so when facing mistakes in any of this stages we get abnormals in developments that may extenend to the next stage such as cancer so altering DNA methylation in genome parts will effect expression of genome. generally by altering genome that will cause to inactivate the tumor suprresors &amp; it also effect the genomic instability &amp; deregulation of tissue specific &amp; imprinted genes that controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair .by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands . Interestingly, no global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome.so we divide the life circuit to: zygote,preimplantation embryo,postimplantation embryo,midgestation embryo.blood cell development &amp; the ege-sperm stage. now in cancer we need to pay attention to those stages sepcially midgestation &amp; blood cell development .germ cell tumors found in ovary so if oocyte generate tumor which got ability to make many different types when fertilized so tumor derived from these cells can have many different cell types in there as well now treat it in the sensetive times won't be helpfull because DNA methylation is mitotically heretable  &amp; epigenetic marks will be removed after the egg-sperm stage so we see cancer spread to next stages after the treated stage </p></div>
