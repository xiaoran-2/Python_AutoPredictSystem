    <h1>Submission 1726 from Anon (session_user_id: b61a62fd686c2de3b83810be12cef398460fbcca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents, it means that it’s a drug able to demethylate DNA. This drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This demethylating effect can release a methylated area which is responsible of the tumor genesis by (for example) blocking the activity of a tumor suppressor gen. In this way, the demethylating effect of Decitabine could be release this tumor suppressor activity and reduce the tumor replication.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are periods in early development or in pregnant women when the epigenetic drugs could affect a large amount of cells and these effects in the DNA methylation could lead to incorrect expression of important genes. These epigenetic alterations can be heritable to daughter cells, having enduring effects within the organism. The sensitive period would be the period of development of the individual or the gametogenesis, the early development of the embryo in the pregnant woman and the differentiation of germ line cells, oocytes and sperm. The treatment of the pregnant woman could affect the development of the embryo, the epigenetic drugs could disable the regulation of the DNA methylation necessary to the correct development of the embryo, or make an anomaly blastocyst from the germ cells of people treated with these drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal (non tumoral) cells, the CpG islands are free of methylation, but in cancer cells this CpG islands are hyper-methylated and thereby the genic expression of tumor suppressor genes is reduced or silenced, leading to the de-regulation of the normal development or growth of the cells and the proliferation of tumor cells. In the intragenic regions of the DNA, the repetitive elements (such LINEs and SINEs) are methylated in normal cells, but they are hypo-methylated in cancer cells, leading to genomic instability. The intergenic regions coding RNAs, can interact with chromatine, changing important complex of cells needed to differentiation and shows aberrant expression in some cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In non tumoral cells, the paternal allele of Igf2 is unmethylated, it means, is expressed. In the maternal allele of Igf2 is methylated, it means, is not expressed. H19/Igf2 in Wilm’s tumour both paternal Igf2 remains unmethylated but the maternal allele changes from methylated to unmethylated, turning on the maternal allele; in the H19 allele, the paternal allele remains methylated, but the maternal allele, that was unmethylated before, is methylated, so H19 is turned off. These epigenetics changes, increases the proliferation of cell growth, changing the normal cells to tumoral cells.</p></div>
