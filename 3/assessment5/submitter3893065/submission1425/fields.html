    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays an important role in the proper regulation of gene transcription and expression in normal cells. This chemical modification of cytosine rings by covalent addition of a methyl group that generally occurs within CpG islands, are also found to be involved with histone modifications that changes chromatin structure, thereby ensuring proper regulation of genomic function. Aberrant regulation of DNA methylation has been implicated in cancer. Whereas CpG islands are usually and normally free of methylation, hypermethylation within the promoter regions in CpG islands have been observed to cause repression or inactivation of tumor-suppresor gene function as well as silencing of other genes which lead to cancer progression and progression of other diseases related to the silenced gene, respectively. In normal cases, certain regions of the genome are in fact usually methylated. These are the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. DNA methylation at intergenic regions is believed to occur in order to maintain genomic stability as inferred from the apparent genomic instability of cells without dnmt1 (a DNA methyltransferase). Such genomic instability can cause chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, translocations and insertions between chromosomes. DNA methylation on repetitive elements also appears to contribute to maintenance of genomic stability and integrity. Methylation of long terminal repeats, which have strong promoters, results to silencing of these repeats and prevent mutagenic transpositions, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and perhaps prevent unwanted recombinations. Cleary, aberrant regulation of DNA methylation on these repetitive elements can bring about compromised genomic integrity and instability paving the way for disease progression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation allows for genetic imprinting which results into parent-of-origin gene expression. In the H19/IgF2 cluster of imprinted genes, the DNA methylation is on the paternal allelle while the maternal allelle is unmethylated. In the maternal allelle, an insulator CTCF protein binds to unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) and insulates IgF2 from the enhancers downstream, which allows for the interaction between the enhancer and H19 long non-coding region and resuklt into its eventual expression. On the other hand, a methylated ICR on the paternal allelle prevents CTCF binding and allows for the downstream enhancers to act on the IgF2 promoter and result into IgF2 expression. Moreover, H19 is not expressed on the paternal allelle due to DNA methylation spreading to H19 and silencing its expression. Overexpression of IgF2 is observed as a characteristic feature in Wilm's tumor. Biallellic expression of IgF2 has been described in association with loss of methylation at differentially methylated regions (DMR) of IgF2 as well as loss-of-heterozygosity. Disruption of H19/IgF2 cluster imprinting by either hyper or hypomethylation at the ICR may result in reciprocal changes in H19-IgF2 expression and contribute to disease progression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) inhibitor that exerts its anti-tumor activity by inhibiting the transfer of methyl groups facilitated by Dnmt on CpG islands which would have resulted to gene silencing. It is believed that its direct incorporation to DNA and Dnmt inhibition causes DNA hypomethylation and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Hypomethylation induced by this drug has been shown to induce normal function of genes that are important in cellular differentiation and proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that the environment can influence epigenetic control and there are stages in mammalian cell development that are highly susceptible to epigenetic changes as a result of environmental factors. The periods that are sensitive for epigenetic control are those that are involved in the active remodelling of the genome, namely, primordial germ cell development to mature egg and sperm production and the pre- and post-implantation periods. DNA methylation patterns that occur during the course of cellular development, and consequently diseases associated with such methylations, can be passed on several generations. It is conceivable then that drugs that prevent DNA methylation can exert lasting effect on the epigenome in the context of the prevention of disease passage to the next generation. However, epigenetic drugs can also result into the negative impact of drug-induced heritable epigenetic changes when administered at periods of sensitivity mainly due to the fact that these chemicals can also bring about methylation disruptions in genetic locales that shouldn't otherwise have been disrupted. It is therefore not advisable to administer drugs during these sensitive periods of development, particularly during rapid fetal development. </p></div>
