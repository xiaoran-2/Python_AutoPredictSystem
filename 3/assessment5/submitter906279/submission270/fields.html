    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Imprinting, is associated with DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). Imprinting is critical for embryo viability and changes to DNA methylation at ICRs, resulting in loss of imprinting, contribute to diseases like Beckworth-Wiedman Syndrome and cancer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">For example, in the H19/Igf2 cluster of normal cells, the maternal ICR is unmethylated and bound by CTCF, isolating Igf2 from downstream enhancers, which activate H19 instead. Conversely, the paternal ICR is methylated, precluding CTCF binding. The promoter of H19, then, becomes methylated as well, silencing the H19, and the enhancers activate on Igf2 instead.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Because Igf2 is an oncogene and growth promoter, loss of imprinting in this cluster can result in cancer. Specifically, in Wilm's tumor, Igf2 is overexpressed because both the maternal and paternal sequence are methylated at the ICR and therefore, both Igf2 alleles are expressed. This is also seen in Beckworth-Wideman Syndrome (BWS). Here, imprinting is disrupted and maternal expression mimics paternal expression as in Wilm's. However, BWS is compounded by downregulation of Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressor, which is paternally silenced, but normally expressed maternally. This creates an environment favorable to cancer through tumor growth in the absence of a  mitigating tumor suppressor. Subsequently, one symptom of BWS includes Wilm's tumor.<br /></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator that acts as a DNA demethylator by inhibiting  DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are responsible for de novo or maintanence of DNA methylation. By permanantly binding to and inhibiting DNMTs,  every cell division results in passive DNA demethylation. Because cancer cells have a more rapid replication rate, they experience DNA methylation at a higher rate as well. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Because Decitabine is non-specific with regard to target cells, it's effects are context-dependent.  Where the tumor is a consequence of hypermethylation, Decitabine is an effective mediator, including CPG islands and shores at tumor suppressor genes, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation, and inappropriately methylated ICRs that cause a loss of imprinting. With the removal of methylation at these sites, the relevant genes, for a example a tumor suppressor gene, are are activated to resume their anti-tumor function. However, Decitabine can act to promote tumor growth when acting on cells that are experiencing genomic instability due to genome-wide hypomethylation, for example.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>        DNA methylation is a stable, epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. Subsequently, changes to DNA methylation will persist in daughter cells until they are reset.. Therefore, drugs that can eliminate the cancer-inducing epigenetic marks correct not only the original target cell, but resulting daughter cells as well, sustaining their therapeutic impact indefinitely.</p>
<p> Outside of epigenetic aberations and designer “epidrugs,” epigenetic marks are reset during epigenetic reprogramming. This period is considered a “sensitive period”, wherin the epigenetic marks of a somatic cell are removed to restore totipotency of a cell for reproduction, including DNA methylation. This occurs twice: once at pre-implantation embryo development (ED) between the zygote and blastocyst stage, and also in the establishment of primordial germ cells (PGCs). During these periods, environmental factors like epigenetic drugs can induce changes that will be mitotically heritable for the life of the organism (ED) or the life of the subsequent generation (PGCs), including potentially disruptive changes. Subsequently, treating pregnant women and children with epigenetic drugs is imprudent because the alterations they establish may be unfavorable, are relatively permanent, and have a ripple effect on the subsequent differentiating cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at these CpG islands is a mechanism for gene silencing. This is accomplished through the formation of repressive chromatin structures that can condense the chromatin and limit the ability of transcription factors to bind and express methylated genes. These marks are then inherited mitotically and maintained via the enzyme DMNT1. In normal cells, the CpG islands are located at gene promoters, including those for tumor supressor genes, and usually remain unmethylated.</p>
<p> In cancer cells, CpG islands and their shores may be hypermethylated at tumor suppressor genes, which silences them. In addition to allowing the originally aberrant cell(s) to replicate at an accelerated rate without the mitigating growth management, these changes are inherited by daughter cells which can then replicate an at an accelerated rate as well, resulting in a tumor.</p>
<p> DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genomic stability by silencing destructive elements, including transpoosons and cryptic start and splice sites, that interfere with normal recombination and transcription.</p>
<p> In cancer, DNA is hypomethylated at these sites, and the expression of these destructive elements is permitted. Inappropriately expressed repeats can cause chromosomal and gene mutations, through erroneous recombination, that disrupt not only normal cell cycle function, yielding cancer, but other disorders as well. Further, expression at cryptic promoters can disrupt the normal expression of neighboring genes by opening them to transcription where they would otherwise be silenced. Expression of repeats can also produce an overabundance of encoded proteins and hypomethylated transpoosons may insinuate themselves into other genes, corrupting their transcription.</p>
<p> When these disrupted patterns activate oncogenes that encourage tumor growth, or minimize the expression of tumor suppressor genes, cancer develops because the cells undergo mitosis at an accelerated rate and daughter cells inherit the tumor-promoting epigenetic marks.</p></div>
