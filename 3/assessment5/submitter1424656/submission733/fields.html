    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect if the tumor is caused by hypermethylation. Hypermethylation is an unusual boost in epigenetic methylation, which silent genes in and surrounding the site of methlyation including tumor suppressive genes that regulate and stop cell from growing uncontrollably. If tumor suppressive genes are silenced, it can lead to the growth of tumor. Decitabine demethylates repressor binding site, in other words, inhibiting DNA methlyation. As a result, the tumor-suppressive genes become unmethylated and are now capable of resuming their normal job - inhibit the growth of tumor. In another word,  Decitabine reverses the effect of a previous methylation caused by a mutation, and reactivates the tumor-suppressive genes, giving an anti-tumor effect. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Under normal condition, CPG islands are mostly unmethylated. Methylating a CPG island would lead to the silencing of gene expression because gene promoters reside in CPGs islands. Therefore, to keep genes active, especially tumor suppressive genes, DNA must not be methylated at CPG islands. In cancer, CPG islands are hypermethlated – having too much methylation. As a result, genes at CPG islands, including tumor suppressive genes are silenced. When tumor suppressive genes are silenced, cells can grow uncontrollably, leading to the formation of tumor and, in malignant cases, cancer. Another important to note is that CPG island hypermethylation, in terms of site of the tumor and location of the hypermethylation in CPG island, differs by tumor type.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated, in order to maintain genome integrity. In the case of intergenic regions, DNA methylation helps prevent abnormal karyote, such as deletion, reciprocal translocation and insertions, by silencing cryptic transcription start site and splice site. In the case of repetitive elements, DNA methylation at these sites can silence repeats, therefore, prevent transposition and transcriptional interference. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, decrease in methylation, in cancer. As a result, the genes that were methylated are now active. Abnormal karyote can appear when the cryptic transcription start site and splice site become unmethylated, altering the DNA sequence. Similarly, repeats that were silenced are now active, which can lead to illegitimate recombination. In both cases, DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, in which genes, that were supposed to be silent become active, give out incorrect signals to cells, leading to uncontrollable growth of cell, in another other word, formation of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is a common feature in cancer. Under normal condition, Igf2 is only expressed on paternal allele because H19 is methylated and the enhancers can reach and activate the Igf2. Igf2 is silenced on maternal allele because CTCF binds with ICR which prevents the enhancer from reaching to Igf2, thus, blocking expression of Igf2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is hypermethylated due to a disruption in imprinting. As a result, Igf2 is active in both maternal and paternal alleles. The Igf2 on paternal allele plays an important role in regulating tissue growth. When the maternal Igf2 is also expressed, the cell is capable of producing more tissue, leading to formation of Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As the amount of food grandparents ate during famine decreases, the longevity of their grandchildren also decreases in DutchFamine and Overkalix. Although there’s no molecular data supporting epigenetic inheritance via gametes here, mice experiments demonstrates that DNA-methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. When female mice, agouti-yellow, pseudoagouti-brown and non-agouti, were given methyldonors diets, their offspring had the same coat color. In contrast, when mothers received normal diets, 50%-70% of  offspring display different coat colors.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is featured with epigenetic reprogramming – clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks -- and takes place during early embryonic-development and primordial germ-cell development. Treating patients during these periods isn’t advisable, because it can modify their epigenetic marks. Let’s say an infant has the potential to grow up to 6feet. He received intense treatment like chemotherapy for an illness. Consequently, he didn’t have appetite to eat, thus, receiving fewer nutrients. Because of this nutrient insufficiency, he most likely wouldn’t grow to his inherited 6 feet. Chemotherapy acts as epigenetic modifiers because the drug was administrated during infant’s sensitive-period and it changes the way his phenotype displays without altering his DNA blueprint.</p></div>
