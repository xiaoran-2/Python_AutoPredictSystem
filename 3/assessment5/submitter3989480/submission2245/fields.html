    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the DNA at CpG islands is unmethylated. This allowes the genes close to the CpG island to be expressed. In tumor cells can been observed a hypermethylation at CpG islands. This hypermethylation leads to the silencing of genes which in normal cells would be expressed, such as tumor suppressor genes. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes allowes these cells to divide more rapidely and to escape programmed cell death, leading to cancer.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the CpG sites of the DNA in normal cells are methylated. This leads to silencing of these parts of the genome, and thereby determines genome stability. In cancer cells, these sites are found to me unmethylated. The unmethylation of these parts of the genome leads to genome instability. The repetitive elements are now expressed and can move around in the genome, creating new mutations this way. A general genome instability can also determine the exchange of large parts of DNA between chromosomes, interrupting genes or changing the amount of expression of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 / Igf2 cluster is a locus that is paternally imprinted. On the chromosome that is inherited from the father, the H19 locus is methylated. This determines the silencing of the H19 gene. When this gene is silenced, the Igf2 gene, that is located close to H19 on the DNA strand, will be expressed. The Igf2 gene codes for a protein that is a growth factor.</p>
<p>On the chromosome inherited from the mother, the H19 locus is unmethylated, leading to the expression of the H19 gene. When H19 is expressed, the Igf2 locus is silenced.</p>
<p>By this way, in a normal cell there will be only one of the two copies of Igf2 gene expressed. This imprinting pattern is disrupted in Wilm's tumor: in these tumor cells, also the maternal allele of the H19 locus gets methylated. This determines the silencing of the maternal H19 locus, and thereby the expression also of the maternal Igf2 gene. With the double dose of this growth factor produced inside these cells, they divide more rapidly and escape apoptosis, leading thereby to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means, that it inhibits the methylation of CpG sites in the whole genome. In particular, it inhibits the DNMT, de novo methyltransferases. These transferases lay down the DNA methylation on the newly created strand of DNA during cell division. Decitabine thereby inhibits the methylation of the CpG sites during mitosis. This means, that cells that divide faster, such as tumor cells, will be more severly affected that normal cells, that divide more slowly.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect, because the CpG islands that should be unmethylated, in tumor cells often are found to be methylated. This determines the silencing of genes that should be expressed, such as tumor suppressor genes. By inhibiting DNMT, in the dividing cells these islands will not be methylated, and thereby these genes can be expressed in the daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern of DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. During cell division, DNMTs lay down on the new DNA strand the same pattern of methylation that was found in the parent cell. But there are some periods during which there is a general reprogramming of the methylation pattern of the cells. These periods are called sensitive periods, because external agents can alter this reprogramming. There are two of these periods during development: One can be found during initial embrionic development, and the other during the reproductive cell development. When treating patients with drugs that alter the epigenome during these periods, the reprogramming of the epigenome might fail or might be altered, leading to abnormalities or even the death of those cells. This means that during pregnancy, these drugs should not be used in patients.</p></div>
