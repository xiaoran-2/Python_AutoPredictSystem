    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The norm function of DNA methylation within CpG islands is usually zero because CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation regardless of activity, but the cancer cells to become hypermethylated CpG causing silencing underlying.</p>
<p>Interruption in CpG islands modifies DNA methylation patterns are important for properly regulate the expression of genes and ensure normal human development, so alteration relates to disease. Changes in gene expression may be due to problems in the machinery responsible for producing and maintaining methylation, such as mutations in the genes encoding DNA methyltransferases, or those encoding the DNA-binding proteins or changes methylated in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA or chromatin remodeling complexes which lead to changes in the pattern of methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is linked to differentially methylated regions in allele inactive H19/lgf2 both genes are located in a distal region of chromosome 7 in the mouse and human chromosome 11p15.5, located in the cluster that include 14 imprinted genes, which are involved lncRNAs involved in silencing which act on paternal imprinting processes required for silencing genes encoding proteins expressed as lgf2 maternally. In the maternal allele methylation pattern providing Igf2 gene expression in maternal alleles, these antisense transcripts originating from sense introns of genes. Air gene is sobrelapado the Igf2 gene promoter, the promoter regions of the antisense genes are rich in CpG metilasdas found in maternal alleles.</p>
<p>Interrupting the imprint H19/Igf2 group in Wilms tumor is a defect improntan epigenetic is acquiring methylation in maternal ICR1 caused by the expression of both the maternal and the paternal allele of Igf2 and the simultaneous absence of regulator produced by H19 which leads to the presence of an extra amount of IGF. For this reason, individuals who exhibit this epigenetic defect have a very high risk of having a tumor pediatric Wilms especially.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug is an inhibitor decitabine epigenetic inhibitor class and decreasing acting DNA methylation hypomethylation reducing high methylation, having an impact by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase incorporated into the DNA chain. Therefore in tumor cells that are under uncontrolled methylation by contact with the decitabine may reduce the proliferation of these cells by decreasing the DNA methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Lasting effects of altered DNA methylation on epigenome can have lasting effects as the methylation frequently alter either treatments or inhibitory substance or methylation enhancer, regardless of the inheritance Epigenomic transgerenacional, is affected normal environment has the body which affects three different generations, this involvement directly affects sensitive periods, a sensitive period is a limited time in which an event can occur, resulting in an alteration to exogenous stimuli, these periods are sensitive during embryonic development in the fetus and fetal germ cells.</p>
<p>As already mentioned before the sensitive period is which the organisms are exposed to exogenous stimuli more so is advisable because the treatment would have greater efficacy and the incidence of treatment is higher in sensitive periods of the organism and its effectiveness would be higher .</p></div>
