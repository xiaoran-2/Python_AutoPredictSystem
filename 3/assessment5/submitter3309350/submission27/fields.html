    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation (addition of a methyl group) is one of the epigenetic marks on DNA.</p>
<p>Two types of methylation can contribute to cancer: hypermethylation (more than normal), and hypomethylation (less). Methylation can suppress or enhance cancer growth depending on the context (stage of tumour, type of tumour etc).</p>
<p>CpG islands (and CpG island shores) are normally hypomethylated. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the expression of a gene.</p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, the CpG islands become hypermethylated, and this increases as the cancer progresses. The status of methylation at a CpG island can be a useful diagnostic indicator, relevant for prognosis, and may inform treatment. Note that the hypermethylation tends to be in specific areas.</p>
<p>If the CpG island adjacent to a Tumour suppressor gene is hypermethylated, this can silence the Tumour suppressor genes (one of the required hits to DNA suggested as part of the Knudson hypothesis). Since the methylation is mitotically heritable, this allows the tumour cells to progress to cancer without control by the tumour suppressor gene.</p>
<p><br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated. At these locations, methylation works to maintain genetic stability.  Ie no loss, gain or recombination of chromosomes.</p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurs to some degree in all tumour types, and this progresses as the cancer progresses. In contrast to the specific areas of hypermethylation seen in a cancer cell, the hypomethylation tends to be genome wide.</p>
<p>The result of this disruption depends on the location. For intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it causes genomic instability ie deletions; illegitimate recombination between repeats; activation of repeats and transposition; activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The resulting genetic mutations can drive the progression of cancer. (Wikipedia - Genome instability of cancer) Note that recombination needs open chromatin (Euchromatin) as well as hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div> </div>
<p>A number of drugs, including Decitabine, have been developed to target enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Drugs can affect epigenetic processes, as epigenetic changes are reversible. Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase–inhibitor (DNMTi). It thus acts to inhibit the action of DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT). Decitabine is FDA approved for Myelodysplastic syndrome which have progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (blood cancer). </p>
<p>These cancers show hypermethylation. Hypermethylation is an epigenetic condition where there is more methylation than normal on parts of a genome. Methylation of a gene, or a related part of the genome, typically causes gene silencing.</p>
<p>The DNMTi irreversibly bind DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA. This means they inhibit the action of DNMT to methylate the DNA, and so reduce DNA methylation..</p>
<p>Although it is effective, the way Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect is still unclear. It is suggested the drug might reduce the hypermethylation (silencing) of tumour suppressor genes, and thus allow them to suppress tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the gene expression, or silencing of expression, from one parental allele. Many genes that are imprinted are involved in either promoting or suppressing growth, and so could be involved in cancer.</p>
<p>The features of the H19/Igf2 cluster are discussed below. It is just one example of many where loss of imprinting is associated with the early development of cancer.</p>
<p>In this cluster, imprinting works by blocking enhancers.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR (Imprint control region) is methylated and the CTCF "insulator protein" will not bind to the ICR which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele of a normal cell, the ICR is not methylated which allows the CTCF to bind to the ICR, which means the enhancers act on H19 and Igf2 is silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele by hypermethylation of ICR . The CTCF will not bind on the ICR, so the enhancers act on Igf2, and Igf2 is active.This causes overexpression of lgf2 (a growth promoter) as there is expression of Igf2 on both alleles. This means the cell has a double dose of Igf2 compared to a normal cell, and so can have more growth than normal.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes can be mitotically heritable (affecting somatic cells) and meiotically heritable (causing a transgenerational change). This means that the epigenetic effect of altering DNA methylation by drugs can last beyond the period of a drug treatment. Note that this remains a controversial area as there is still much about it that is not understood. There may be differences in impact between people, between different parts of the genome, and the proportion that is heritable.</span></p>
<p>A "sensitive period" for a cell is when altered environments can have an effect on epigenetic control. During these periods, epigenetic reprogramming occurs (ie epigenetic marks are being removed or being laid down). The two major sensitive periods for cell development are:</p>
<ul><li>Primordial germ cell development through to production of mature eggs and sperm</li>
<li>Preimplantation and post-implantation period for embryos.</li>
</ul><p><span>For mammals, the period of somatic cell maintenance is typically not a sensitive period. However, particular organs will have a brief window during their development where they are sensitive to changes in the environment.</span></p>
<p>Treating a patient during "sensitive periods" of cell development should be avoided as the treatment could disrupt epigenetic reprogramming. This could cause epigenetic abnormalities, with a risk of an adverse impact on patient health. eg increase the risk of cancer.</p>
