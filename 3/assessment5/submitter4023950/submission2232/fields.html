    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>-Methylation being synonymous of silencing gene expression, In normal cells, CpG Island are usually hypomethylated, however, in the case of cancer cells, a hypermethylation of CpG islands is observed.</p>
<p>-CpG Islands are found in the promoter of tumour suppressor genes, hypermethylation will silence the tumour suppressor genes allowing the cancer cells to divide more rapidly or to not die and eventually take over. Along with the genetic mutations, DNA methylation can be one of the multiple hits leading to cancer described in the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>-In normal cells, the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and introns are hypermethylated while a hypomethylation of introns, repetitive elements and intergenic regions is observed in cancer cells.</p>
<p>-Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to instability, it permits illegitimate recombinations between repeats (insertions, deletions and translocations), it also permits the activation of repetitive elements which can make copies of themselves and transpose, and may activate neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A loss of imprinting is observed in cancer cells, causing the monoallelic genes to be expressed or silenced from both parental alleles.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, ICR is methylated abd CTCF can't bind to it, so the enhancers act on Igf2 permitting its expression.</p>
<p>in the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind and insulate it, this leads the enhancers to act on H19, however, Igf2 will be silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the loss of imprinting leads to the hypermethylation of the maternal allele (which is hypomethylated in normal cells)  along with the paternal allele, this leads to the expression of both, and gives a double dose of the growth promoting Igf2 leading to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, therefore the alterations will persist and will be transfered to the progeny.</p>
<p>there are two sensitive periods, during which there is a resetting of epigenetic marks, these pêriods are: primordial germe cell development and pre-implantation development.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
