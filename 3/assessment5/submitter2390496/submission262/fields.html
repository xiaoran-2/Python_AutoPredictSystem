    <div class="field-value"><p>Much effort has been invested in identifying genetic mutations in cancer.  In inherited cancer syndromes this approach has proved successful.  Furthermore, mutations early in the genesis of common cancers have also been identified and these are likely to be associated with tumour initiation.  In contrast, few specific genetic mutations have been linked to tumour progression, leading Feinberg to suggest that epigenetic changes may be involved.  Epigenetic changes occur without a change in the DNA sequence and they can be induced by various factors .  Thus it is possible, for example, that a DNA mutation leads to cellular transformation, but induced changes in the epigenome of the transformed cell enhances the probability that it will be capable of metastasising .  In this scenario, a genetic mutation initiates the cancer but epigenetic change promotes its progression.<br /><br />A genetic alteration in the gene encoding an 'epigenetic enzyme' (e.g. a histone acetyltransferase - see below) may lead to changes within the epigenome.  If, for example, these changes cause the activation of an oncogene then cancer may arise.  In addition, mutations in genes that code for proteins that recognize and bind to epigenetic marks (e.g. methyl binding domain proteins and bromo/chromo domain proteins which bind to methylated DNA and acetylated/methylated histones respectively) could be as important in cancer as mutations in the enzymes themselves.  Although these are genetic events that lead to cancer, an alteration in the epigenome most likely also plays a part.  However, it should be noted that many of the histone-modifying enzymes also modify non-histone proteins, thus making a direct link between enzyme deregulation, changes in the epigenome and cancer extremely difficult.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

<p>Parent-of-origin gene imprinting is part of epigenetics, the study of gene regulation though specific chemical tags called methyl groups that are added to DNA. Without changing the genetic sequence itself, these tags prevent nearby genes from being expressed. The effect is that either the maternal or paternal copy of the gene is expressed, but not both.</p>
<p>The loss-of-imprinting theory suggests that a disruption in the mechanism that regulates imprinting predisposes cells to cancer. Although understanding of this mechanism is far from complete, the results of its dysfunction are becoming clear: When genes lose their imprinted methyl groups, diseases, including cancer, may result.</p>
<p>Maternal and paternal gene imprints, which are created on specific genes during the formation of sperm and eggs, lay the foundation for normal embryonic development, growth, and differentiation. Many of the proteins involved in the imprinting process are then turned off, but Feinberg suggests that some are erroneously turned back on in precancerous cells. This error leads to LOI of some genes and improper imprinting, a term called hypermethylation, of other genes, some of which are tumor suppressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is thought to act as an anti-metabolite. It seems to work by having a toxic effect on the abnormal (MDS) cells. It also appears to affect the DNA in genes that control cell growth. </p>
<p> vivo effects of the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) upon the epigenome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are scarcely studied in primary blasts. Here, we sequentially assessed DNA methylation and transcriptome changes in myeloblasts of DAC-treated AML patients. DNA methylation changes were detected in all patients already after the first series of infusion (median: 6 days). LINE1 analysis indicated global DNA methylation decrease in 7/8 patients. Gene-specific hypomethylating effects were not directly linked to mRNA expression changes. In conclusion, complex DAC-induced DNA methylation changes occur very early and imply mechanisms distinct from non-hypomethylating cytosine analogs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

<p>This is the addition or removal of a methyl group (CH3), predominantly where cytosine bases occur consecutively. DNA methylation was first confirmed to occur in human cancer in 1983, and has since been observed in many other illnesses and health conditions.</p>
<p>Another significant epigenetic process is chromatin modification. Chromatin is the complex of proteins (histones) and DNA that is tightly bundled to fit into the nucleus. The complex can be modified by substances such as acetyl groups (the process called acetylation), enzymes, and some forms of RNA such as microRNAs and small interfering RNAs. This modification alters chromatin structure to influence gene expression. In general, tightly folded chromatin tends to be shut down, or not expressed, while more open chromatin is functional, or expressed.</p>
<p>One effect of such processes is imprinting. In genetics, imprinting describes the condition where one of the two alleles of a typical gene pair is silenced by an epigenetic process such as methylation or acetylation. This becomes a problem if the expressed allele is damaged or contains a variant that increases the organism’s vulnerability to microbes, toxic agents, or other harmful substances. Imprinting was first identified in 1910 in corn, and first confirmed in mammals in 1991.</p>
