    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islans are areas of the genome which are rich CpGs nucleotides, more end could be expected by chance. CpG islands are normally kept free of methylation in the mammalian genome. However in cancer cells, CpG islands situated in promoters are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer there is a two-directional change in DNA methylation. On the one hand there is a genome wide loss of methylation and on the other hand there is seen regional increase in methylation (seen especially in the promoters of tumor suppresor genes). The specific hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppresor genes, involved in e.g. DNA repair and cell cycles, causes genomic instability and cell line deregulation.</p>
<p>Normally intergeneic regions and repetitive elements have methylated DNA. In cancers were DNA methylation is aberrant, such regions tend to be hypomethylated and thus the repetivive elements tend to move across the genome during mitosis. More generally this leads to genomic instability, where among other theres is a illegitimate recombination and activation of repeats and transpositions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).</p>
<p>Decitabine has the ability of hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase (enzymatic block). The way we currently think Decitabine works is by inhibiting methylation by EZH2 , which methylates DNA on nucleosomes, and thus supress tumor suppresor genes.</p>
<p>Though, this can not be known exactly yet, and there could be other and more general effects of the drug. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylations is inherited beyond mitosis (even in cancer cells) and is therefore quite unique among mechanisms of chemotherapy agents. A sensitive period is a period where DNA methylation of cell lines changes - e.g. during developtment.</p>
<p>In humans the sensitive periods are during imprinting and germ cell development.</p>
<p>Therefore it will be inadvisable to treat patients who are pregnant, and childring(germ cell developtment) with these types of drugs.</p></div>
