    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue, the genome is methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements while many CpG islands are hypomethylated.  In cancer, the reverse occurs, global DNA methylation is decreased and at the same time some CpG islands are hypermethylated.  In normal tissue, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated to promote genomic stability. Methylation prevents improper recombination at repetitive elements throughout the genome and discourages movement of transposons (jumping genes) by promoting formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressors are normally hypomethylated to promote transcription and thereby discourage tumor growth.  In cancer, hypomethylation of these intergenic regions, particularly of repetitive elements leads to genomic instability and DNA damage.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes is more common than mutations in cancer.  This increased methylation silences tumor suppressor genes, thus increasing the development of tumors. Increased methylation of CpG islands is correlated with increased tumorogenicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many genes that control growth and growth suppression are commonly imprinting.  In cancer, loss of imprinting can lead to expression or silencing on both parental alleles. In the case of H19/Igf2, the imprinting control region (ICR) is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  When the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF binds and the downstream enhancers act on H19, Igf2 is not expressed.  On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR allows the enhancers to promote transcription of Igf2, a growth related gene.  When imprinting at this locus is lost, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal locus leads to Igf2 overexpression. This double dose of Igf2 promotes tumor growth and may be one of the earliest signs of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent.  This nucleoside analogue irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) after it is incorporated into DNA  in a replication dependent manner.  Although the mechanism of action is still unclear, the reduction of DNA methylation may prevent hypermethlation of CpG islands from being copied to dividing daughter cells. In each round of cell division, the methylation would be reduced 50%.  The reduction in CpG island methylation would reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes and prevent the growth of cancerous cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is passed to daughter cells after cell division in both somatic and germ cells.  In the case of somatic cells, changes to the methylation pattern will be passed on to subsequent generations of cells for the life of the organism.  In the case of germ cells, these changes can be passed to both children and grandchildren.  Sensitive periods are times in which an organism is sensitive to changes in the environment. It is during sensitive periods that epigenetic marks are established. During embryological development, preimplantation to early postimplantation and the development of primordial germ cells to development of gametes are sensitive periods.  It is not advisable to expose people to drugs that alter DNA methylation because these changes are heritable if they get incorporated into the germ cells.  Also, the goal of cancer treatment is to stop growth, a goal that is not compatible with the rapid growth seen in embryos</p></div>
