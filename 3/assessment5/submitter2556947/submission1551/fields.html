    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation is defined as adding a methyl group to cytosine. CpG islands are locations in the DNA that are rich with C and G residues (Cytosine and Guanine) and they are usually found in promoters. This addiction of methyl group to cytosine can cause some changes, it could prevent a substance that could usually bind to the sequence of the promoter to stimulate transcription and so silencing the whole gene. So, DNA methylation is mostly associated with silencing the genes. Normally it is found that CpG islands are unmethylated or hypomethylated in the genome.</p>
<p> In cancer, CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated which results in silencing the gene associated with the CpG island.</p>
<p> Hypermethylation of CpG islands usually result in silencing tumor supressor genes and that results in the increase of cell proliferation activity. These tumor supressing genes could be involved in apoptosis, DNA repair..etc</p>
<p> DNA is usually found to be methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. DNA is methylated in these regions to lock them and avoid their activity since their activity is not needed and could cause problems.</p>
<p> In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p> Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements unlocks them and so they get activated. Unmethylated intergenic regions could cause interruption in transcription and change the final protein product. This new protein product could be of no function and fail to carry on it's function and contribute to the disease, or it could be of a hyper function and increase the cell activity which could lead to cancer. Unmethylated repetitive elements could relocate and cause mutations within the genome, and as it is known that mutations are usually the main reason that turns a normal cell into a cancerous proliferating one.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele's ICR region is methylated so the enhancers found downstream promote the expression of the Igf2 gene found upstream to the ICR region, and the H19 gene is silenced.</p>
<p> In the maternal allele, there is no methylation in the ICR region so an insulator binds to it, making the enhancers promote the expression of the H19 gene instead of the Igf2 gene located upstream.</p>
<p> In Wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated, so the insulator doesn't binds to the ICR region found in both of the alleles which leads to the silencing of the tumor supressor H19 gene and increase the expression of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>  Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to overexpression of Igf2 gene and silencing of H19. Igf2 is only needed from one copy of the chromosome and it's overexpression could disturb the balance and lead to cancer. On the other hand H19 is a tumor supressor gene and in normal conditions only expressed from the maternal allele, silencing a tumor supressor gene would only mean increasing the chance of tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, meaning that it contributes to the removal of the methyl group from the cytosine of the DNA.</p>
<p> Decitabine inhibits the DNMT (DNA methyl transferase) enzyme which is essential to transfer the methyl group in the DNA from the mother to the daughter cell in dividing cells during DNA replication.</p>
<p> Inhibiting DNMT enzyme stops the methylation of further dividing cells resulting in cells having unmethylated DNA. This can reactivate tumor supressor genes silenced by DNA methylation and code for proteins that contribute in stopping the tumor or proliferation of cells. Also, agents that bind to the DNA promoters or other regions, can only bind to unmethylated regions, for example the insulator "CTCF" can only bind to unmethylated "ICR" gene modifying the expression of the "H19" gene which is a tumor supressor. So demethylation can have an anti-tumour effect by activating tumour supressing genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Altering DNA methylation can have effects that last for a long period of time because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. The DNA methylation marks are carried from the mother to the daughter cell's DNA by DNMT (DNA methyl transferase) enzymes.</p>
<p> A sensitive period is the period of time in which epigenetic marks are being reset or created and cells are being differentiated and assigned with different functions.</p>
<p> The first sensitive period is during gametogenesis where epigenetic marks are being reset and imprinting is cancelled. Only epigenetic marks in repetitive elements are being preserved. The second sensitive period is after fertilization and before implantation, in this period the epigenetic marks are being established and the cells are being differentiated.</p>
<p> In sensitive periods, epigenetical marks are being modified naturally assigning every cell to it's function, any disruption to this natural modification could lead to major abnormalities such as tumour, retardation of growth and so on. This is mainly because the drugs that modify epigenetic machinery aren't selective and will affect all cells. This is abnormal because different cells should have different epigenetic marks depending on their function and requirement.</p></div>
