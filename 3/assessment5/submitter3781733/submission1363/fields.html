    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell there are certain regions enriched in cytosine and guanine, known as CpG islands. Those regions are located in the promoters of genes, intergenic regions, repetitive elements and others. One of the fundamental functions of methylation is maintain the genomic stability by repressing transposable particles such as IAP, silencing intergenic regions in order to avoid recombination of this regions with the homologous cromatide. Methylation can also be establish in gene promoters that control the genomic expression and  transcription of particular genes in specific tissues an  cells along  developmental stages.</p>
<p>When the methylation is disrupted, either in the hypomethylation or in the hypermethylation, the genomic stability is committed, leading to aberrant gene expression in oncogenes, tumor supressor genes, non-coding RNAs etc. The  changes in methylation can be caused by alterations in enzymes like DNMT, or alterations in  methylation control proteins. The disruption can appear when occurs one SNP, stochastically, mutation in the epigenetic machinery or by genetic alterations.</p>
<p>Cancer cells exhibit  a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation depending on tumor progression, which can disrupt the status of imprinting control regions, non-coding RNAs, repetitive elements, intergenic regions etc. All these changes alter the regulation of gene expresion and cause aberrant expresion from repetitive element products. One example is the pro-oncogenes that normally have a restricted expression, but when the hypomethylation spreads along genome they begin to be up-regulated, and promotes cell proliferation, blockage of apoptosis etc.</p>
<p>In contrast ,the hypermethylation are often restricted to the promoter regions known as CMIP, that are specific in each tumor phenotype. Tumor supressor genes become silenced  and lead to cell cycle progress, apoptosis evasion and  and uncontrolled division.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an imprinting mark that can be inherited thanks to DNMT1's activity (although DNMT3 is included). DNMT's enzymes recognize hemi-methylated strands, and  methylate the daughter strands.  This explain why if DNMT is blocked, DNA may lose the methylation levels through cell division and change the genomic expression. The subsequent loss of DNA methylation patterns leads to enduring effects on the epigenome. </p>
<p>Epigenetic marks are renewed or suffer drastic changes when cells are in sensitive periods, those periods encompass the embryo's early  development stages and the germ cell's developmental stages. DNA demethylation, histone modifications and chromatin remodeling  are some events that occur in sensitive periods and are related to specific functions and features of each tissue. This modifications expose the epigenome during the sensitive periods and  may be altered by foreign agents and stress, including DNMTi, which leads to alterations in the epigenome.</p>
<p>With regard to the above considerations, treating patients during sensitive periods such as chilhood and adolescence is inadvisable because might be future consequences in the normal cells and most likely in the gametes during puberty.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One example of normal imprinting  is the H19/ Igf2 cluster controlled by imprinting marks. In this cluster the maternal allele harbors an unmethylated ICR, which leads to CTFC binding. CTFC is an insulator that  blocks the enhancer activity over the maternal IGF2 gene and promotes the maternal enhance expression of H19 gene.In the paternal allele occur the opposite event, the ICR are methylated which impairs the CFTC binding and promotes the enhancer activity over the paternal Igf2 gene. Inasmuch that Igf2 and H19 genes are expressed only in one allele, the rate of expression is controlled. </p>
<p>The imprinting of H19/Igf2 can be disrupted in Wilm's tumor due to DNA hypo or hypermetylation, which leads to alterations in the ICR methylation status. Epigenetic changes are present in such way that maternal and  paternal ICRs are methylated, which allows the Igf2 enhances because CTFC can't bind ICRs regions to insulate Igf2 gene from enhancers. All this results in the increase cell proliferation, growth factor independence and other features present in cancer cells. Is possible that  H19 low expression contributes some Wilm's tumor features due to it's lncRNA product.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT's inhibitor, therefore it can block the de novo DNA methylation in a non-selective manner. Decitabine has been employed to treat myelodisplastic syndrome,  because liquid tumors are more accesible to this kind of drugs. This drug binds to  DNMTs after  they are included into the nucleus, and acts in a replication dependent way, and harnesses the  high division activity of cancer cells. Decitabine's lower doses are more efficient to treat cancer progression such as in  myelodisplastic syndrome that becomes in acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>
<p>Certain tumors are sensitive to DNA methylation's disruption. Those tumors underpinned it's cancerigen potential in the silencing of tumor supressor genes, and subsequently, when DNA methylation is blocked,  these can be express again  to control the cell proliferation, apoptosis and so on. Thus decitabine decreases tumor progress and avoids metastasis. </p></div>
