    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, gene expression is regulated by the effect of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA on chromatin structure.  Expression is controlled by promoters, most of which are located in areas of the genome rich in dinucleotide pairs of Cytosine and Guanine linked by a phosphodiester bond (CpG islands).  Methylation of the cytosine inhibits the binding of transcription factors or other proteins involved in gene expression – i.e., methylation inhibits gene expression.  Conversely, enzymes that remove methyl groups (producing hypomethylation), allow transcription factors and other proteins to bind to the naked DNA and facilitate gene expression.</p>
<p>Cancer derives from an imbalance in the normal activity of genes that promote growth (oncogenes) vs genes that restrict growth (tumor-suppressor).  In normal tissue CpG islands tend to be non-methylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, i.e., tumor suppressor genes are activated but growth-promoting oncogenes may be repressed.  In cancer, this methylation pattern is reversed:  the CpG islands are hypermethylated, leading to silencing of tumor suppressor expression, and the intergenic regions and areas of repetitive elements are hypomethylated, leading to expression of oncogenes and repeats. </p>
<p><em>Hyper</em>methylation of the DNA and/or its histone proteins can effectively silence specific regions or widespread areas of the genome by locking it up in a heterochromatin (non-transcription) state. </p>
<p><em>Hypo</em>methylation of intergenic regions can facilitate the expression of oncogenes that would normally be repressed.  Hypomethylation can also lead to genomic instability with illegitimate recombinations of the two DNA strands.  Insertions, deletions, or translocations of fragments of chromosomes occur where there are erroneous pairings of hypomethylated stretches of the DNA and affect normal expression or repression of genes that have been moved.  In addition, hypomethylation may activate repetitive elements, allowing them to “jump” (translocate) into areas of the genome where they can erroneously activate certain promoters.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Question 2.  </p>
<p>Genetic imprinting is a mechanism by which specific parent-of-origin genes are expressed while the other parent’s alleles are silenced.  This is achieved by DNA methylation and repressive histone modification of the imprint control region (ICR associated with the promoter) of the imprinted allele.  For example, paternal expression of the Igf2 gene promotes growth, while the ICR/promoter of a linked H19 gene, that restricts growth, is methylated and silenced (<em>H19 OFF</em>).  In contrast, the unmethylated ICR of H19 in the female binds an insulator protein, CTCF, which interacts with downstream enhancers and prevents their binding and promoting expression of Igf2 (<em>Igf2 OFF</em>).  Thus, maternal expression puts a brake on paternal expression at these loci.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hypermethylation of ICRs can lead to a loss or disruption of the normal imprinting function (i.e., monoallelic parent-of-origin expression), in this case, of Igf2.  If the maternal H19 allele becomes methylated, like the paternal allele, then CTCF will not bind, H19 will not be expressed, and the enhancers <em>will</em> bind – not to the maternal ICR-CTCF complex, but to the Igf2 promoter -- with the resultant hyper-stimulation of growth.  This is the basis for at least one example of tumorigenesis, in the case of Wilm’s tumor of the kidney, which occurs in children.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When tumor suppressor genes are silenced in bone marrow stem cells by hypermethylation of CpG islands, unchecked growth of abnormal blood cells and myelodysplastic syndrome may result.  Decitabine, like azacytidine, is a DNMT (methyl transferase) inhibitor.  Both drugs are analogs of cytosine, and can replace it in newly synthesized DNA.  But unlike cytosine, the analogs bind DNMT irreversibly, sequestering it and removing it from its normal action:  i.e., methylating DNA and silencing gene expression at that location.  Thus administration of Decitabine should lead to hypomethylation of DNA and continued expression of genes that may promote tumor suppression to regulate cell proliferation.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By definition, epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable.  Thus, alterations of the epigenetic state of a particular portion of the genome by drug treatment would be continued in all daughter cells and could affect the response of those cells to other cancer therapeutic agents.  For example, a drug that hypomethylates DNA could remove some repressive marks but still require another epigenetic inhibitor or chemotherapeutic agent to activate a silenced gene or facilitate a regulatory enzyme. This type of therapy seems to work well in older (post-reproductive) adult patients, but is problematic for younger individuals exhibiting tumors or neoplasias. </p>
<p>Throughout development to adulthood epigenetic marks are established in response to environmental challenge and can change normal genetic expression.  Vulnerability to environment begins with the critically sensitive periods of blastocyst formation and gametogenesis in the embryo, when epigenetic reprogramming is carried out.  Further,<em> in utero</em> maternal hormones, exogenous chemicals (e.g. pesticides), nutrition, and maternal behavior can alter epigenetic status during sensitive periods in childhood development.  Because of this prolonged sensitivity to environmental impact on the epigenome and because the higher proportion of actively growing and maturing tissue in children, it appears inadvisable to treat them with the same types of therapeutic agents as older adults. </p></div>
