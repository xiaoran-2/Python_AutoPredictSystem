    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents (aka, hypomethylating agents). These drugs act to remove DNA methylation and thereby enable transcription of previously methylated regions of the genome. Hypermethylation of CpG islands, which are often found in gene promoters, can prevent transcription factors from binding the promoter, effectively blocking expression of the associated gene. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is commonly observed in cancer cells where it is thought to deactivate genes which act as tumor suppressors. Without the activation of these genes, cell division is unregulated and results in tumor formation. Decitabine acts to remove methylation from CpG islands and reenable transcription of tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine does this by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, the protein responsible for adding methylating CpG sites. If CpG methylation is not actively maintained, DNA replication will dilute out DNA methylation, resulting in child cells free of these epigenetic marks.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is actively maintained after DNA replication so that the methylation state of a parent cell is maintained in the child cells. The altered methylation state of a cell will therefore be passed to child cells and can have an enduring effect. This might explain how epigenetic drugs can make tumor cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy even after patients are no longer on the drugs. However, there are some periods of development during which epigenomic marks are radically modified, and any alterations of the epigenome in these periods can have drastic effects on future development. These so-called sensitive periods occur during early embryonic development, when removal of epigenetic marks reverts cells to a pluripotent state from which all the tissues of the developing embryo can be derived, and also during gamete formation, when eggs and sperm are derived from somatic cells. Treating a patient with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods may disrupt the wide-scale epigenetic changes occurring during these times and could have devastating effects. It is especially not advised to treat pregnant women with epigenetic drugs for this reason.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions with a high occurrance of CpG sites and are commonly found near promoter regions. CpG islands can be marked by DNA methylation which blocks transcription factor binding, effectively silencing the associated gene. In normally functioning cells, methylation of CpG islands is important in turning off sets of genes as appropriate for a given cell type. However, in cancer, many CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated, resulting in a number of genes being inactivated when they should not be. This is a sign of abnormal cell functioning in cancer. Specifically, many genes normally involved in regulating the cell growth cycle -- so-called tumor suppressors -- will be inappropriately methylated in cancer, resulting in uncontrolled cell proliferation in affected cells and tumorigenesis. Somewhat surprisingly, other regions of the genome, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, are often hypomethylated in cancer cells, indicating that the role of methylation in disease cells depends on context. In normal cells, many long non-coding RNA, found in intergenic regions of the genome, are active in directing chromatin remodeling complexes. For example, the lncRNA HOTAIR interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PCR2) in the regulation of chromatin state. Thus, methylation of these intergenic regions often helps control the chromatin state of the cell. Additionally, repetitive elements are usually methylated and packed in heterochromatin in normal cells. It is thought that this lessens the potential for a misaligned recombination in repetitive regions where such a mistake is more likely. For these reasons, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer disrupts the cell's ability to control chromatin state and its ability to recombine consistently. These result in genomic instability and further genetic abberations which may underly some cancers' ability to mutate resistance to therapeutics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The protein lgf2 is a growth factor hormone that is important for inducing growth in early development. However, overexpression of lgf2 can disrupt normal development, so lgf2 is maternally imprinted to control its expression. In lgf2's imprinted state, the insulator protein CTCF binds an imprint control region (ICR) that lies between lgf2 and a downstream enhancer. When bound to its ICR, CTCF prevents the preferred looping structure of the chromatin and blocks the enhancer from acting on lgf2. Instead the enhancer acts on the lncRNA H19. Expression of maternal lgf2 is blocked in this way, while the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated to prevent CTCF from binding it and suppressing lgf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, this normal pattern of imprinting is disrupted by the abberant methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, thereby blocking CTCF just as in the paternal allele. Thus, lgf2 is overexpressed in such cells, contributing to unregulated growth and the development of a tumor.</p></div>
