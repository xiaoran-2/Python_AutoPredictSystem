    <h1>Submission 56 from Anon (session_user_id: 66a05ceaf71ab6a786e9b47be6d036112496dd3a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The more we know about DNA methylation ocurring in CpGs islands in cancer cells, the more clear it is that we should develop drugs that are able to block this methylation. DNA-Methyltransferase inhibitor drugs (DNMTi) do exactly what it names implies. Decitabine is one of such drugs and it has recently been proved to have an anti-tumour activity in cancer cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNMTis are nucleoside analogus, e.i. they work as a suitable target for DNMTs which then binds irreversibly. Nonetheless, it is both replication dependant, you must have replicating cells for it to work continously; and dose dependant as only a small quantity produces an anti-neoplastic effect, whereas too much is toxic and non-functional.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On a final note, DNMTi used in conjunction with Histone Deacetylase inhibitors(HDACi) were shown to be useful in fighting solid tumours and also in getting better results in subsequent standard chemoterapeutics.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is usually seen as the result of more than one unfortunated hit as stated by Knudson's hypotesis. Indeed, cancer cells present critical diffences from normal cells which are nowadays being studied throughtly by scientist to help in better understanding of this disease.<br /><span style="font-size:14px;">Two of the widely accepted characteristics in cancer cells are:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;">CpGs islands </span><strong style="font-size:14px;">hypermetylation</strong><span style="font-size:14px;"> leading to </span><strong style="font-size:14px;"><em>activation</em> </strong><span style="font-size:14px;">of oncogenes.</span></li>
<li>Genome-wide <strong>hypometylation</strong> leading to <strong><em>inactivation</em> </strong>of tumour suppresor gene silencing.</li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;"> </span></li>
</ul><p>CpGs islands (also called GCIs) are clusters of CG dimers with a phosphate group found throughout the genome in certain regions with more frecuency than it would have occurred by chance.These CpGs islands are found to be not methylated in normal cells where they are mostly promoters for tumour supressor genes; but are heavily methylated in cancer. They represent an effective way to identify different tumours (e.g. RB in eye cancer, MGMT in colon cancer, etc). These are usually studied using highly specific DNA-hypermetylation biomarkers to detect the level of tumoricity; as a higher level of methylation is correlated with higher tumorigenicity. Hypermethylation can cause great damage to genome by disrupting tissue-specific genes and <span style="font-size:14px;">imprinted genes. A good example is seen in Wilm's tumour, caused by hypermetylated of its Imprinted Control Region (ICR).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><br /></span></p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are parts of the DNA which are expected to be silenced in a normal cell since they are in some way related to genomic stability. Contrariwise, in cancer cells you can observe a lack of methylation in these areas which allows illegitimate translocation between non-homologus chromosomes leading to activation of repeats, disruption of neighbouring genes and also insertion/deletions.Surprisingly, when CpG poor promoters are hypometylated, they express genes (such as miRNAs) that are normally methylated; although this is somewhat less common.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are special genes which are expressed in only one of two alleles in a set of chromosomes. Also they are not reset during early development as other typical epigenetic marks are, indeed it escapes reprogramming. But this process is critical for embryo development as two male or two female nucleus (called uniparental disomy) cannot produce a viable organism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>H19/igf2 cluster is an example of paternal imprinting, that is the paternal allele is silent. This occurs in Imprinted Control Regions (ICRs) which are unmethylated in females allowing for an insulator protein (CTCF) to bind this ICR and thus producing the expression of H19 by binding this gene to some downstream enhancers. In males, this methylated ICR doesn't provide a binding site for the insulator protein thus causing downstream enhancers to bind Igf2 instead of H19 gene and express Igf2, consequently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Individuals suffering from Wilm's tumour, a type of chilhood kidney tumour, have their paternally imprinted (e.i. methylated) H19/Igf2 cluster ICR as would be expected on a normal child; but their maternal allele happens to be imprinted too! This leads to an overexpression of Igf2, which is growth promoting and the subsequent proliferation of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are nowadays a new group of drugs that are being studying for epigenetic abnormalities. We know cancer shows a particular pattern of methylation, so making this pattern normal again seems like a promising prospect. DNMTi are used for removing some of the methylation in cancer and since the binding is irreversible, the drug has a permanent effect on that cell until its further division.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike genetic errors, the epigenome is known to be reset in a process called epigenetic reprogramming. Taking place in critical moments in an organism' life cycle, known as sensitive periods, they stand as an effective way to control enzimatic regulators as this reprogramming erases epigenetic marks. There are two sensitive periods: the first occurs from the Primordial Germ Cell (PGC) to the differentiated gamete, and the second is the preimplantation to early post implanation period.</p>
<p><br />However, the age of the organism should be considered because of its effect on PGCs and young pacient should be carefully monitored when treated this way. Further studied need to be made to ensure its safety. Also, although there was some initial wariness of these drugs believed to affect undiscriminatingly all cell types, were found to be serendipitously effective.</p></div>
