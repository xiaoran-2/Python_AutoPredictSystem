    <h1>Submission 859 from Anon (session_user_id: 67df1165d6b135d20fda6f71ea9329da9dbc328a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog that inhibits DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT). As a cytidine analog, Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA of a replicating cell.  Once part of the genome, Decitabine will irreversibly bind DNMT molecules that try to methylate it.  This irreversible binding reduces the number of DNMT molecules in the cell able to methylate DNA resulting in significantly reduced DNA methylation (hypomethylation).  In many cancers CpG islands associated with the promoter of  tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated.  As DNA methylation is mitotically stable, this hypermethylation is passed onto daughter cells in the dividing cancer. Decitabine acts to eliminate or reduce the methylation of these CpG islands in the daughter cells possibly restoring at least some functionality of the tumour suppressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele’s H19/IGF2 ICR and H19 promoter is methylated.  This methylation pattern prevents the binding of the CTCF insulating protein to the paternal ICR, which allows the downstream enhancer to bind to the paternal IGF2 gene, allowing IGF2 transcription from the paternal allele.  On the other hand, in a normal cell the maternal allele displays a lack of methylation at the H19/IGF2 ICR and H19 promoter.  Here, the CTCF insulating protein binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR, preventing the downstream enhancer from binding to IGF2, but instead binds to H19.  This allows H19 transcription from the maternal allele, while silencing IGF2 from the maternal allele.  Thus, in a normal cell, IGF2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, the paternal allele is methylated at the H19/IGF2 ICR as usual resulting in IGF2 expression; however, the maternal allele is also methylated at the H19/IGF2 ICR and H19 promoter leading to IGF2 expression from the maternal allele also. This hypermethylation leads to twice the amount of IGF2 being expressed in the tumour cells.  IGF2 is a growth factor whose less regulated transcription contributes to Wilm’s tumour disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods are times during development when large-scale epigenetic reprogramming occurs.  There are two large-scale reprogramming events: early development and primordial germ cell development.  In early development immediately after fertilization the epigenetic marks are erased from both parental DNA strands to allow for totipotency. Tissue specific epigenetic marks are then applied as development occurs. Development of primordial germ cells is the second large-scale epigenetic reprogramming event.  This event starts at mid-gestation as epigenetic marks are erased from both DNA strands and then marks are applied as the gametes mature.  DNA methylation is mitotically stable, that is, once applied or removed, that action is passed to daughter cells when the cell divides.  Changes to DNA methylation during these sensitive periods can cause methylation states that are hypo- or hyper- to the normal state causing inappropriate DNA silencing (if inappropriate methylation is added) or transcription (if normal methylation is removed).  These abnormal states would then be passed to daughter cells if done during early development or cause abnormal gametes if done during PGC development - either of which could lead to disease or inappropriate development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, in conjunction with histone modifications and non-coding RNA, silences transcription.  The pattern of gene silencing varies from tissue to tissue, as well as during development.  According to Hassler, et al (Epigenomics of Cancer – Emerging New Concepts), in a normal cell, CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, are not methylated regardless of the associated gene’s transcriptional state.  However, in many cancers these CpG  islands become hypermethylated, silencing the associated gene.  Many of these silenced genes are tumor suppressor genes or other genes associated with growth control, allowing the cancer to grow unfettered.  In addition to CpG islands, others areas of a gene can be DNA methylated.  In normal cells, repetitive elements, which are generally remnants of past retroviral infections, are heavily methylated.  This methylation pattern prevents transcriptional activation of the repetitive regions.  However, in many cancers, these repetitive regions are not methylated, allowing transcription.  These transcription products give rise to active DNA that will insert themselves randomly into chromosomes causing significant instability (insertions, deletions, inappropriate chromosomal combinations, etc).  Some cancers may be driven by this chromosomal instability.  In intergenic regions, normal cells may have methylation at highly expressed genes, which, according to Hassler, may reducing transcriptional noise or impact RNA splicing.  In many cancer cells, these intergenic regions are hypomethylated.  This lack of methylation may result in inappropriate transcription or RNA splicing.</p></div>
