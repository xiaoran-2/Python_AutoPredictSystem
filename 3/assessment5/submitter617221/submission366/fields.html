    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>CpG dinucleotides may be methylated leading to chromatin condensation and/or blocking of transcription factor binding both which decrease transcription.  Most promoters contain CpG islands (clusters of CpG dinucleotides), and CpG islands tend to have a lower level of methylation than “non-island” CpG dinucleotides . The lack of methylation of CpG islands within promoters allows loosely packed chromatin condusive for transcription.</li>
<li>Tumor suppressor genes control cellular reproduction, apoptosis, and DNA repair.Mutations of the genes for methylation/de-methylation enzymes can lead to aberrant DNA methylation patterns that can increase methylation CpG islands and “island shores” in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes which may lead to aberrant cell groth and cancer.Increased methylation of CpG islands is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in some cancers.</li>
<li>Silencing of other types of genes due to methylation of CpG islands within promoters can lead to the silencing of many important gene products that may give rise to a wide variety of disease states.</li>
<li>Methylation of intergenic regions increases genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription initiation and splice sites reducing production of inappropriate gene products. Methylation of repetitive elements reduces illegimate recombination, translocation, and protects against transposable elements. </li>
<li>Cancerous cells exhibit genome wide hypomethylation leading to genomic instability as intergenic regions and repetitive elements may be activated resulting increased transposon replication, translocation errors, inapproprately spliced proteins, and protein products with large insertions or deletions due to the transcription machinery begining at a cryptic transcription start site.</li>
<li>Disease is increased due to increased genomic instability and affected imprint control regions (ICRs). Aberrant protein production may lead to many types of disorders, and loss of imprinting can lead to embryonic death or disease as growth and differentiation may be seriously impaired.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The H19 promoter and ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and thus silenced resulting in a lack of CTCF insulating protein. Without the insulating CTCF enhancers are free to interact with the Igf2 gene increasing its expression.</li>
<li>The H19 promoter of the maternal allele is not methylated and thus CTCF is produced and binds to the ICR which insulates the Igf2 gene from enhancers causing silencing.</li>
<li><strong> </strong>Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in methylation of the maternal H19 promoter causing no CTCF to be producing and an increase in the Igf2 gene product. Igf2 is an oncogene and the over expression of its product, insulin-like growth factor, may lead to abnormal cell proliferation in the developing kidney of an affected child causing Wilm's tumor.</li>
<li>Disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease via the over/under production of insulin-like growth factor. Changing the concentration if insulin like growth factor can disrupt the cell-cycle, cell growth, affect apoptosis, and may lead to abnormal overgrowth and/or cancerous cell growth.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Decitibine is a DNA-demethylating agent.</li>
<li>Decitibine causes methyl groups bound to DNA to be removed causing chromatin to pack more loosley.</li>
<li>Decitibines action of opening chromatin may increase transcription levels of affected genes. If the gene is tumor-suppressing the increased transcription would likely have and anti-tumor effect. For example, a tumor suppressing gene could code for a DNA repair enzyme. If that gene is silenced by methylation of CpG islands within its promoter it could cause a disease state/cancer. The admimistration of decitabine could re-activate the gene by removing the methyl groups and thus increasing transcription again.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation is passed on to daughter cells by methyl transferase enzymes, so a change to DNA methylation in one cell will be passed on to to the entire lineage of that cell.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods include the clearing of epigenetic marks and re-establishment of imprinted genes, and these processes occur mostly during embryonic development and gametogenesis. </li>
<li>The clearing of epigenetic marks and re-establishment of imprinted genes occur embryonic and germ cell development. Sensitive periods for food supply is the “slow growth period” which occurs from 9 – 12 years in males and 8 – 10 years in female; increased food during these periods corrlelated with a shorter life span in their grandchildren.</li>
<li>Clearing of epigenetic marks and the correct establishment of imprinted genes is critical during sensitive periods. Healthy differentiation and development cannot occur with abnormal epigenetic changes during sensitive periods. The administration of drugs that affect the epigenome during these times may cause drastic disease causing alterations, embryonic death, aberrant differentiation and development, and apoptosis or abnormal development of germ cells.</li>
