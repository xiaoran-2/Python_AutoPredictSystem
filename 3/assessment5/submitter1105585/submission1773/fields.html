    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation is to silence gene expression by promoting heterochromatin structures.  In promoters, methylated CpG islands can prevent transcription factors from binding, preventing genes from being expressed.  In cancer, CpG islands are generally hypermethylated across the genome.  In cancer, CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes are typically hypermethylated, thus preventing their expression.  Since CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressors are hypermethylated, tumor suppressor proteins are not produced, allowing cells to proliferate at a faster rate than normal.  Over time, the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors enables cancer to grow.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpG islands are typically methylated to promote genomic stability.  In allowing for heterochromatic regions, these marks prevent illegal recombinations between non-equivalent chromosomes and other kinds of cancer-promoting chromosomal recombinations (as well as DNA transposition of repetitive elements), thus providing overall genomic stability.  In cancer, these CpG islands are hypomethylated, allowing for euchromatin in intergenic regions and reptitive elements.  Since the chromatin at these regions in no longer condensed, they become susceptible to the kinds of swaps that lead to cancer. Hypomethylation at these regions acts to promote cancer by promoting genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprinting control region and H19 are both methylated; this prevents the insulator protein, CTCF, from binding to the ICR, allowing the enhancers to loop and activate Igf2 expression.  H19 expression is blocked from the methylation. </p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the imprinting control region and H19 are both unmethylated; this enables the insulator protein, CTCF, to bind the ICR, preventing the enhancers to loop and activate Igf2 expression.  Igf2 is silenced, while H19 is expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR in both maternal and paternal alleles, enabling enhancers to loop and promote expression of Igf2 in both alleles.</p>
<p>With this double dosage of Igf2, there is more growth promotion than normal, and over the course of time this leads to cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>By inhibiting DNMT enzyme, Decitabine reduces DNA methylation overall. </p>
<p>The goal of this DNA demethylation is to counteract the effects of hypermethylation at CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes that is typical of cancer.  By reducing DNA methylation in these regions, Decitabine allows for tumor suppressor genes to once again be expressed, slowing the growth of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation during sensitive periods is problematic because it interferes with stages of development where epigenetic reprogramming is most dramatic.  Since epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, any kind of global depression or elevation of methylation due to the introduction of a chemotherapeutic agent would have a lasting effect. </p>
<p>A sensitive period during development is one where the epigenome is actively remodelled, and so epigenetic state can be modulated by external/environmental factors during these times.  </p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development.  One is during the maturation of primordial germ cells into mature gametes.  Another is the period between pre-implantation and early post-implantation of the embryo. </p>
<p>By treating a patient during a sensitive period, you are interfering with global epigenetic reprogramming that is critical for normal development.  In the pre to post-implantation embryo, any kind of interference via chemotherapy could prevent normal development of tissues and cell lineages (which require high degree of specificity and accuracy in the laying of DNA methylation marks).  In the production of gametes, interference with epigenetic reprogramming could cause improper production of mature sperm and egg, leading to fertility issues. </p></div>
