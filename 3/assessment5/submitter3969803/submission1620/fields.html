    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, methylation of CpG islands means silencing of underlying genes. Only small portions of CpG islands are dinamically methylated, and this regions vary between celular type. However, CpG islands tends to be protected from methylation. In cancer cells occurs hypermethylation of CpG islands, thus disrupting their normal function. This contributes to diseases by silencing tumor suppressor genes. <br />On other hand, methylation of intergenic regions avoids unstable transcription by selecting RNA polymerases binding sites, and methylation of repetitive elements regulate their transcription activity. In cancer cells, both of these marks are altered through hypomethylation, disrupting their function, by leaving many RNA polymerases binding sites open (and probably resulting in altered or truncated proteins) in the case of intergenic regions, or by activating strong transcription activity sites (which can also acts on many genome sites) in the case of repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. This class of inhibitors reduces the level of methylation in DNA transmitted to the daughter cells. The drug can have a high impact in cells with high replication levels, such as cancer cells.<br />Some tumours show high hypermethylation during their first stage of developement, so the drug can have a anti-tumour effect during this period. Not all tumours show the same alterations on their methylation levels, so the drug should be administrated knowing the life cycle of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations on DNA methylation can have enduring effects, because methylation in the DNA is transmitted to the daughter cells. Specific methylations on the DNA are highly conserved in cells of the same tissue.<br />This alterations occur naturally on sensitive periods, they are stages during the developement of an organism, where the epigenome can be alterated, changing the epigenetic marks of the individual. This stages mainly occur nearly fertilization to blastocist stage of the embryo, and in formation of gametes from primordial germ cells. There are also evidence showing that during the early stages of life there are still high posibilities of epigenetic alteration. <br />Treating patients during sensitive periods could be inadvisable, because changes during these stages can result in loss of control of epigenetic marks, leading to less genome stability. Also, the detection of an alteration in epigenetic marks can be hard to detect during early stages of life.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the cluster has an enhancer site, where imprinting control region is methylated at the paternal allele. Here, the enhancer acts on Igf2 gene. The methylation also spans through H19 gene site, where the enhancer can not activate H19 gene expression. The imprinting control region is not methylated on the maternal allele, so the allele is able to bind CTCF, which blocks the transcription of Igf2, and the enhancer acts on H19 gene expression.<br />In cancer cells occurs hypermethylation of imprinting control region, leading the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele. In this case there is overexpression of the Igf2 protein, which is a growth promoter. This loss of imprinting is seen in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>
