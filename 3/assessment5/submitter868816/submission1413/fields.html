    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong></p>
<p>CpG islands are usually found in the gene promoters and tend to be protected from methylation while the gene is active. CpG island methylation in the gene promoter leads to the silencing of this gene. So, the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing, and non-silenced genes have unmethylated CpG islands in the promoters.</p>
<p>In cancer cells however CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which leads to gene silencing.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation can be also identified in tumor suppressor genes promoters, which results in silencing of tumor suppressors and leads to cancer cells uncontrolled proliferation. These epigenetic mutations are stable because they’re heritable during mitosis.</p>
<p><strong>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong></p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells tend to be methylated. Methylation in intergenic regions helps to keep genome stable.</p>
<p>In cancer cells however,  intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. This leads to genome instability, which results in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Also activation of poor promoters may result in abnormal expression of different oncogenes, which also results in tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>All these factors lead to development of different types of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele imprint control region (IRC) near H19 is methylated. This blocks enhancers downstream to act on H19 and allows them to act on Igf2, leading to its expression. Thus paternal allele expresses Igf2 and doesn’t express H19.</p>
<p>On maternal allele IRC near H19 is unmethylated. CTCF protein binds to this unmethylated site and insulates it. This allows the enhancers downstream to activate H19 expression.  This will result in Igf2 silencing.  Thus maternal allele doesn’t express Igf2 and expresses H19 instead.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor both paternal and maternal alleles are methylated, so both alleles express Igf2 and don’t express H19. So tumor cells have twice as much of Igf2 compared to normal cells.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting, so increased amount of it leads to the growth of this type of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It acts as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. DNMT is responsible for keeping methylation marks during mitosis, so DNMT inhibition leads to the loss of methylation marks during mitosis and leads to passive DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>This probably leads to CpG islands demethylation in daughter cells, which stops abnormal gene expression and stops growth of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation may act as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors.  Inhibiting DNMT leads to inability of establishing methylation during mitosis. Thus cells passively loose DNA methylation with each division.</p>
<p>Methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, so once lost it won’t be recovered again in the progeny cells. Cancer cells have abnormal methylation pattern, so with this pattern removed, the growth of tumor is inhibited.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy kills cancer cells, but with loss of epigenetic marks cancer cells can no longer keep their function with duplication, making chemotherapy more effective.</p>
<p>But these DNMTi drugs should be used with caution during epigenetically sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic marks are removed and re-established during germ cell development.  Adolescence and pregnancy are two most sensitive periods: during adolescence germ cells are finally developed and during pregnancy new germ cells of the fetus are laid down.</p>
<p>Inhibiting DNMT (as well as altering other epigenetic machinery)  is not a good idea during sensitive periods (and this means younger patients) because this is likely lead to errors in epigenetic marks reestablishing during germ cell development which will have an effect on the patient's possible children. </p></div>
