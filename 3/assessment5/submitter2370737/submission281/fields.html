    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a genetic disease. Epigentics is essentially non DNA sequence modifcation of the genome allowing for the expression or non expression of genes. Epigenetic methylation of DNA affests gene expression at CpG islands that are located at promoter regions. Active promoters are mostly unmethylated and active. Differentiated cells will methylate non essential CpG islans to down regulate expression. Non essential gene expression occurs in cancer with the loss of tumor suppressor gene function with excessive hypermethylation of the promoter regions. The structure of chromatin is determined in part by DNA methylation. It is the 3-D structure of the chromatin that in part can control gene expression as in t he case of X inactivation as a model. The loss of chromatin structure with methylation loss allows for activation ans rearrangement of genes that leads to uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. The intergeneic regions and repeat DNA elements that are involed in chromatin structure.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting can cause cancer. Imprinting is the preferential suppresssion of one of 2 alleles. The HH19/IGF2 cluster is a maternally imprinted cluster. The H19 is paternally silenced bymethylation while the maternal allele is active.  The H19 gene product is a non coding long RNA that suppresses the expression of the IGF2 gene. In the normal state   the IGF2 gene which is growth promoting remains down regulated. One varient of Wilm's tumor is felt to be as a results of the loss maternal imprinting ie increaased methylation of the maternal H19. This results in up regulation of IGF2 and increased growth and tumor development. Simularly up regulation of IGF2 can also result in Bickwith-Weidmann syndrome that is expressed phenotypically as over sized growth in certain body parts. It would appear that these two disease state are a result of the time that these events occur in development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Economist article is clearly written by a non scientist for general consumption. It tends to over state the positive while ignoring the negatives. It reviews the use of Decitabine for cancer. This is a DNA methylation inhibitor. The drug ig is phosphorylated and then incorporated into a dividing cells DNA. It is then able tp act as an inhibitor to DNA methytransferase. This results in the hypomethylation of DNA. Therefore the function of  the chromatin and chromosomes are disrupted with the sultant failure of cellular division and death of the cell. The side effect profile of this drug in clinical practice is fairly toxic wth about a 20% advers side effect on healthy cells. It is clinically helpfull but it is not a  break through drug as remissions in MDS and AML are under 30-50% with only modest long term survival.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylated DNA is faithfully reproduced in the dividing somatic cell. It can also be transmitted in the germ line but most methyl marks are removed at gemetogenesis and early development.  During development DNA undergoes methylation to silence and activate sets of genes particular to each cell line. A sensitive period is any age of  the organism where a few cells wil give rise to many potential descendents. In medicine a clinically sensitive time is really any time from concenption to adulthood and during gametogenesis. Practically it really is most of the life of the organism but especially until the individual has completed thir child bearing years. Epigentic chemotherapy as are most other chemotherapeutic drugs are mutagenic eith throug epigentic changes or direct injury to the DNA sequence or breaks and rearrangemtns of the chromasome. So wwe are left with the ethical question of t o save the life of the individual or be concerned about the possible effects on their offspring. Will they develop cance or some other new epgigentic disease. </p></div>
