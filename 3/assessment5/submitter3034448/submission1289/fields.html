    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at the CpG islands in the gene promoter, is to function as silencer of its activity. When the DNA methylation is disrupted, in case of cancer tissue, the CpG islands are more prone to DNA hypermethylation, causing silencing of the underlying gene. This hypermethylation tends to happen in tumour suppressor genes, promoting gene silencing and hence the control of the cell regulation, becoming more unstable and leading to disease or cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements avoids recombinations and suppresses elements that could otherwise bring instability in the underlying gene body regions. When DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer tissue, these regions become hypomethylated leading to open chromatin (euchromatin) and consequent genomic instability throught deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. This genomic instability may be produced from a process of global hypomethylation and may reflect increased transcriptional activity. The genes subject to this global hypomethylation, may contain sites hypomethylated in coding regions in normal tissues, that can become demethylated in cancers, thus favoring diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents. In normal tissues the CpG islands are hypomethylated and in cancer tissues they become hypermethylated thus silencing specific genes. Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and hence it targets DNA by inhibiting the DNA-methyltransferase which catalizes the transfer of methyl groups into DNA targeting the CpG islands. These inhibitors get incorporated in the DNA producing the inhibition of the DNA-methyltransferase, which leads to cleareal of methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter regions and hence restoring gene transcription. When cell division happens at high rate, which is the case of cancer tissue, this mechanism will regulate the rate to its normal levels.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Modifying the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, when the treatment being applied somehow inhibits epigenetic control or mechanisms, that transfer or remove methyl groups in DNA. The inhibitors can become incorporated in the DNA and/or RNA inhibiting enzymes responsible for DNA-(de)methylation. Hence when cell division happens this mechanism is maintained during replication. Thus, the period of drug treatment may directly influence the epigenome of the individual being treated and hence have its effects maintained throughout all its life. In case the period of drug treatment coincides with a sensitive period, then these modifications are spread to descendants generated after the treatment period. A sensitive period is a period when the environment can influence epigenetic control, meaning an epigenetic reprogramming were epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Sensitive periods of development comprise the early embryonic development (pre and post implantation periods) and the primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods will lead to long lasting epigenetic changes that are transferred to the descendants of the individuals being treated, hence these descendants will carry epigenetic modifications that will harm them. Hence, it becomes a concern to be aware of these sensitive periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of several regions which are differently treated in the maternal and paternal alleles. In case of the paternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated which leads to impossible binding of CTCF insulator protein, thus allowing enhancers to reach Igf2 gene and enchance its expression. The maternal allele contains an unmethylated ICR which can be bonded by the CTCF insulator protein. This protein prevents enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene and hence they will instead enhance the expression of H19 lncRNA. When disruption of imprinting from this cluster happens the expression of Igf2 is drastically increased. The cluster will suffer loss of imprinting, meaning that the maternal allele will become methylated at the ICR and hence similiar to the paternal allele. This leads to increased expression of the oncogene Igf2 from both alleles, taking to disease by promoting growth. This disruption of imprinting in this cluster will lead to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>
