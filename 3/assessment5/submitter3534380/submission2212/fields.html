    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites that typically are 300-3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately 40% of promoters of mammalian genes.  CPG’s are underrepresented in the human genome because DNA methylation is mutagenic. <strong>Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression.</strong> Methylation often occurs a short distance from the CpG islands (at "CpG island shores") rather than in the islands themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Cancers can occur because growth promoting genes are activated or tumor suppressing genes are inactivated.</strong> DNA methylation is inversely proportional to regulate gene expression. Promoter hypermethylation plays a major role in cancer development by transcriptionally silencing critical growth regulators such as tumor suppressor genes. <span> Gene silencing by hypermethylation causes tumor development/progression.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CpG methylation, accounts at least in part for the age-dependent appearance of many  disease state</strong>s other than cncer including hypertension, diabetic neuropathic changes and degenerative arthritis. </span></p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated</strong>. Current research indicates that the <strong>probable function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity</strong>. Without having DNA methylation at these intergenic regions there is a greater susceptibility for insertions and reciprocal translocations. In repetitive elements DNA silencing prevents transposition. Methylation of repeats may prevent recombination in an illegitimate fashion. This also prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disruption of intergenic DNA methylation contributes to disease in the following ways:</strong></p>
<p>1)        Repetitive elements are overexpressed.</p>
<p>2)        Strong promoter regions associated with the repetitive elements may cause the expression of downstream genes (transcriptional disruption) that might not otherwise be normally expressed.</p>
<p>3)        The repetitive elements may disrupt the presence of the normal genes when those elements are inserted in the middle of a genomic sequence.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Genomic imprinting</strong><span> determines</span><span> which g</span>enes<span> can be expressed </span><span>in a p</span>arent<span>-of-origin-specific manner. </span></p>
<p>H19 and IGF2 are genes which are  related to cell growth and have opposite effects.  Mothers try to protect themselves and preserve themselves for future pregnancies (H19 expression),  The paternal allele is designed to promote bigger offspring (IGF2 expression). Mostly<strong> IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele</strong>; H19 is expressed from the maternal allele. <span>. <strong>Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent</strong> while <strong>the maternal copy is hypomethylated  and expressed</strong>. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression</span> </p>
<p><span>Loss of imprinting (LOI) is the most common molecular abnormality in Wilms’ tumor (WT). LOI in WT involves activation of the normally silent maternal allele of the </span><em>insulin-like growth factor-II</em><span> (</span><em>IGF2</em><span>) gene, I</span>n some Wilms tumors the transcriptionally silent maternal IGF2 allele is activated such that IGF2 expression occurs biallelically.</p>
<p><span>In Russell-Silver Disease there is  hypomethylation of <em>H19 </em>and IGF2 which leads to growth retardation. <strong>In Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome the opposite occurs and there is hypermethylation of these genes leading to unchecked growth on tumor formation. </strong></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine) is a nucleoside  that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA. <span>inhibitors of DNA methylation can reverse epigenetic changes in a number of target genes that have a role in the development and/or progression of certain tumors. <span>Treatment with inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation can reactivate epigenetically silenced genes and has been shown to restore normal gene function. In cancer cells, this results in expression of tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory functions, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter cells and potentially on to future generations until erased.  Therapies desigend to modify the epigenome can have a lasting effect on the susceptibility of cells to therapies directed at disease.</p>
<p>DNA demethylation occurs in early development, in primordial germ cell development, and at later specific differentiation stages. This is mitotically heritable and originally thought to be irremovable except by failure to maintain methylation by DNMT1.<span> It is generally believed that these  early life periods  constitute  times during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. During these periods epigenetic marks are laid down. These marks are meitotically heritable and will be transferred not only to daughter cells but potentially to future generations. Interference with nomal cell development at these critical periods may affect not only the individual, setting him/her up for a lifelong susceptibility to disease but also unborn generations and is therefore inadvisable.</span></p></div>
