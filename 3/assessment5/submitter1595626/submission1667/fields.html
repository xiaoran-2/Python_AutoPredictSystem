    <h1>Submission 1667 from Anon (session_user_id: 31287246facbb8e8dbb55aa7618dd59c789c6d6c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of two FDA approved drugs from the group of DNA-demethylating agents, currently available on market under name "Dacogen" produced by Japanesse company Eisai. DNA metyltransferases (DNMT) inhibitors are analogues of nucleosides, which act in replication-dependent manner. Agents are firstly incorporated to DNA and than act on DNA metyltrasferases and inhibit them by creating an irreversible bond. Details of this mechanism are not yet fully understood. Anyhow, Decitabine was proved to act as an effective inhibitor of DNMTs, reversing epigenetic changes in myeloblastic syndromes, which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation on sites of imprinted control regions (ICRs) can lead to changes in imprinting patterns. This process is well described for H19/Igf2 cluster. Under normal conditions ICR region of the cluster is methylated only on one of inherrited chromosomes (paternal). Unmetylated ICR region of the other chromosome is availble for binding with CTCF and the corresponding enhancers regulate the expression of H19 gene. Igf2 gene remain not expressed. Alelle on paternal chromosome contain methylated ICR which is not accessible by CTCF. Enhancers in this case regulate expression of Igf2 gene instead of H19, which remains unexpressed. In disease condition - in Wilm's tumor - ICR region of this cluster is methylated on both alleles. Enhancers than regulate expression of Igf2 on both chromosomes. This results in double dose of transcript comparing to normal condition, contributing to pathology of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Research group of Dr. Baylin studied effects of combined treatment with histone-deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and DNA-demethylating agent on tumor growth in lung cancer patients. Some of the patients in the study didn't react to the treatment itself, but later showed exceptionally good response to chemoterapy. This is a promissing concept. Epigenetic marks, once established are stable and passed to subsequent populations of cells via cell division. If this specific marks are erased or altered, for example due to changes in DNA methylation or HDACs by targeted treatment, this changes will be passed to following generations as well. Chemoterapheutical treatment would be than targeted on smaller population of cancer cells, therefore can be more efficient. Although this a very exciting possibility, using a treatment targeting epigenetical marks has to be timed correctly. Similar treatemnt could have horrible effects during sensitive periods of development with increased sensitivity to regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. This includes periods such as gametogenesis, post-fertilization period (treatment during pregnancy), differentiation of hematopoetic progenitors and early post-natal life. Due to increased sensitivity to changes, targeted treatment could alter development of whole cell lines or organs with ultimate consequences. </p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells are generally characterized by genome-wide loss and regional gain in DNA methylation. This includes mainly changes in methylation patterns on CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG islands are characterized by sequence of cytosine preceding guanine, where cytosine is easy to be methylated. CpG islands are present in more than half of promoters and are associated with silencing. Under normal conditions CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, leaving genes they regulate active. In case of a cancer cell, cytosines of the islands are hypermethylated leading to silencing of corresponding downstream genes. These are often tumor supressor genes, whose deactivation contribute to cancer pathology. These changes are mitotically heritable and increase with time and age. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is very common in different types of cancer, such as retinoblastoma (on RB gene), breast cancer (gene BRCA) or colorectal cancer (MLH1). Due to their sensitive detection, notable differences in methylation pattern of CpG islands are often used as a biomarker for tumor identification, survival prognosis or choice of treatment employed. Similar, but reversed pattern of changes in DNA methylation is observed at sites of introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements as LINES, SINES or satelite repeats. These segments of the genome are hypermethylated under normal conditions. This serves as a mechanism of protection against transcriptional noise from alternative starting sites, antisence transcription or alternative splicing. In cancer cells, on the contrary, we observe hypomethylation of these regions resulting in changes in genes expression further contributing to disease pathology. </p></div>
