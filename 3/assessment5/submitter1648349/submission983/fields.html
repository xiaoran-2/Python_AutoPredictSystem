    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a part of cellular epigenetic machinery where methyltransferases catalyse the addition of a methyl-group at cytocines in CG dinucleotides. CpG islands are g<span>enomic regions that contain a high frequency of CG dinucleotides and are mostly unmethylated in normal cells</span>. CpG islands are found: <strong>a</strong>. in about 60% of promoters and are methylated at promoters of silenced genes (thus contributing to heterochromatin formation), <strong>b</strong>. in some intergenic regions and <strong>c</strong>. at repetitive DNA. In this way DNA methylation regulates the expression of imprinted genes, minimizes transcription of transposable elements, represses transcriptional noise from alternative start sites which can be found into intergenic regions, helps at X-chromosome inactivation and prevents recipropal translocations.</p>
<p>DNA methylation patterns are disrupted in cancerogenesis procedure in two different manners. We observe: </p>
<ul><li>DNA hypermethylation at specific loci, namely CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes </li>
<li>Genome-wide DNA hypomethylation</li>
</ul><p>The disturbance of methylation profile unsettles the balance between proteins that induce and proteins that supress cellular proliferation. Hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes sliences them transcriptionally thus leading to increased cellular proliferation due to aberrant oncoprotein exrpession. Those epimutations cause arrest of differentiation and can accelarate tumor growth and further malignant transformation. Alongside, global DNA hypomethylation allows activation of repetitive DNA elements, enhancing their mutagenic potential and providing sites for recipropal translocations as these repeats are dispersed into the genome. Moreover, there is a loss of imprinting pattens and overproduction of some transcription factors that lead to genomic instablity. Alternative transcription start sites and splicing donor/acceptor sites are revealed following demethylation of intergenic regions.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that each type of cancer has a different, unique disturbed methylation profile so different pharmaceutical approaches are used.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>H19 contains a differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region (ICR). This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. </span>The ICR of IGF2/H19 locus is unmethylated on the maternal allele and is bound by the CTCF insulator protein which isolates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, blocking its expression.These enhancers act on H19 lncRNA and enhance H19 expression only from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele ICR is methylated and thus cannot bind CTCF. The enhancers act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression only from the paternal allele. H19 is inactive on the paternal allele as the ICR downstream into the H19 promoter is part of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is characterized by loss of IGF2/H19 locus imprinting. The maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off. In both alleles Igf2 is expressed, resulting in double transcripts compared to a normal cell This means that the cell receive a stronger growth signal, something which promotes tumor growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (<span>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, <span>trade name Dacogen</span>)</span> is an epigenetic drug that acts as a <span>DNA-demethylating agent which is commonly used in some types of leukemias. It is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase 1, preventing the addition of methylgroups at CpG regions.</span></p>
<p>Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analog that  bounds irreversibly on  DNMT1, upon DNA replication. As a consequence, aberrantly silenced<br />genes, including tumor suppressor genes, can be reactivated and expressed.It has been shown to induce hematological remissions in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>The anti tumor effect of decitabine is based on the fact that <span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to new cells until they are actively erased. In this way reactivated genes can slow down tumor progression inducing differentiation of leukemic cells in mature types not only at the morphological but also at the functional level</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells DNA methylation patterns are disrupted as DNA is hypermethylated at specific loci, including tumor suppressor genes, whereas genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is observed. Those events synergistically lead to accelaration of cell cycle and imply further malignant transformation.Epigenetic changes driven by drugs such as azacytidine and decitabine are passed on during cell division to new cells. Considering that cancer cells divide consistently, DNA hypomethylation caused by those chemical substances is continuously inheritied to newly formed cells until signs of hypermethylation are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are defined as periods of extensive epigenetic reprogramming and establishment of epigenetic marks. These procedure allows differential gene expression that leads to cell differentiation. Epigenetic reprogramming occurs during primordial and germ cell development, and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Patients should be avoid treated with DNA demethylating agents can affect the establishment of epigenetic marks during sensitive periods as this could cause uncontrolled activation of repetitive DNA, loss of impriting and perturbation of normal cell differentiation. Thus it could provide a selective advantage to cancer cells instead of reducing its proloferative potential.</p>
