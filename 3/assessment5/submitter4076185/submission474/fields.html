    <div class="field-value"><p>The main role of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>The genome is composed of repetitive elements, intergenic regions, introns, genes and gene promoters in which CpG islands can be found.</p>
<p>Each of these regions can be methylated or unmethylated: methylation stands for gene silencing, whereas unmethylation stands for gene expression.</p>
<p> In normal cells CpG islands are in general not methylated allowing gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated in comparison with normal cells, which leads to gene silencing.</p>
<p>These hypermethylated CpG islands when located in the tumour suppressor gene promoters do not allow the expression of tumour suppressor factors, therefore the cells with this epimutation are less likely to die and may divide more rapidly than normal cells resulting in cancer tissue.</p>
<p>In normal cells the DNA intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are most often methylated while in cancer cells these are more likely to be hypomethylated. These regions being hypomethylated mare made up of more open chromatin than they should normally be. This open conformation allows mistakes to occur more easily than in heterochromatin. The mistakes can be deletions of chromosome parts, insertions or reciprocal translocations, all leading to genetic instability.</p>
<p>Different types of cancer can be caused by these two modifications being one implicated at a higher rate than the other. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One common feature in cancer is the loss of imprinting: genes that should display monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression end up being expressed or silenced in both parental alleles.</p>
<p>This loss of imprinting occurs as result of methylation abnormalities at the ICRs. These modifications often cause cancer since a lot of imprinted gens are associated with growth.</p>
<p>Taking the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example, in normal cells the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal one. The methylation on the paternal allele spreads to the H19 gene silencing it. Therefore the enhancers only act on the Igf2 gene allowing its expression. On the maternal the ICR is unmethylated allowing the CTCF insulator element to bind it, preventing Igf2 from being expressed. Thus the enhancers only act on the H19.</p>
<p>If loss of imprinting occurs, as in Wilm’s tumour, both alleles have ICRs methylated and therefore the enhancers will act on the Igf2 permitting its expression in both alleles whereas the H19 is silenced. The Igf2 is then expressed twice as much as in normal cells and being it a growth promoter a tumour will eventually develop.</p>
<p>Both alleles can also be unmethylated causing cells to express twice as much of H19 and no Igf2 causing Silver-Russell Syndrome characterized by growth retardation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer is hypermethylation of CpG islands located at tumour suppressor gene promoters. The hypermethylation results in gene suppression and deregulation of the cell’s activity.</p>
<p>The economist article refers to decitabine as a DNA-demethylating agent; this means it removes DNA methylation. Decitabine is administrated to patients suffering from myelodisplatic syndrome (MDS) inhibiting DNMT and causing DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>The DNA being demethylated allows the tumour suppressor genes to be expressed again, restoring the normal cellular growth and dividing activity.</p>
<p>Since the epigenetic marks are inherited mitotically the changes caused by the drug to a cell will be passed on to its offspring which will now express the genes that were silenced before the drug administration.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs used by Dr Baylin act on the epigenome removing DNA methylation (azacitidine) and inhibiting histone deacetylation. These two epigenetic modifications caused by the drugs lead to tumour suppressor gene expression and therefore restore the cells normal growth and division.</p>
<p>However the drugs action is not restricted to the cancer cells and other genes that were rightly suppressed can become active. Knowing that all epigenetic modifications made to a person’s cells will be maintained through mitosis, these drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods. These refer to periods during embryogenesis and germ cell development when epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed and if disrupted may cause problems such as genetic diseases and infertility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these drugs if given to patients out of these crucial periods, the modifications carried out by them prevail through mitosis and may have enduring effects, perhaps even facilitation the action of other drugs.</p></div>
