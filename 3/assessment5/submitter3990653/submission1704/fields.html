    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p>DNA methylation is a modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC), and is found in approximately 70-80 % of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells. CpG islands are found in about 60 % of promoters, and are usually kept free of methylation, independent of their activity state. (Hassler, 2012).</p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which represses transcription of the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes leading to gene silencing.</p>
<p>DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</p>
<p>Global hypomethylation has also been recognized as a cause of oncogenesis. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting.</p>
</div>
<p>In a cancer cell the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The consequences are genomic instability for example: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal IGF2  genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele (filled circles). In the maternal allele H19 genes are expressed and the sites upstream of H19 are unmethylated (open circles).</p>
<p>In tumours with lost of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth.  Lost of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome. (<a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079">http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/model-of-loss-of-imprinting-of-igf2-38079</a>).</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumor.</p>
<p>Mono-allelic expression of imprinted genes depends on whether the gene is inherited from the mother or the father. This remarkable pattern of expression is controlled by specialized sequence elements called ICRs (imprinting control regions). ICRs are marked by DNA methylation on one of the two parental alleles. These allelic marks originate from either the maternal or the paternal germ line. Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>5-Aza-2’-deoxycitidine (decitabine) is an epigenetic drug that act as a  DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation, which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. (Mazin-Al-Zalihi, 2011). At low doses, favor the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMT), causing hypomethylations of DNA.</p>
<p>In neoplastic cells decitabine induced hypomethylation and may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. Decitabine can slow progression of MDS and chronic or acute myeloid leukemias. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the  incorporations of its metabolit 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine triphosphate (ZdC), into DNA. ZdC is a “suicide” substrate which covalently inactivates DNMT. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.(<a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=acaf6e50-7cd3-4431-98ef-d1c07e3ed8c2#section-10">http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=acaf6e50-7cd3-4431-98ef-d1c07e3ed8c2#section-10</a>).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is no significant variation in DNA methylation between tissues within an animal, this indicates that DNA methylation marks were established in the early embryonic stem cells probably before the developing embryo implanted in the womb. (Waterland and Jirtle, Mol. Cell. Biol. 23: 5293-5300, 2003).</p>
<p>This epigenetic regulation of genes acquired during early development is inherited not only during cell division (mitotic inheritance), but it also can be passed on from one generation to the next (meiotic inheritance). For that reason modifications in DNA methylation can be passed on the offpring.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming. When epigenetic reprogramming occurs, importantly epigenetic marks are reeestablished post-implantation.</p>
<p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are the early development and the preconception period.</p>
<p>But, other windows of susceptibility to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations may be longer, such as early childhood development and puberty. Once these epigenetic marks are established, however, the effects on the individual remain throughout life, and can even potentially be passed on to future generations through the egg and the sperm.</p>
<p>Pacients treated during sensitive periods can induce epigenetic alterations, but these effects during young child, and a pregnant woman aren’ t know. But it’ s possible that this have serious effects  to the fetus in pregnant woman and effects in the development of a child.</p></div>
