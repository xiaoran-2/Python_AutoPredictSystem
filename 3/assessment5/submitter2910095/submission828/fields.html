    <div class="field-value"><p>In general methylation of CpG islands in mammals causes silencing of nearby genes and may have developed as a defence against parasitic DNA elements. The methylated cytosine at position 5 can spontaneously deaminate (or through point mutation) to thymine and although 5-methylcytosine represents only around 1% of all bases in the human genome its potential as a mutagenic hazard is high as indicated by its involvement in around one third of all point mutations causing human genetic disorders. Despite this disadvantage, it is a requirement for life not only affecting gene expression but also embryogenesis, telomere length and chromosome stability.</p>
<p>In cancer, whilst globally the amount of methylation of cytosine decreases, promoter associated CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated with affected genes being permanently silenced and this epigenetic change is passed on during mitosis and maintained in the malignant clone. Thousands of genes may be silenced by this hypermethylation in cancer but it is only the silencing of tumour suppressor genes coupled with increased genetic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes that is important. Depending on the level of hypermethylation measured, which can vary between individuals, it is possible to determine likely prognosis (e.g. probability to metastasise),efficacy and response to therapy. </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to promote genome stability. Hypomethylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive regions in cancer causing genomic instability through deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR's) act to supress/silence either the gene on the maternal or paternal allele with the H19/Igf2 cluster being a well studied example. In this case the expression of the maternal Igf2 gene is silenced. In normal cells only the paternal ICR is methylated which prevents binding of CTFC to the ICR allowing enhancers to act on the paternal Igf2 gene allowing its expression. On the maternal allele the lack of methylation allows CTFC to bind to the ICR and insulate it from the enhancers preventing expression of maternal Igf2 and forcing the enhancers to act on H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour both the paternal and maternal ICR at this cluster is methylated. This allows both Igf2 alleles to be expressed through prevention of CTFC binding. As Igf2 (insulin growth factor 2) is a growth promoting gene, this "double dose" causes excessive growth and is associated with Wilm's tumour a childhood nephroblastoma (kidney tumour).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabane is a DNA demethylating agent. In other words it "decreases" the hypermethylation seen in cancers through removal of methylation altering gene expression within the cell. By removal of methylation that is blocking the expression of tumour suppression genes it can be used to treat cancer. A potential advantage is that it may be possible to treat the cancer without killing the cell as changes to the epigenome can be passed on mitotically.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects as the epigenome is passed on in mitosis so the "altered" epigenome is inherited by the daughter cell. Whilst perhaps this should be considered a benefit of treatment in certain circumstances this might be detrimental if these drugs are given during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is when the environment may be able to effect the epigenome during a period of epigenetic reprogramming or active remodelling. The two recognised most sensitive periods are the period of primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature gametes and pre-implantation to early implantation of the embryo.</p>
<p>During these sensitive periods through altering of the environment (in this case use of an epigenetic drug) may have an effect on epigenetic control and these effects could be trangenerational (e.g. inherited).</p></div>
