    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal state, in general, CpG islands are not methylated, enabling normal transcription &amp; gene expression for the genes associated with the promoter next to the CpG island.  This should result in healthy cellular functioning &amp; maintenance of genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer, various locus specific CpG islands become progressively hypermethylated, which will effectively silence associated genes (often tumor suppressor genes), &amp; thus a lack of tumor suppression enables cellular proliferation. This may be 1 factor contributing to development of cancer.  Different tumor types may be hypermethylated at different sets of CpG islands, resulting in silencing of different genes.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of  CpG islands may contribute to the proliferation of growth factors and/or a lack of growth       suppression (silenced tumor suppressors), enabling cells to grow in an uncontrolled manner &amp; not dieing as much.  Silencend gene expression may be responsible for producing key proteins or performing various repair functions, such as mismatch repair or DNA repair, that create additional cellular disruption, leading to cancer.</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up of Intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements, which are normally methylated, with a silencing of expression of cryptic promoter or cryptic splice sites, in order to maintain genomic stability &amp; integrity.      </p>
<p>In cancer, these areas become globally hypomethylated &amp; the chromatin structure may become more open &amp; accessible to illegitimate recombination.  The repeats can replicate &amp; jump into other parts of the genome, resulting in mutagenic transpositions, inappropriate activation of genes, generating deletions, insertions, or duplications of chromosomes.</p>
<p>In general, hypomethylated repeats or intergenic regions can cause genomic instability  Activation of previously silenced Long Terminal repeats (with a strong promoter) can cause the read out of  downstream genes and transcription of neighboring genes that are not  supposed to be.  Any of these  disruptions can contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated, as well as the H19 promoter.  The downstream enhancers are able to access Igf2 to activate it.</p>
<p>Normally, an insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele.  The downstream enhancers activate H19 &amp; Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting on the maternal allele &amp; the ICR becomes hypermethylated.  CTCF will not bind, and the downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it.  This results in a double dosage of Igf2, which is growth promoting, as both paternal &amp; maternal alleles are able to act on Igf2.  Without counterbalancing of growth inhibition, a tumor can result.</p>
<p>Alterations in normal DNA methylation at the H19/Igf2 cluster result in disrupted imprinting, causing an overexpression or underexpression of growth promoting genes, &amp; non-optimal cellular growth patterns.  An overexpression is a common, early event in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, inducing demethylation.  It gets incorporated into the DNA.  During replication, when it is time for the daughter strand to receive the same methylation as the parent strand, the DNMT1 (methyltransferase) binds to the nucleotide in an irreversible manner, unable to release.  Subsequent cellular divisions, result in depletion of cellular DNA methyltransferase &amp; eventual cellular death.</p>
<p>Decitabine is dependent upon cellular division &amp; since cancer cells tend to divide more rapidly than normal cells, the DNA methyltransferase inhibition is thought to effect these cells more than others.  Eventually, the DNA methyltransferase is depleted to the point of cell death, killing the tumor cells.  Since this drug effects all dividing cells, it is not known what the long term consequences to normal cells will be, as every cell divides at some point, &amp; would ultimately be effected.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, epigenetic mutations can impact subsequent cellular divisions, causing propagation of overexpression, underexpression or inappropriate gene expression, development of genomic instability &amp; possibly even death, depending on the timing, location &amp; frequency of these changes.  It is believed that some of these epigenetic mutations can be altered, such as via DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.  Subsequent cellular divisions would then propogate those drug-induced changes to the daughter cells, resulting in an enduring impact on the epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when an altered environment could have an effect on epigenetic control,<span>predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks</span>, such as during pre-implantation &amp; early post-implantation, and during primordial germ cell development thru to the gametes.  I would avoid treatment perhaps 2 months prior to conception, during pregnancy, &amp; in young children thru puberty, particularly young girls, whose gametes have not matured.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs during a sensitive period could alter epigenetic marks transmitted from parent to offspring (via the gametes), possibly altering gene expression patterns.  Developing embryos might suffer incomplete epigenetic reprogramming, epimutations, or even death during this time.  It's unclear the full extent of the impact of treatment during this time, but likely would be sub-optimal.</p>
