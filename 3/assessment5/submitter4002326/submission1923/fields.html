    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation of the DNA in islands CPG plays an important role in the regulation of the expression of genes.  Two classes of epigenéticas modifications in the methylation can take place: hipomethylation and hipermethylation. The hipermethylation has an extremely high importance in islands CPG (more of 60% of these they are in promoters). The hipermethylation implies an increase in the amount of groups methyl (- CH3) in the dinucleotides CPG. The hipomethylation consists of an abnormal reduction of the amount of groups awaited methyls (referencing them to normal cells).</p>
<p>The increase of the methylation in islands CPG leads to gene silencing of genes suppresors of tumors (example, gene P161NK4a). The methylation of the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is fundamental to assure the stability and genetic integrity.</p>
<p>In the case of the intergenic regions, the genomic instability can be translated in: deletions, insertions, uniform duplications of whole chromosomes; as well as displacement between the chromosomes, can even be generated interference transcriptional.</p>
<p>As far as the repetitive elements, we remember that normally they later make copies of themselves being silenced by the methylation, avoiding therefore the recombination illegitimate.  But the hipomethylation takes place the chromatin is not so compact and therefore it can be transcriptionally active, giving rise to the illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In the cancer, both regions are hypomethylated in comparison with normal cells and can foment the formation and progression of the tumors. Some of the regulating regions of genes that show hipomethylation are correlated to the increases in the transcription. The hipomethylation and the overexpression of some printed genes, including the IGF-2 and H19, genes implied in the carcinogenesis, and the consequence not less important of the protein on-expression certain involved in the invasion processes and metastasis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, Igf2 gene expression is silenced in the maternal allele, while H19 is silenced in the paternal allele. In mice that allele-specific expression is associated with allele-specific DNA methylation in various differentially methylated regions (DMR) in the Igf2 gene and the control region IGF2/H19 printing (ICR) located immediately downstream above the H19 promoter. ICR contains four CCCTC binding factor methylation sensitive (CTCF) binding sites that mediate the assembly of a chromatin insulator that blocks the interactions between the promoter and enhancers Igf2 downstream H19 gene. In the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF ICR joins silencing Igf2 expression and stimulation of transcription of H19. But if the impression is lost or interrupted either by displacement particular by DNA methylation, we can find an over-expression of IGF 2 and the interruption of the expression of CDKN 1 c, a tumor suppressor. But in addition to this cancellation, which is a gene Igf2 growth animator, surely you will get cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Classes of drugs distinas epigenetic inhibitors (inhibitors of histone desatecilasa inhibitors of histone methyltransferase, etc..), Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. By inducing DNA demethylation can lead to re-express genes silenced and consequently make them to normal levels of CpG island methylation. This of course is possible because epigenetic changes hypermethylation in CPG islands, are reversible.</p>
<p>The consequence of this is that by eliminating the hypermethylation of CpG islands (gene silencing) allows the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes and thus its antitumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First we must know in clearly what we understand per sensible period. A sensible period is a period of epigenética reprogramming; the clearing and replacement of the epigenéticas marks. So the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms seems to be one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period. These are the periods when we seem to, that they seem to be most sensitive to changes in the environment. However, when we're in the somatic maintenance period is less sensitive. Precisely in this period there is a tendency to see altered DNA methylation, but this alteration can print disorders. Of course, it would be advisable to treat sensitive periods, since it is possible to eliminate the alterations in methylation of the cell and therefore mitotically avoid being copied.</p></div>
