    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">A normal cell, usually shows hypomethylation at the CpG islands and methylation at the repetitive elements, intergenic an intragenic regions (introns) allowing the gene expression to occur as required to each cell type. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In cancer, <span style="color:#000000;">characteristics such as patient age, gender, and specific genetic mutations increase epigenomic alterations.  The hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands contributes to the disease by  silencing of tumor suppressor genes, controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  This cancer feature may be usefull for diagnosis, prognosis or monitor tumors, and to different tumor types is already possible to describe CIMPs-the CpG island methylator phenotype that is characterized by DNA hypermethylation in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes with silencing of transcription.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">Other epigenetic alterations such as  hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, leads to the activation of repeats, transposons, cryptic promoters and neighbouring genes, and reciprocal translocations, insertions or deletions may occur, contributing to the general genome instability, characteristic in cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In normal, imprinted cells, genes is usually expressed by a monoallelyc parent specific way.  In cancer, the alteration of DNA methylation at the imprinted control regions- ICRs- causes loss of imprinting.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In the  normal IGF2/H19 cluster, the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, allowing the enhancers near by to act on the h</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">uman insulin-like growth factor II gene</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;">-</span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">IGF2- that is so, expressed from paternal allele. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">On the maternal allele differently, the ICR is unmethylated, and CTCF will bind his insulator element, and the enhancers won't reach IGF2 gene. This enhancers will act on H19, expressing this gene, but the IGF2 will be silent on the maternal allele, so not expressed.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="color:#000000;">On Wilm's tumor, this imprinting pattern is lost. Happens a hypermethylation of the ICR on BOTH maternal and paternal alleles. Now, in both alleles the enhancers will act on the IGF2 gene an both alleles will express this gene. Now we have a double dose of IGF2, comparing to a normal cell.  As IGF2 is a growth promoter, this mechanism will increase the growth rate of  Wilm's tumor, a child hood kidney tumor.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">The Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that progress to AML. It is an epigenetic inhibitor from the class of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors- DNMTi. This drug has a huge effect on DNA methylation because acts directly on <em>de novo</em> methyltranseferases- DNMTs- that are responsable to mantain the DNA methylation state during cell division. This action is possible because Decitabine is composed of nucleoside analogs that are incorporated to the cell DNA. When in contact with DNMT this incorporeted analogs will bind irreversibly to the enzime, preventing their  fuction. This way, the drug prevents the transmition of cancer-caused epigenetic alterations during the cancer  uncontrolled cell division. It has an important effect on the methylation pattern found on the CpG islands, often related to growth promotion factors, which can contribute to an important anti-tumor effect.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="western"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Epigenetic drugs grants enduring benefit by altering the DNA methylation in some cells, what  stabilish the pattern that will be copied to all daugther cells on further cell divisions. It happens due to the function of  <em>de novo</em> methyltranseferases-DNMTs. They act on de DNA replication process, when each strand of the DNA serves as a template to the production of a complementary strand. DNMTs  lay down the DNA methylation pattern on the daugther strand exactly as found on the template strand, restablishing the symmetrical DNA methylation of the dinucleotides in the double strand DNA. This way, the epigenetic marks are passed by between cells on a tissue, but this marks must be erased when is time to produce a completly new organism. So that, the epigenetic process has sensitive periods when the existing epigenetic marks are erased and reprogramed  to reestablish pluripotency: The early embrio development, after fertilization and before blastocist; and the primordial germ cells development to produce gametes. The administration of epigenetic drugs on this sensitive periods are inadvisable, because the epigenetic marks are going to be erased during this periods, and also is not known if this drugs may lead to mistakes during epigenetic reprogramming.</span></span></span></p></div>
