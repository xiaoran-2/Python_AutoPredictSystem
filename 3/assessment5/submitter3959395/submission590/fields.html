    <div class="field-value"><p>    DNA methylation (the addition of a methyl group to the DNA) predominantly occurs at symmetrical CpGs in somatic cells although non-CpG methylation has also been detected in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The major biological function of methylation is to inactivate the X chromosome in females, regulate genomic imprinting and maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>   The majority of CpG islands is normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become methylated in various cell types and pathological situations.</p>
<p>   So, in a normal cells the CpG island are hypomethylated, but genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic.</p>
<p>In contrast, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased.</p>
<p>   Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes. This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>  Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in other parts of the genome leads to chromosome instability due to mechanisms such as loss of imprinting and reactivation of transposable elements. </p>
<p>  In cancer cells “global hypomethylation” due to disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) may promote mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, ultimately resulting in aneuploidy when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during mitosis.</p>
<p>When mutation results in loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive. Single base pair mutations during replication can also have detrimental effects.</p>
<p>  In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with global hypomethylation of repeat-rich intergenic regions and hypermethylation of a subset of CpG-dense gene-associated regions (CpG islands).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     The ICR at IGF2 and H19 is normally methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the IGF2 promoters to the enhancers downstream of the H19 gene . This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables IGF2 expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers.</p>
<p>    Higher order chromatin structure at the locus differs between maternal and paternal alleles and that on the maternal allele CTCF mediates a looping structure that sequesters the enhancers away from the Igf2 promoters.</p>
<p>     About half of Wilm’s tumour with normal imprinting of IGF2  showed aberrant methylation of the H19 DMR. This is consistent with the idea that aberrant methylation is necessary but not sufficient, and that CTCF is only one of several factors involved in the disruption of genomic imprinting in cancer.</p>
<p>     Disruption of methylation patterns at imprinted loci resulting in loss of imprinting (LOI) may lead to serious imprinting disorders and is described in  Wilms' tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitidine (SGI-110) is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug and  "demethylation" and an "antimetabolite" agent.</p>
<p> Decitabine causes DNA demethylation and they get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p>
<p> Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells. </p>
<p> Reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation and associated gene silencing is an attractive cancer therapy approach.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>    The periods that are actually sensitive to epigenetic control and to changes in the environment, are called “sensitive periods”. <br />There are: the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms,<br />pre implanted and early post implantation period. And optionally periods that are called the “slow growth periods”.<br />  The epigenome refers to the overall epigenetic state of a cell, and serves as an interface between the environment and the genome. The epigenome is dynamic and responsive to environmental signals not only during development, but also throughout life; and it is becoming increasingly apparent that pharmaceutical drugs can cause changes in gene expression that persist long after exposure has ceased. <br />   Drugs may alter epigenetic homeostasis by direct or indirect mechanisms. Direct effects may be caused by drugs which affect chromatin architecture or DNA methylation (for example, the antihypertensive hydralazine inhibits DNA methylation). <br />   Drag stimulation results in the altered expression of receptors, signaling molecules, and other proteins necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. With more chronic exposure, cells adapt by an unknown hypothetical process that results in more permanent<br />modifications to DNA methylation and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, any epigenetic side-effect caused by a drug may persist after the drug is discontinued.</p></div>
