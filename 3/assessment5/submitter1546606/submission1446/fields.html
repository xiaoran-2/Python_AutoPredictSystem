    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG nucleotides are found in clusters or islands in many gene promoters, and also without clustering in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>CpG island-rich promoters are normally not methylated, allowing the gene they promote to be expressed. If the promoters are normally methylated, the gene they promote is silenced in normal cells, such as in imprint control regions (ICR). In cancer, unmethylated regions can become hypermethylated, silencing genes that are normally active. Methylated regions can become hypomethylated, allowing a normally silenced gene to be expressed. This can contribute to disease by silencing tumor suppresor genes and allowing oncogenes to be expressed.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements silences cryptic promoters and transposable elements found in these regions. These can become hypomethylated in cancer, allowing cryptic promoters to become active. This affects the expression of nearby genes, and allows transposable elements to become active and jump around in the genome. This causes genomic instability through translocation, insertion and deletion.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele for the H19/lgf2 cluster ICR is methylated and expresses lgf2. Enhancers promote expression of lgf2 because methylation at the insulator protein CTCF binding site and the H19 promoter allows them to bypass H19 and promote expression of lgf2.</p>
<p>The maternal allele for the H19/lgf2 cluster is unmethylated and expresses H19. The CTCF binding site is not methylated, so CTCF binds and insulates lgf 2 from the enhancers. The H19 promoter is not methylated, so this gene is expressed and its expression is promoted by the enhancers.</p>
<p>In cancer, both alleles can become methylated. This results in H19 not being expressed at all, and lgf2 being overexpressed as it is being expressed from both alleles. As lgf2 is a growth factor, it acts as an oncogene and can contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, which interferes with an enzyme that methylates DNA. It gradually removes methylation from DNA by preventing methyl marks being laid down when new strands of DNA are created during mitosis. Decitabine could have an anti-tumor effect if it was used on a cancer driven by hypermethylation, as it would reduce the amount of methylation that the cancer depends on. (For example, it could remove methylation from CpG islands in promoters, and possibly reactive silenced tumor suppressor genes.)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are passed down through mitosis to the following generation of cells. This means that any cells created by mitosis after the treatment are epigentically different from those before treatment and so may respond differently. </p>
<p>A "sensitive period" is one when major changes in the epigenome - epigenetic reprogramming - are taking place. The two main sensitive periods are during the early development of the embryo before differentiation, and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>If a patient were treated with an epigenetic agent during a sensitive period it could interfere with normal epigenetic programming and any abnormal epigenetic state caused by that interference would then be permanent as the changes are mitotically heritable.</p></div>
