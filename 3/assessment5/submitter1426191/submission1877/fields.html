    <h1>Submission 1877 from Anon (session_user_id: f5d594a378d9672d82351f40436cbee84a973d26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug which acts as a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor, and results in DNA hypomethylation. As hypomethylation of CpG islands is a hallmark of cancer and is believed to be involved in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes, inhibiting the excessive laying down of DNA methylation or preventing it to be transferred to daughter cells can bring about normal expression of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in a large percent of gene promoters. DNA methylation of these CGIs is negatively correlated with the expression of the corresponding gene, that is - hypermethylation of CGIs is related to gene silencing. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes can result in low expression or silencing of these tumour suppressor genes, therefore harming the ability to suppress tumourgenesis. Hypomethylation of normally methylated promoters, especially those associated with oncogenes, can result in activation of genes which have an advert affect and can promote tumour creation. Hypermetylation can spread easily since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and is probably rapidly selected for.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements is believed to maintain genomic integrity and stability by silencing cryptic antisense start sites or splice sites, which could otherwise result in transcription interruptions or undesired splicing, and by preventing transposition of repeats, incorrect recombination due to repeats, and transcriptional interference due to the fact that these repeats are sometime strong promoters. One of the hallmarks of cancer is hypomethylation in these regions. Hypometylation of the usually silenced repeats means that these can jump to other locations resulting in undesired recombination and potential interference of desired gene transcription. Similarly, the now active intragenic regions can harm stability by interfering transcription and undesired splicing.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/lgf2 cluster is paternally imprinted in healthy somatic cells, i.e. - the ICR in the paternal allele is methylated. When unmethylated, CTCF can bind to this ICR. Methylation of the ICR blocks CTCF from binding, resulting in the spreading of the methylation to the H19 promoter. With the H19 silenced, downstream enhancers instead act on lgf2, hence causing lgf2 expression. When the ICR in unmethylated, as happens on the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the ICR and insulates the lgf2 gene from the downstream enhancer via expression of H19. Therefore, in a healthy cell lgf2 is expressed from the paternal allele only and H19 is active only on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumour due to the fact that the ICR of this cluster is methylated in both alleles causing lgf2 to be overexpressed. Since lgf2 promotes growth, an overdose of it can result in tumourgenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable thanks to the activity of DNMT1, which acts on the hemi-methylated strand in the daughter cell. Therefore, methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome. If de novo laying down of methylation is disrupted during development periods when this mark is established, or if DNMT1 is inhibited later on - methylation will not occur or will not be maintained. By contrast, inhibition of demethylating agents during reprogramming will not allow the methylation to be cleared and can disrupt germ genesis etc.</p>
<p>Epigenetically sensitive periods are stages in which the cell undergoes epigenetic reprogramming. Clearing marks that should not be cleared of retaining marks that should be cleared will have advert and enduring effects. Such sensitive period are the pre implantation stage of the embryo and the primordial germ cell development period. These are both times were epigenetic reprogramming occurs.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, epigenetically sensitive periods are those stages in which reprogramming occurs. Therefore, drugs that alter methylation might have negative effects - marks might not be cleared or reset as needed</p>
