    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. CpG islands have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. In Cancer cells, a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue speciﬁc and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is usually found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, helping maintain genomic integrity.  In cancer cells, hypomethylation in those area causes genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting, a process that causes genes to be expressed according to their parental origin. disordered imprinting is implicated in genetic disease and in many cancers. The most common explanation for reciprocal imprinting of IGF2 and H19 postulates enhancer com-petition between these genes. According to this model, a shared enhancer downstream of H19 drives H19 RNA expression from the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, however, methylation of the H19 promoter allows the enhancer to interact instead with the adjacent IGF2 gene. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, maternally inherited rearrangements causing methylation of H19 promoter like paternal allele leads to over expression of IGF2 gene which gives patient higher risk of tumors in IGF2 expressing tissues (such as Wilm’s tumor)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methylating agent. <span>It hypomethylates DNA by<span> inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It can inhibit hypermethylation of CpG islands and avoid loss of tumor suppressing genes due to hypermethylation.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period means the period when epigenetics marks are being established, including the primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation early development. </p>
<p><span>DNA methylation agent (DNMT inhibitors) irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are  incorporated into DNA so is replication dependent. Lack of specificity might lead to long term effect on the normal cells.</span></p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods may cause much higher risk of non-specific toxic effects on rapidly replicated normal cells and lead to unwanted side effects.</p></div>
