    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation contributes to the regulation of gene expression and genome estability. This modification is focalized in the C-G rich regions, like CpG islands localized in the promotor or in introns or in repetitive elements. Normally, the CpG islands, which are in promotor region, are not methylated and if it were, the gene expression will be repressed. On the other hand, in cancer, this pattern is impaired, so the CpG islands methylated and repressed the normal expression of genes, like specific genes for a tissue. This disruptes the normal functioning of that tissue and contributes to the formation and progression of cancer. Another factor that contributes to cancer, is the hypomethylation of the intergenic and repetitive elements, regions which are normally methylated. This change in the methylation, going to hypomethylation of this regions contributes to the genome instability because permits the expression and the activation of this elements which are capable to "jump" to other regions in the genome, disrupting others important sequences like genes or regulators causing problems in the normal expression of that regions or target regions of the regulators.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the expression of the Igf2 is been for the paternal allele. There is a thought that says the father is the one who wants his baby growth a lot during the gestation, so the paternal Igf2 is not methylated which permits it's expression. On the other hand, like the mother is who carry on the baby and her body doesn't resist too much weight, her program codified by the imprinted Igf2 in the baby can control the baby's growth, because the maternal allele of Igf2 is methylated and it doesn't express. I think this is a pretty good form to remember how is the methylation pattern of the maternal and paternal alleles respect to this locus.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the most common abnormality is the activation of the normally silent maternal Igf2, promoting the tumor growth. And the maternal allele for H19, normally expressed, is silence. So, the maternal allele is the most affected on it's imprinting pattern. This cluster promotes, specially the tissue growth and in Wilm's tumor this cluster is out of control, because the change on it's methylation pattern promoting the formation and progression of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For many years, it has been a development for drugs to attack cancer. Decitabine is one of drugs which is classified like a DNA-demethylating agent. This clasification is due to the action of this drug over the methylation pattern. Decitabine promotes the hypomethylation, by inhibiting  the DNA methyltranferases. This have an anti-tumour effect, because this massive hypomethylation in the genome, causes genome instability and the overexpression of many genes, the gene expression is totally out of control generating a disaster specially in tumour cells, making them more susceptible to chemotherapy and driven them to death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetics marks which can inherite from one cell to another and from one individual to another y that it's possible because the DNA replication is semiconservative, so a half of the DNA has the information of the methylation and can recruit the methylation machinery like DNMT1, to maintain the DNA methylation. Tha hemi-methylated DNA, after it's replication, is sufficient to mantain and transmit this epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>In addition, there is two sensitive periods where, the whole genome suffer the epigenetic reprograming and is in this periods where the epigenetics marks are most susceptible to erase or suffer a wrong establishment, which can be an opportunity for environmental influences. This sensitive periods corresponds to gametogenesis and embryogenesis. So it'll be inadvisable to give the drugs to a pregnant woman for example, because the new individual can suffer serious consecuences because the DNA methylation patterns could affect the normal patterns of gene expression or cause the genome instability. This maybe can generate an increased risk for diseases later in life of this individual. Eventually it could affect the individual descendants if this affects his or her gametogenesis during his or her development.</p></div>
