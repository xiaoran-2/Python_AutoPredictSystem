    <h1>Submission 1033 from Anon (session_user_id: 1245580c6af2475073514aefb556b9fed546ae04)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). It is an FDA approved nucleoside analogue used for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML. Decitabine, being a nucleoside analogue, is incorporated into the DNA and upon DNA replication DNMTs irreversibly bind to it. The result is DNA demethylation, since DNMTs - and more specifically DNMT1 - are the enzymes responsible for passing the DNA methylation patterns to the daughter cells. As the function of Decitabine is replication dependent, cancer cells are first implicated, due to their higher replication rate compared to normal cells. It is known that cancer cells exhibit locus specific CpG island hypermethylation and in many cancer types, for example hematological malignancies like AML, tumor suppressor hypermethylation and thus silencing is observed. So, in tumors driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, depletion of DNA methylation (which can be caused by Decitabine) can suppress tumorigenesis, which explains why Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, since DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is mitotically heritable and  is maintained and passed down to daughter cells by DNMT1. DNMT1 recognises hemimethylated DNA, which is the result of DNA replication, and adds a methyl group to the unmethylated cytosine on the daughter DNA strand, according to the methylation on the parent strand. So, DNA methylation drugs can have enduring effects and should be avoided during sensitive periods. Sensitive periods are periods when altered environment can have an effect on epigenetic control. Two major sensitve periods are the primordial germ cell development period till the production of mature gametes and the preimplantation and early postimplantation period, during which epigenetic marks are actively remodelled. Thus, treating younger patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive period of gametogenesis (when the germ cell maturation still takes place) should be avoided. Since those drugs are not specific for  tumor cells, they could lead to epigenetic disruptions in the germ cells, which could be passed to the offspring, resulting in abnormal epigenetic control and even lead to disease. Furthermore, they could have long term effects on normal cells' function and affect the patient's future health.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  The H19/Igf2 cluster is located on chromosome 11 and Igf2 gene is an imprinted oncogene (normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome). In the paternal allele the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, blocking the binding of the insulator protein CTCF. So, the enhancers downstream are able to activate the Igf2 expression. Furthermore, the promoter of H19, from which the lncRNA H19 is expressed, is also methylated (due to DNA methylation spreading) and the H19 expression is silenced. In contrast, on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF insulator can bind to it, insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. So, the enhancers act on H19, which is only maternally expressed. Disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus can contribute to cancer and in fact, loss of imprinting is a common feature in cancer. Wilm's tumour (often symptom of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, caused by paternal uniparental disomy, mutation or epigenetic disruption, like hypermethylation of the maternal ICR) is associated with overexpression of the growth promoting oncogene Igf2 (it becomes expressed from both alleles). Due to disrupted imprinting, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal (no binding of CTCF, H19 methylation and silencing, double dose of the growth promoting Igf2).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>  CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides (in the cytosine of which methylation takes place), that are often found at gene promoters and tend to be protected from methylation (except for a small subset of them). However, if DNA methylation takes place, it causes gene silencing through chromatin condensation (recruitment of MECP proteins) and prohibiting transcription factor binding. In cancer, however, locus specific CpG island hypermethylation is observed, leading to tumour suppressor gene silencing (like a genetic mutation does). The hypermethylation and inactivation of these genes leads to cancer progression and is one of the Knudson hypothesis hits. In fact, different CpG islands (and sets of them) are hypermethylated in different cancer types and can be used as single biomarkers or panels of biomarkers (for diagnosis, prognosis and potential treatment). Furthermore, CpG island shores (2 kb neighbouring CpG islands) are hypermethylated in cancer and have a better predicting value of gene expression. In addition, loss of imprinting, a hallmark of cancer, can be caused by hypo- or hypermethylation of ICRs. As for intergenc regions and repetitine elements, they normally tend to be methylated, and this methylation maintains genomic integrity. This happens in the case of intergenic elements by silencing cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites and in the case of repeats by preventing transposition (through silencing of repeats and mutagenising them via the conversion of methylC to T - "genome defense model"), avoiding illegitimate recombination and preventing transcriptional interference from strong promoters. In cancer, a general genome-wide DNA hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions is found, leading to genomic instability and an abnormal karyotype, a common feature of cancer, as revealed also by experimental data. This is due to transposition, illegitimate recombination of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters, leading to disruption of nearby genes. Also, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is found in cancer, causing activation of associated genes, including growth promoting oncogenes.</p></div>
