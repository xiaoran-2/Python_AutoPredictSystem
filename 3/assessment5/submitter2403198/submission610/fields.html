    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>All in all, DNA methylation decrease as normal cells transforms into cancer cells,however CpG island methylation increase.</p>
<p>CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells but there is hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores in cancer cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands is observed of tumour suppressor genes and it means that these genes become silent. It allows cancer to originate because these genes exclude<span> uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</span></p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are metylated in normal cells but there is hypomethylation of these elements in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic elements resulted in genomic instability because many  processes that are harmful for genomic stability can occur, for example,iIllegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. It occurs because repetitive elements when they are hypomethylated become active (they are no more silent) and some of them whien they become active can migrate within genome (in copy/paste or cut/paste manner). Genomic instability can cause diseases, also cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR of paternal allele is methylated and this methylation blocks CTCF binding to ICR. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates lgf2 from downstream enhancers. As CTCF cannot bind to ICR, enhancers can access lgf2 and activate it but as DNA metylation from ICR spreads to H19 promoter, H19 is silent. </p>
<p>ICR of maternal allele is not methylated and this allows CTCF to bind to ICR. In this case, downstream enhancers cannot access and activate lgf2 but they activate H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there are hypermetylation of ICR because ICR of maternal allele is also metylated. It means that both alleles behave like paternal allele. So, both alleles express lgf2 but do not express H19. It leads to overexpression of lgf2 which contributes to cancer because upregulated lgf2 is associated with growth promoting and as oncogene. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine demethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferese. It is cytidine analog. <span>Decitabine can be incorporate into DNA during replication. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA inhibits methyltransferase, causing demethylation in that sequence.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In cancer cells, CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated and that means that these genes become silent. This resulted in uncontrolled cell division. Decitabine has an anti-tumour effect because by demethylating DNA of tumour suppressor genes, normal function of these genes is restored and it means that control over cell growth is also restored.</span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine has two anti-tumour effects because decitabine also belongs to antimetabolites. Antimetabolite interaction with a number of targets within the cell produces a direct cytotoxic effect that resulted in death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect because epigenetic state is mitotic heritable and it ensures that the same genes are expressed in daughter cells and it also ensures tisssue homogeneity.</p>
<p><span>Sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. During s</span>ensitive periods altered environments can have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are during embryogenesis and gametogenesis when epigenetic marks are cleared and resetted. Childhood can also be considered as a period of vulnerability because germ cells are still developing.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because these drugs can alter epigenetic state in a wrong way in blastocyst or germ cells during clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. If there were errors in epigenetic state of blastocyst or germ cells, it would have a potential to affect a big part of cells of the the young organism or affect viability of embryo because germ cell makes zygota and blastocyst divides and gives all cells and organs. These epigenetic errors would remain in daughter cells because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable.</p></div>
