    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the CpG islands are hypomethylated. This is usually independent of their activity state. On the contrary, in cancer, promoter CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated, which causes transcriptional silencing of the underlying gene expression. This silencing can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. DNA methylation at the CpG islands that are associated with tumour suppression leads to the silencing on tumour suppressor genes. DNA methylation at the CpG islands can be one of the hits in the Knudson’s hypothesis which suggests that cancer is the result of multiple hits to the DNA. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands, although reversible, causes the same job as mutations. Additionally, there is aberrant DNA methylation in cancer at CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands. In normal cells, there is DNA hypermethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive element. However, in cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (genome-wide loss of DNA methylation). This genome wide hypomethylation causes genomic instability which results into illegitimate recombinations between repeats-because they are not densely packaged, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.  Additionally, Hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters can result into activation of the associated genes causing cancer. Examples are the R-RAS activation in gastric cancer and miR21 activation in glioma.<em> </em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. Since the ICR is methylated, CTCF does not bind to it. Enhancers therefore act on Igf2 and the Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele.   On the other hand, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated in the normal cells and hence CTCF binds to the ICR and insulates it. Enhancers then act on H19 resulting into silencing of the Igf2 on the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, there is hypemethylation of the ICR resulting into loss of the imprinting.  In this condition, there is hypermethylation of the ICR on maternal allele resulting into expression of Igf2 on this allele. With the paternal allele also expressing Igf2, this results into double dose of Igf2 resulting into overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and hence the Wilm’s tumour.<em> </em></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  During cell division, DNMT is involved in copying methylation to the DNA daughter strand.  The drug, after it has been incorporated in the DNA, irreversibly binds to DNMT, methylation is not copied to the daughter strand and hence the daughter DNA becomes hypomethylated. In cancer, there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands which is usually associated with the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Hypomethylation of the CpG island by the action of Decitabine therefore results into activation of the tumour suppressor genes which are then involved in silencing oncogenes and hence inhibiting the replication of tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and hence it is mitotically heritable. The Methylation is laid down by DNMT which ensure the the methylation pattern on the parent DNA strand copied to the daughter strand. A sensitive period refers to a period of development when the environment may influence the epigenetic make-up.   The sensitive periods occur during embryogenesis (pre-implantation period and early post implantation period) and gametogenesis (primordial germ cell development to formation of gametes). During these periods there is active remodelling of the epigenome by removal and laying down of epigenetic marks. Use of epigentic drugs during the sensitive periods might affect epigenetic marks which are involved in controling the chromosome structure and in gene expression. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods should therefore be avoided since the drugs can make modifications on the epigenetic machinery and the effect will be passed on to daughter cells and/or the next generation.  </p></div>
