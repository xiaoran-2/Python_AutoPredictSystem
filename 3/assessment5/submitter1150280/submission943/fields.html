    <h1>Submission 943 from Anon (session_user_id: aec008ec81f313fc46d72d0a8960dfdbfcbc0471)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug for the treatment of for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, <span>which are diseases of the bone marrow,</span> and for acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine is a member of a class of drugs that affect demethylation processes.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. By the process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is a process which alters the expression of genes in cells by the addition of a methyl group to the DNA nucleotides. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, making the altered DNA methilation have enduring effect on the epigenome. </span></p>
<p><span>DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Thus, proper DNA methylation is essential for cell differentiation and embryonic development, making the embryo very sensitive to any alterations in DNA methylation.</span></p>
<p><span>Thus, treating patients during pregnancy, when embryo cells are sensitive to epigenetic changes, would be inadvisable.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription and<span> one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic events taking place in the mammalian genome. <span>DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification, resulting in the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring. <span>The addition of a methyl group occurs generally in cytosine within CpG dinucleotides which are concentrated in large clusters called CpG islands. </span></span></span></span>It is commonly known that inactivation of certain tumor-suppressor genes occurs as a consequence of hypermethylation within the promoter regions and a numerous studies have demonstrated a broad range of genes silenced by DNA methylation in different cancer types.</p>
<p>On the other hand, global hypomethylation, which is commonly met in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, also contributes to cell transformation. Repetitive elements represent a large portion of the human genome (~45%) and contain much of the CpG methylation found in normal human somatic tissues. Loss of DNA methylation in these sequences might induce overall gemone instability and plays a role in a large percentage of human cancers that have been studied. <span>Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF2) and H19 genes are imprinted in mouse and human, with expression of the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 alleles. Two regulatory regions are important for their parental allele-spedfic expression: a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of H19 and a set of tissue-specific enhancers downstream of H19. The enhancers specifically activate Igf2 on the paternal chromosome and H19 on the maternal chromosome. The interactions between the enhancers and the genes are regulated by the DMR, which works as a selector by exerting dual functions: a methylated DMR on the paternal chromosome inactivates adjacent H19 and an unmethylated DMR on the maternal chromosome insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. <span>Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene <span>is the most common genetic or epigenetic alteration in Wilms tumor.</span></span><br /></span></p></div>
