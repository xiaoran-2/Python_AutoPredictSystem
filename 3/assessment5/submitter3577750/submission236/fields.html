    <div class="field-value"><address>CpG islands frequently are found at the promoters of genes, and their methylation is associated with gene silencing (like in the X chromosome). Usually CpG islands are protected from methylation, but in cancer cells we can find increased methylation of CpG islands in the tumour suppressor genes, which leads to the silencing and lack of tumour suppressive function. examples of such regions are RB involved in retinoblastoma, or MLH1 involved in colorectal cancer. Unlike CpG island, intergenic regions and repetitive regions are usually methylated. The function of methylating intergenic regions is that it prevents genomic instability by silencing cryptic promoters and splice sites in the transcription process. On the other hand methylation of repetitive regions has the role of maintaining genomic integrity by preventing transposition of repetitive elements and prevent incorrect recombination of chromosomes. In cancer this two regions are hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability: illegitimate recombination of chromosomes, activation of cryptic promoters which leads to inactivation of neighboring genes.</address></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally on the patternal allele The ICR regon is methylated as well as the promoter of the H19 gene. as a result CTCF protein doesn't bind to this region, the insulation doesn't occur, so the enhancers that are downstream to ICR can enhance the activation of Igf2 gene, which is the transcribed (expressed from the patternal allele). On the matternal allele ICR region is not methylated so CTCF protein can bind to it, insulating the the Igf2 gene from the influence of the enhancers, which in turn enhance the activation of H19 which is transcribed(expressed from maternal allele). whie Igf2 is inactivated. In Wilm's tumour ICR region is methylated both on patternal and maternal allele, and they both acr as paternal allele, If2 being overexpressed(being a growth promoter gene), while H19 is silenced(a growth restrictin gene), causing unlimited growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds to DNMT enzymes, enzymes which have the funcion of methylating DNA. As methylation occurs mostly in dividing cells, the lack of methylation in daughter cells of each new generation of cells acts as demethylation. Although its mechanism of action is not clear, it probably dependends on type of tumours, more exactly on tumours where the main epigenetic aberration is hypermethylation of CpG islands or ICRs within tumour suppressing genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects in the epigenome, because DNA methylation is mitotically and meiotically inherited, and it is very important during sensitive periods when there is a massive demethylation (clearing of paternal and maternal epigenetic marks) with their further resetting of this marks by the methylation (reprogramming). There are 2 such periops: early embrionoc life (from zygote to gastrulation) and primordial germ cell development (from mid gestation embryo to formation of gametes). treating patients during this periods(pregnant women, young fertile adults) may lead to failure to inactivate genes that should be inactive in certain tissues or certain time of embrionic development, and loss of parental imprinting (with both maternal and paternal alleles being expressed). Second, during adult life, methylation of DNA is maintained thoughout the life of the adult, by DNMT1 which methylates hemimethited DNA in daughter cells. Altering DNA methylation may lead to increasing over time of population of cells with loss of epigenetic marks, so the treating of children with epigenetic drugs is problematic.</p></div>
