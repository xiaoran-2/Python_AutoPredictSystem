    <div class="field-value">In normal cells the CpG islands are not methylated so the gene followed this CPGI expressed. DNA methylation in CpG island lead to silence the gene followed by those CpG islands since many of these are promoters.
In cancer cells, There is hyper methylation of CpG island  of tumour suppressor gene and it leads to inactivation of those genes lead to tumour growth.
Hyper methylation in CpG islands leads to silence the tumour suppressor genes that leads to uncontrollable growth of tumours due to lack of control over the growth. These hyper methylation are heritable and have same effect as mutation in the tumour suppressor gene. These hypermethylation in CpG islands are differed in different cell types , so it used as the bio marker for diagnostic purpose.Hyper methylation in CpG  islands is not for all but only for certain genes. It's used to identify the type of cancer and its subtypes since these hyper methylation are depends on the type of cancer.
In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated heavily so that those region not accessible to the enzyme and remains inactive. The methylation in these region provide Genetic stability.
In cancer cells, there is genome wide hypo methylation including intergenic region and repetitive elements that's leads to genetic instability due to Illegitimate recombination between repeats,  Activation of repeats and transposition and Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.  This increase the tumerogenisis.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your answer include the following points:   In Normal cells, the maternal allele the  H19 is expressed since the Imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and it bind with CTCF protein which allows the enhancer transcribes the H19. It leads to silent the Igf2 gene.

In normal cells, the parental allele the ICR is methylated which prohibit the binding of CTCF protein to ICR. So the enhancer bind to Igf2 and activate that. 

In Wilm tumour patients, both parental and maternal allele the ICR  is methylated so which lead to activation of Igf2 in both allele which  is become double strength compare to the normal . It's increase the growth of the cell since Igf2 is  codes for growth hormone.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent sold as  Dacogen by Eisai (Japanese company). Its mechanism is similar to  azacitidine   and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypo methylated the DNA by inhibiting DNA methyl transferase  and it only can bindi to DNA not to RNA. 
Decitabine-induced hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are essential  for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Stephen Baylin showed that combination therapy of histone deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine ( Demethylating agent) potential epigentic drug against lung cancer. It is the first epigentic drug used against solid tumour which hard to treat since the drug need penetrate to access it. These demethylating of DNA makes the tumour cells more susceptible to the chemical drugs used in chemotherapy.</p>
<p>the sensitive periods are the periods herein epigentic reprogramming occurred. Eg: early development ( blastocyst) and PGC development (primordial germ cells gametes)</p>
<p>all the epigentic drugs are changing the epigentic markers like demethylating agents, so during the regrprogramming periods naturally the epigentic markers are removed. So if we treat during this period, these epigentic markers are ineffective since already epigenetic markers are removed during period. Even  if we treat the patients during this sensitive period, once  this reprogramming is over then again the methylation resumed. So chemotherapy drug can't work on the target because all the methylation is still present. </p></div>
