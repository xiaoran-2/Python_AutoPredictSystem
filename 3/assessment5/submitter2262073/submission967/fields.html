    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CpG clusters at DNA promotor sites) are usually protected from DNA methylation (attachment of a methly group to the 5' C) but in rare instances this does occur and  is associated with gene silencing. Proteins MeCP1 and MeCP2 which have both a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional repressive domain will bind to the methylated cytosine and will either silence the gene by themselves or will recruit other proteins to further condense the chromatin. </p>
<p>In cancerous cells the methylation occurs at the site of a tumor suppressive gene: this is one hit of many that is required according to the Knudsen Hypothesis for tumor growth.  Inactivation of the tumor suppressive gene in addition to another epigenetic change such as activation of an oncogene will allow that cell to grow and have a selective advantage over other normal cells, causing formation of a tumor.</p>
<p>Inergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated.  The silenced repetitive elements prevents transitional interference from strong promotors, transposition and illegitimate recombination.  The methylation of intergenic regions prevents deletions, insertions, duplications of whole chromosomes and reciprocal translocations. Cryptic promotors and cryptic splice sites are also silenced.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells this methylation is removed. Promoters that were silenced are now active and and can cause undesireable genes to be expressed, or can cause interruption of transcription of necessary genes. Intergenic regions that were silenced can now become active causing insertions, deletions, recprocal translocation, duplication of whole chromosomes. The stability of the cell is disrupted and the cell grows out of control causing disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent; these agents work by targeting enzymes that add methyl groups to the DNA. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which becomes incorporated into the DNA during replication. When DNMT attaches to the Decitabine nucleoside it is bound irreversibly and the enzyme is thus nullified causing less DNA methylation. DNA methylation prevents expression of certain genes such a tumor suppressors, so removal of DNMT would allow for more expression of these suppressor genes.  Because this action is division-dependent and because cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells cancer cells would be targeted more than normal cells and the tumor could be reduced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele the Igf2 ICR cluster is methylated and the CTCF is unable to bind to the site.  The DNA methylation spreads downstream to the CpG promoter of H19 and the gene is silenced.  This allows the downstream enhancers to act on the ICR and Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR cluster is not methylated and this allows  CTCF to bind to the site. CTCF is an insulator protein and insulates the promotor from the downstream enhancers.  In an action known as chromotin looping, the enhancers instead of acting on the preferred site - the Igf2 cluster - act instead on the H19 promoter site and Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In normal cells the maternal Igf2 cluster is silenced and only the paternal allele produces growth-promoting factor, while the maternal allele expresses H19, a growth-inhibiting factor.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal Ifg2 ICR is also methylated and Igf2 is expressed in both maternal and paternal alleles.  The H19 is also silenced in both alleles so the child with this disease receives a double dose of the oncogene with no H19 to mitigate this.  This causes a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a permanent change to the cell's chromosome structure and is passed on to daughter cells until the period when all epigenetic marks are erased.   .</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are those during which all epigenetic marks are erased and new ones set in place.  This happens during the blastocyst stage and during peimordial cell development. </p>
<p>Treating a pregnant woman during those stages could have a detrimental effect on the developing child causing epigentics to be placed where they shouldn't be.</p></div>
