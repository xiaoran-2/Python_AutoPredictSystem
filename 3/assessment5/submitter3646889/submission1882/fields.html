    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The CpG islands are usually present at the promoters of gene ie the position where transcription of the gene starts. Generally most of the CpG islands are unmethylated with some exceptions like X inactivation. Methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the gene. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, thereby silencing the expression of the genes. In a cancer tissue, the CpG islands of a set of genes are frequently hypermethylated also called CpG island methylator phenotype.   </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes, growth suppressors , DNA repair genes, cell cycle regulator genes etc. which leads to genomic instability, continuous and proliferative division of cell, no cell death, metastasis etc. Basically all oncogenes are expressed and all tumor/growth suppressors are silenced leading to dysregulated gene expression and carcinogenesis . This will inturn lead to aberrant DNA, translocations and point mutations in the epigenetic machinery itself.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and thus remain silenced. Repeats as the name suggests are patterns present in multiple copies. So silencing them helps in overexpression of gene. This helps in maintaining genomic stability, prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination. Intergenic regions also contain lncRNAs that are needed for pluripotency and differentiation. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (ie methylation is removed). There is lack of DNMT1 which brings about hypomethylation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Due to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats, they may not remain silent and start to express. There is overexpression/amplification of many gene expression. Also leads to genomic instability, illegitimate recombinations, loss of imprinting, reactivation of transposable elements etc. The hypomethylation may also lead to expression of genes which promotes(oncogene) or suppresses(tumor suppressors) other genes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In paternal allele, the Imprint Control region(ICR) is methylated (methylation also spreads downstream to H19 gene). So the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the ICR. So the promoters present downstream H19 gene can act on Igf2 gene and thus lead to its expression. So, Igf2 is expressed in Paternal allele.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and H19 also is not methylated. So, CTCF insulator protein binds to the ICR, thereby blocking the promoters from acting on Igf2. These promoters in turn act on H19 and H19 is expressed, but Igf2 is not expressed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR in the maternal allele gets hypermethylated. So the H19 gene expression is silenced and the CTCF binding also does not take place at ICR as a result promoters act on Igf2 and  Igf2 is expressed. Paternal allele is normal and Igf2 is expressed form it. So, now both maternal and paternal allele express Igf2, leading to overexpression(double dose) of Igf2.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Igf2 gene is growth promoter. Overexpression of Igf2 leads to Wilm’s Tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is DNA Demethylating agent. It is a drug that targets epigenetic machinery specifically DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>An optimum amount of Decitabine administered can inhibit the DNA Methyltransferase(DNMT), so disabling it from methylating the gene. The methylation is reduced in the genes(demethylation / hypomethylation).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine acts just before the replication of DNA or cell division. It binds DNMT irreversibly to DNA thereby inhibiting DNMT. As decitabine acts when cells divides, the cells that divide more are affected the most ie cancer cells are affected most.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Epigenetic drugs when administered acts on cancer cells as well as normal cells and changes the epigenome. For ex if we are using DNMTi drugs then it results in demethylation in all cells. The changes that these drugs introduce are mitotically inherited as epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter cells. So, these changes may be maintained for the whole life of a person.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sensitive period may be defined as the period in which administration of epigenetic drugs may have adverse effects. Especially when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place, use of epigenetic drugs will have adverse effects. In early life, we are sensitive to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sensitive periods are ‘primordial germ cell to mature germ cell development stage’ and ‘early pre implantation to post implantation stage’. This is the time when epigenetic reprogramming takes place and epigenetic drugs can interfere or inhibit epigenetic reprogramming itself. Young patients especially when germ cells are being formed are the sensitive to epigenetic drugs.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation is involved in gene regulation, normal development etc. Changes in DNA methylation could also lead to different diseases. Some studies even direct early life disruption in epigenome to mental illness.</span></p></div>
