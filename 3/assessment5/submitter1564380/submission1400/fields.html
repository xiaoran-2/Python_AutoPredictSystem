    <h1>Submission 1400 from Anon (session_user_id: adcf4b2dad3242d0f92b418f909e1e94518983ce)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug which belongs to DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors). DNMTi gets incorporated to the DNA upon replication, binding a nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daugther strand. This process is irreversible and cell division dependent. Because in cancer there is a high rate of cell division, this drug acts effectively in a specific dose, because an overdose of Decitabine is nonspecific and toxic for the body.  DNA demethylation is caused by the impact of Decitabine, which has shown good effects in the treatment of <span>myelodysplastic syndrome because this is dependent of CpG islands hypermethylation.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>The process of DNA methylation is primordial to determine differentiation, development and cellular homoestasis, is the the basis of imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the heterochromatin formation. Since DNA methylation of promoter regions generally correlates with gene expression, altering this process would have terrible effects on the epigenome, some of them could be diseases such as the Lynch syndrome, in which DNA hypermethylation of one allele in all tissues is examined. The methylation of certain areas in the epigenome can cause either the expression or silencing of a particular gene. Hypermethylated CpG islands are responsible of multiple types of cancer. </p>
<p>There are periods of development, or "sensitive periods", when altered environments have an effect on the epigenetic control, these periods are during the pre and post implantantion, and in the primordial germ cell to production of mature egg and sperm. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the occurance of an active reprogramming of the epigenome. Because of the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes, this could  have an impact in the phenotypes or gene expression patterns in their offspring, and in women, in their grandsons. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA replication is dependent in epigenetic mechanisms, one of them it DNA methylation. CpG islands are usually kept free from methylation, but in cancer these cells promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated resulting in a silencing of the gene in cis. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands works in a reciprocal corss, therefore intergenic regions and repetitive elements kept hypomethylated resulting in a silencing of the tumour supressor genes, these cells are more likely to replicate and block apoptosis, resulting in cancer. </p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, considering that the main purpose of the DNA methylation is to mantain genomic stability (prevent loss, gain of illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes), repress transcriptional noise, inhibit antisense transcription or RNA direct splicing (relation to replication timing), hypomethylation of repeats could lead in an important genomic instability resulting in illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes, resulting in an abnormal karyotype containing deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. In cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not densely packaged down in heterochromatin, therefore they align, misalign, and then illegitimate recombinations may occur. Also, repetitive elements are able to replicate themselves and transpose around the genome disrupting coding regions or activating neighbouring genes, they are strong promoters. An example of this is the activation of the agouti gene or axin genes, other transcriptional aberrations may contribute to disease, like ICF (<span>immunodeficiency and cranio-facial defect</span>) syndrome in human diseases, where the main cause are mutations in DNMT3B causing genomic instability in the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation located at the ICR (Imprint control region) of the paternal allele (paternally imprinted) results in an unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele, it becames bound by the CTCF protein (insulator), insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers located at the maternal allele. H19, a long noncoding RNA produced in the maternal allele can then be expressed because of the enhancers and chromating looping. Because of the block of Igf2 by the CTCF proteing, the enhancers then loop into H19 to enhance its expression. </p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the methylation at the ICR inhibits the binging of CTCF, causing the enhancers binding freely at Igf2 and promoting its expression in the paternal allele only. H19 is not expressed at this allele because of the DNA methylation at ICRs which spreads downstream into the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation at ICRs causes a loss of imprinting, because the hypermethylation at both alleles causes a double dose of Igf2 expression. Because Igf2 promotes growth, is directly assosiated with Wilm's tumour. Hypomethylation or hypermethylation are early events in tumoregenesis, they act on different proteins inhibiting or promoting the expression of certain genes, causing a lack or an extra dose of certain genes.</p></div>
