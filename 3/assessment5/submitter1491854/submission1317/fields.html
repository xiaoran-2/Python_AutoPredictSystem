    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, CpG islands and CpG shores are hypomethylated, but intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. On the contrary, in the cancer cell, CpG islands and CpG shores are hypermethylated, but intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Usually, CpG islands are associated with promoter regions and their level of methylation negatively correlates with the expression level of the downstream genes, i.e. the higher methylated CpG islands the lower expression of the downstream genes. Therefore, the genes with upstream CpG islands are repressed in cancer. These genes include tumor suppressors, so the mechanisms that can prevent growth of cancer cell are switched off. Repetitive elements include various mobile elements. Their hypomethylation activates their expression followed by increase in the rate of random genome insertion. Hypomethylated repetitive elements also provide sites for recombination. Therefore, hypomethylation of repetitive elements increases genomic instability by increasing the rate of mobile elements insertion and recombination events. Intergenic regions includes ICRs (Imprinting Control Regions). Abberant methylation of ICRs interferes with genomic imprinting and can result either in increased expression of protooncogenic genes that help to progress the cancer or in decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes. In addition, abberant methylation of intergenic regions may affect expression of non-coding RNAs, which in turn leads to abnormal regulation of their target genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to class of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases . Chemically, decitabine is a cytidine analog. Inside the cell, decitabine is phosphorylated to 5AZA-dCTP, analog of dCTP, and is incorporated into DNA during DNA synthesis. Upon interaction with 5AZA, methyltransferases becomes covalently attached to DNA, and this leads to their inactivation. Thus, via DNMTs inactivation decitabine decreases level of DNA methylation in CpG islands and CpG shores, thereby it activates a subset repressed genes. Among these reactivated genes may be those encoding for tumor suppressors that can stop the cancer cell cycle or induce cell death by apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation caused by epigenetic drugs is mitotically inheritable. Moreover, epigenetic modifications in DNA may affect modifications of histones. The total epigenetic state of the given region can be maintained by the epigenetic modifiers (DNMTs, histone methyltransferases and so on) after DNA replication. So, the epigenetic state of the given region once modified by the drug can be inherited by daughter cancer cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a time period when genome-wide clearing and reestablishing of epigenetic marks (epigenetic reprogramming) is taking place. There are two sensitive periods of development: primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation period of early development. During these periods epigenetic drugs may have genome-wide effect on methylation profile. The changes in genome methylation then mitotocally inherited to all cells of the developing organisms. If ICR regions are affected, these changes may include abberant impringing that can be passed through the several following generations. These epigenetic changes may promote cancer development. Therefore, treating patients during sensitive periods may have negative effect on their future generations, and, thus, is inadvisable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster includes in the following order: Igf2 gene; ICR that overlaps with insulator that blocks Igf2 gene expression and serves as CTCF binding site; H19 gene encoding for CTCF; and Igf2 enhancers. In normal cell, on the maternal allele ICR is not methylated, thus enabling CTCF to bind to its insulator and block Igf2 expression. On the paternal allele ICR is methylated blocking CTCF binding. In the absense of CTCF, methylation spreads to the promoter of H19 and causes repression of H19 expression. Therefore, insulator is not working, and Igf2 is expressed. In Wilm's tumor maternal allele of ICR is also methylated that causes total repression of CTCF expression. In the absense of CTCF maternal ellele of Igf2 is expressed. So, cancer cells have overexpression of Igf2, which is oncogene that promotes cancer cell growth.</p></div>
