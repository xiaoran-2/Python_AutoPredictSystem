    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands in the promoter region of genes are typically protected from methylation, despite the presence of more CpG’s than would be expected by chance. However, methylation of a CpG island results in gene silencing. This CpG methylation happens for a small number of genes that are silenced and depends on cell type, particular times or developmental stages.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, an increasing number of CpG islands are methylated as the disease progresses. This hypermethylation results in the silencing of the respective gene, including tumour suppressor genes. Understanding which CpG Islands (and consequent tumour suppressor genes) have been hypermethylated can allow for the diagnosis of tumour type.</p>
<p>An example of CpG island DNA hypermethylation is Lynch Syndrome - a hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Although typically the syndrome is due to a mutation in the mismatch repair gene, <em>MLH1</em>, there is an instance in which the CpG island of the gene is hypermethylated in one allele of every tissue.  </p>
<p>Methylation at intergenic and repetitive elements is typically high, allowing a normal cell to maintain genomic integrity by ensuring the proper number of chromosomes and normal recombination events during replication.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of these sites can cause long repeats to move from heterochromatin to the more easily accessible euchromatin, allowing improper recombination between chromosomes due to the high sequence similarity of the now easily accessible repeats. Additionally, when hypomethylated, these repeats are able to make copies of themselves and transpose across the genome, possibly disrupting the coding region of a gene or activate a neighbouring gene.</p>
<p>Aberrant methylation resulting in genomic instability is a characteristic of not only cancer but also in Immunodeficiency and Cranio-Facial Defect Syndrome, in which there is a mutation in DNMT3B (a de novo methyltransferase) causing DNA hypermethylation at repeats found around the centromere.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Within the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at the imprinting control region (ICR), blocking the insulator protein – CTCF – from binding, which allows downstream enhancers to activate the <em>Igf2</em> gene.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to the ICR, blocking the enhancers from acting on the maternal <em>Ifg2</em> but causing them to instead act on the maternal <em>H19</em> long non-coding RNA. The paternal <em>H19 </em>lncRNA is not expressed due to methylation spreading from the ICR to the <em>H19</em> promoter. Therefore, there is one copy each of paternal <em>Igf2 </em>and maternal <em>H19</em>.</p>
<p> In Wilm’s tumour, however, both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated allowing for a “double-dose” of <em>Igf2 </em>from both parental alleles and no transcription of <em>H19</em>. As <em>Igf2 </em>is growth promoting, it is associated with Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>In a non-cancerous disease, Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, there are various imprinting abnormalities in linked <em>Kcnq1</em> and <em>H19/Igf2</em> clusters. The two clusters work in concert – <em>Cdkn1c</em> is a tumour suppressor and <em>Igf2</em> a growth promoter. In the Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome, two paternal alleles are inherited causing a loss of <em>Cdkn1c </em>and a doubling of <em>Igf2</em>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor used for treating myeloidysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into DNA upon replication. DNMT1 binds to the nucleoside to copy its methylation status to the daughter strand but is bound irreversibly, thus stopping its capacity to further methylate the genome. It therefore serves as a hypomethylator and reduces the silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>As cancer cells typically divide much more quickly than normal cells, Decitabine will be most effective on them as it requires replicating cells to work.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A change in DNA methylation at ICRs can affect expression of growth related genes, either by decreasing growth restricting ones or increasing growth promoting genes. However, this process is typical during early development or during sensitive periods. For example, Wilm’s tumour is caused by incorrect methylation at the ICR and is a childhood kidney cancer – a preneoplastic tumour. In addition to altered states of ICRs, when using specific drugs like Decitabine from question 3, tumour suppressor genes that had been methylated can be unmethylated to reactivate expression. As DNMT1 is inhibited, further methylation transfer to daughter cells is affected and a more hypomethylated state is established.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained. Epigenetic reprogramming (and therefore sensitive periods) occurs during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. There is the potential for other critical periods - perhaps for more specific genes - such as Överkalix children, in which the critical stage estimated for growth and the impact on food supply in boys 9-12 and girls from 9-10 years.  </p>
<p>Therefore, treating patients during these sensitive stages could adversely affect genes that are susceptible to changes in epigenetic state for the rest of that individual’s life and their offspring.</p></div>
