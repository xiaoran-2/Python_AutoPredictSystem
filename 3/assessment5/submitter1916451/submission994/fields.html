    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Normally, in our entire genome, </span><span>methylation</span><span> is sparsely found, but globally distributed, at CpG dinucleotides. Generally, this methylation functions as gene silencing and is vital for genomic integrity at both intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Three more methylation functions can be added in the case of repetitive elements: silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters and lastly, preventing illegitimate recombination.</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, the human genome is punctuated by CpG rich regions called ‘CpG islands’.These islands (found in 50% of genes) are different as they are predominantly unmethylated (i.e. active), which seems to be the rule in healthy cells. Usually, these islands sit near the promotor region of genes involved in housekeeping, tissue specificity and developmental regulation.</p>
<p>Disruptions to this methylation landscape can arise via two processes - (1) a genome wide lack of methylation will bring hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements and/or (2) CpG island hypermethylation. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly this disruption can contribute to disease and cancer. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements will generate genome instability (a hallmark of tumor cells), which can be observed through the following recombination mechanisms: illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to neighboring genes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CpG island hypermethylation can lead to transcriptional silencing of suppressor genes, which is our body’s first line of defense in the general prevention of cancer (tumor suppressor hypermethylation), and promote oncogene activation, which frequently occurs in tumors.</p>
<p>These changes in DNA methylation patterns happen early in tumorigenesis, and they are mitotically heritable, so consequently, will continue to propagate from mother to daughter cells in tumors.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Genomic imprinting is a regulatory phenomenon in which the gene expression of each parental allele is regulated in a parent specific manner. </span>This regulation involves in particular two main players in a cluster of genes on chromosome 11 - Igf2 which is involved in the growth and development of the foetus and the gene H19, which is believed to act as a growth suppressor (i.e. turning Igf2 off).</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, due to methylation marks at the imprint control region (ICR), Igf2 gets to be expressed and H19 is turned off. Conversely, due to unmethylation at the same ICR, Igf2 on the maternal allele gets to be turned off and H19 is activated instead. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor (embryonic kidney cancer) there is a loss of maternal chromosome imprinting at the Igf2/H19 cluster and a switch instead to the methylation pattern of the paternal allele (paternal uniparental disomy). In effect H19 gets inactivated and Igf2 gets over-expressed leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and possible kidney tumors.</p>
<p>This lost of imprinting resulting in H19 inactivation (hypermethylation) and biallelic expression of Igf2, can lead to other types of cancer when an usually silent, growth promotor allele, is reactivated and uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation ensues.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors named DNMTi which stands for DNA methytransferase inhibitors.</span></p>
<p>DNMT belongs to a family of enzymes (DNMT1 and DNMT3) that facilitates the transfer of a methyl group to CpG dinucleotides, in particular the hemimethylated ones during mitosis - although DNMT3 can methylate both hemimethylated and unmethylated (de novo) CpG dinucleotides. Inhibiting this process makes Decitabine an hypomethylation agent and as such reactivates tumor suppressing genes silenced by DNA methylation causing growth arrest and apotosis in tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic dysregulation leading to aberrant DNA methylation is a common finding in cancer that can lead to silencing tumor suppression genes. Epigenetic drugs can reactivate these silenced genes; restoring the original epigenetic landscape and helping the effectiveness of standard chemotherapy. </span></p>
<p><span>This is possible because of epigenetic programming and cellular heritability which create a memory so that daughter cells maintain the same identity as their mother, as a kind of memory cell identity through several generations.</span></p>
<p><span>As with any drugs, epigenetic drugs have a systemic effect, they will not just affect the epigenetic landscape of cancerous cells but all cells equally. </span>This systemic effect is most problematic in children who go through what we call a sensitive period; which is a plastic time when DNA methylation markers are erased before new ones are established and changes in chromatin architecture are also seen.</p>
<p><span>Primordial germ line cells are most affected by this plasticity, which continues until puberty when the gametes have finally matured. </span>Treating patients with drugs that facilitate hypomethylation during sensitive periods would wreck havoc with the normal epigenetic landscape leading to health problems in the subsequent generations.</p>
