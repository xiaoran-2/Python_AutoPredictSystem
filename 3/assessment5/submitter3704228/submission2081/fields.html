    <h1>Submission 2081 from Anon (session_user_id: e02df7d7f16ec9876ce58775814a25bbd568c9d6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I think that the enduring effects of the DNA methylation in the epigenome are because these are mitotically heritable to paternal chains  and subsequently DNMT1 specifically recognizes hemi-methylated DNA and delivers the methyl group leading to total maintenance methylation patterns through cell division. and the same occurs in cancer. The sensitive periods occurs when the enviroment can affect epigenetic control and not in any stage of development of the person, thoses periods are : the period of germ cells  development, the preimplantation period. and as we saw, these are periods of active reprogramming of epigenetic marks. and is very important for the clinician to know that it is not advisable to use these drugs in patients who are in these sensitive periods, I mean pregnant patients in which your baby is in full swing and as mentioned earlier during these sensitive periods is taking place very active reprogramming of all these epigenetic marks within these methylation course and if we give these drugs to these patients can be transferred through the placental barrier via blood to the embryo or fetus and in the case of decitabine reduce methylation in this and to be going through these periods generate inadequate expression of certain genes that can lead to congenital malformations or death of the baby. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation in cancer si altered in many ways. As we know methylation in normal cells occurs in several regions of the genome between these CpG islands, and can be maintained through cell division, it is known that there are clusters of CpG on promoters and the methylation of these generally indicates that there will be silencing its expression by blocking the binding of certain transcription factors, and is important to know that CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation ,but in cancer we found that the opposite occurs, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands in specific locus where many  tumor suppressors genes are silenced, and have generally been found modifications in epigenetic control in all cancers studied and it very strikingly that there are more hypermethylation of tumor suppressors genes that mutations . The oncogenesis occurs because of this hypermethylation of Tumor suppressors, one example of this event is the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancer, we know that this genes help to repair DNA that have double-stranded breaks, and when this genes have mutations or  hypermethylation there is a very high chance that the person develops breast or ovarian cancer during his life. Otherwise, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually unmethylated in normal cells, and its function is to maintain genomic integrity by various mechanisms mentioned in the first week of the course  but in cancer cells what happens is that there are hypomethylation of these regions, generating genomic instability, that leads to the generation of genetic aberrations such as deletions, translocations and chromosomal insertions finally generating oncogenesis and is something that is very common in cancer cells </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This cluster is control by enhancer blocking, It is known that normally the imprinted control region (ICR) in the maternal allele is unmethylated and in the paternal allele is methylated. First in the maternal allele, we found that a insulator protein called (CTCF) can bind to this regionand what happens is that this protein insulates the Igf2 gene being activated by the downstream enhancers, H19 is not relevant. if we talk about the paternal allele we found that this cromosome is imprinted because of the methylation and CTCF cannot bind ICR and this allows binding of enhancers which activate Igf2, therefore only Igf2 is activated in the paternal allele and not in the maternal allele. Igf2 is a oncogene, but rather it has a very important functions in normal physiology inducing prliferation in development. taking this into account, we see that when this upregulated this generated oncogenesis processes. In Wilms tumour , biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed; this can be due to many factors and generated that the maternal allele behaves as paternal allele, and this overexpresion of Igf2 leads abnormal cellular proliferation. We see this not only in cancer but also in many disorders such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Silver-Russell syndrome depending on many factors</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine is part of DNAmethyltransferases inhibitors (DNMTi) and one of the few currently approved by the FDA . This DNMTi are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The action mechanism by which these drugs lower methylation through inhibition of DNAmetiltransferases and this is achieved because they are nucleoside analogues and in each cell replication when joining the DNMT the retain and prevent its function and therefore can derepress silenced tumor suppressor genes and restore their normal function, because they are dependent on cell division, cancer that is excessive cell proliferation is the perfect target. This drugs can induce functional re-expression of aberrantly silenced genes in cancer, causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells.  Is important to remember that in the 70 high dose was used which generated toxicity, but currently at low doses can be achieved antineoplastic effect, also is relevant to have a lack of specificity but this patients rarely respond extremely well and tolerate this therapy.</p></div>
