    <div class="field-value"><p>There are wide-spread differences in the DNA methylation patterns in the genomes of normal and cancer cells.  <br /><br />CpG islands are often found in gene promoters, and methylation of the CpG islands is associated with silencing of the corresponding genes.  In normal cells, these CpG islands are generally unmethylated, and so gene expression takes place.  In cancer cells, howver, CpG islands tend to be methylated, and the corresponding genes are silenced. Since tumour suppressor genes are often silenced in this way, cancer cell growth is less inhibited, and tumours can grow without the normal constraints experinced by normal cells. Furthermore, since methylation patterns are mitotically inherited, there is selection pressure in cancer cells for effective silencing of the tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated.  The methylation in intergenic regions leads to greater genomic stability, and reduces the rates of insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations. In both intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the methylation helps to prevent cryptic transcription and illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, on the other hand, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically unmethylated. This results in genomic instability and a much higher rate of deletions, insertions, duplications and reciprocal translocations. These modifications can compromise the expression patterns of the genes necessary for normal cell behaviour.<br /><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is critical in establishing parental imprinting on alleles. In normal cells, the imprinting control region associated with an imprinted gene is methylated on one allele and unmethylated on the other allele, which results is different gene expression from the two alleles.<br /><br />Consider the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele. On the maternal allele, the unmethylated state allows binding of the CTCF insulator protein which prevents enchancers from trigging expression from the Igf2 gene, and encourages expression of the H19 gene. On the paternal allele, however, the methylated state prevents binding of CTCF, and the enhancers promote the expression of Igf2, while the H19 gene is silenced by spreading methylation.  As a result, Igf2 is active on the paternal allele, while H19 is active on the maternal allele.<br /><br />In cancer cells, at the H19/Igf2 cluster, both alleles are typically methylated, and behave like paternal alleles. The Igf2 gene is over-expressed, and H19 is under-expressed. Since the Igf2 gene codes for a growth promoter protein, over-production of the protein encourages the unhibited growth patterns characteristic of cancer cells and tumour growth.   <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  Inhibiting the action of DNA methyltransferase slows the remethylation of copied DNA strands after cell division, and thereby reduces methylation across the genome. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, the effects of the drug are felt most strongly in growing tumours.<br /><br />As a result of lower methylation genome-wide, the CpG islands in particular are les methylated. CpG islands are often found in gene promoters, and their methylation is associated with silencing of the associated genes. Consequently, the use of the Decitabine promotes normal gene expression in tumours.<br /><br />This is particularly important in the case of tumour suppressor genes, which are often silenced in tumour cells. The use of Decitabine helps to prevent silencing of these genes, and so uninhibited tumour growth is prevented or reduced. <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome, since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. After cell division, DNA methyltransferases recreated the methylation patterns from the original strand to the copied strand. As a result, DNA methylation changes are passed on to all descendants.<br /><br />A sensitive period is a period during the development of an organism when epigenetic marks are being established or modified. In mammals, there is a sensitive period during early embryonic development, before implantation in the uterus, when epigenetic marks are all removed to produce pluripotent stem cells, and then re-established as part of the process of cell differentiation. There is a second sensitive period during the development of the primordial germ cells, when epigentic marks are removed and re-established in an imprinted fashion.<br /><br />Administering epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable, since the drugs would interfere with the normal mechanisms that clear and re-establish the epigenetic marks. The results could include improper clearing of epigenetic marks, improper establishment of epigenetic marks and loss of imprinting. All of these would be harmful to the organism since they would alter the normal patterns of gene expression.<br /><br /></p></div>
