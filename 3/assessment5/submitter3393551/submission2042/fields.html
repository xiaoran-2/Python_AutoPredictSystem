    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of cytosine to 5-methyl cytosine occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. CpGs cluster into CpG islands which predominantly occur at gene promoters and a largely unmethylated. DNA methylation at CpG islands results in silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>During development CpG island at gene promoters at methylated resulting in X inactivation, imprinting genes and long term transcription silencing.</p>
<p>In  cancer cells,  CpG islands at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated, thus silencing their transcription. This leads to cell reproduction that is no longer controlled and subsequenty tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated which maintains genome integrity. Methylation at  intergenic regions is thought to silent cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. In repetitive elements, methylation results in silencing of repeats and mutation of repeats (from meC to T)  to prevent transposition.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at intergenic regions activates cryptic promoters and at repetitive elements it activates repeats and transposition. This increases genomic instability, increases mutations (insertions, deletions, transpositions) affecting protein function, and increases or reduces gene expression, affecting protein balance. Where this increases activation of oncogenes and/or reduction of functional tumour suppressors, uncontrolled cell growth could ensue, followed by tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genetic imprinting determines whether a gene is expressed based on the parent of origin. An example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster and  its interaction with the protein CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from enhances downstream. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which blocks CTCF binding and allows the enhancers to activate expression of Igf2.  The H19 promoter is also methylated which silences expression of H19.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, there is no methylation at the ICR, CTCF is expressed and blocks the enhancers and silences expression of Igf2. The H19 promoter is not methylated so H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, a form of embryonic kidney cancer, imprinting is disrupted by hypermethylation, as the maternal chromosome takes on the imprinting of the paternal allele. That is,  the maternal ICR is methylated as well as the paternal. This results in a decrease in expression of the mRNA H19 and an increase in the growth factor Igf2. Igf2 promotes cell growth whereas H19 suppresses growth. With H19 silenced, and Igf2 overexpressed, uncontrolled cell growth occurs, leading to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  belongs to the  is a DNMT inhibitor  class of drugs. It inhibits DNA methyltransferases which methylate hemimethylated Cpg di-nucleotides during mitosis This dilutes DNA methylation at each cell divisions occur.  Hypermethylation at  CpG islands at promoters of tumor suppressors results in silencing of these genes, uncontrolled cell growth leading to tumorigenesis.    <br /><br /> Myelodysplastic Syndrome which progresses to Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is characterised by uncontrolled growth of white blood cells. Decitabine is used to treat this disease by reducing DNA methylation, genome-wide, which will have the effect of removing methylation of CpG islands at tumor-suppressor cell promoters, which can counteract the uncontrolled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained by DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs). Methylation is maintained  in dividing somatic cells and the methylation is copied to the newly created DNA strands. The methylated cytosine is detected and DNMTs add a methyl group to the complimentary strand. in this way the epigenome is maintained through mitosis.</p>
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming is the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks to restore the totipotency. Sensitive periods are periods where epigenetic reprogramming, for example DNA methylation,  takes place in cells, .</p>
<p>This includes early development where DNA methylation is removed and primordial germ cell development where methylation marks are reset (differently in spermatogenesis from oogenesis).</p>
<p>It would therefore be inadvisable to treat young patients where germ cells are under development and epigenetic marks are being laid down.  Drug induced alteration of DNA methylation during this period will affect these germ cells and have a, possibly adverse,  effect on the epigenome of the next generation.</p></div>
