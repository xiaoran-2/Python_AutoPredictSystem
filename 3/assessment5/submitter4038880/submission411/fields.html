    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands ( and +/- 2 kb) are generally hypomethylated regions. In cancer, these regions appear to be more likely methylated, which contributes to the silencing of différent tumor supressor genes that these regions contain. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes prevents the normal fonctioning of the cell machinery in regards to division because it increases the total number of mutations during replication of the cell. Since DNA methylation is mytotically heritable and epimutations can be rapidly selected it contributes directely to the progression of disease. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally high methylated regions of the genome. This confers stability to these regions and contributes to stabllsh the general epigenetic code of the genome, which has a regulatory fonction for the normal fonctionning of the cell. They are hypomethylated in cancer, gradually from the firsts states of hyperplasia to metastatic cancer cells. When these regions are hypomethylated, their stability decreases and recombination, transposition, disruption of genes, delections and other aberrations can occur much often, imparing the normal fonctioning of the cell within the tissue.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation on impriting control regions appear both in the sens of hypermethylation and hypomethylation, depending on the genes and tissues implicated. The result is that, instead of an imprinted expression, we find either the expression of both allele or silencing of both allele. It's a common and early event in cancer since many of imprinted genes are involved in growth. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>The ICR of the cluster H19/Igf2 is methylated in the paternal allele (paternal imprinting). This methylation avoids CTCF binding (insulator protein). Without CTCF, methylation spreads to H19 promoter and this allows the enhancers to act upstream over Ifg2, promoting his expression.</p>
<p>The same region is non-methylated in the maternal allele, CTCF binds the ICR, and this protein insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers on the maternal allele, which act over H19 instead.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting, both ICR are hypermethylated, both Ifg2 expressed, and there's then a double dose of Igf2, a growth promoting gene implicated in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which belongs to the enzymatic regulators group, and acts like a DNA demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitors). It behaves like a nucleoside analog, gets incorporated upon DNA during replication and therefore bound irreversivily the DNMT enzym when it comes to act during replication, avoiding his activity on the cell. </p>
<p>Since cancer cells multiply more, they are more affected in this process (anti-tumor effect) specially in haematological malignancies, in which hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes appear to be implicated. The exact mechanism of action is neverthless still unclear.</p>
<p> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic signature is stablish during developement and maintained later through division in each type of cell, which a certain level of plasticity over the years, due in part to environemental effects. When you use a drug that affects the epigenetic machinery, you are potentially remodelling the fonctioning of different types of cells all over the body, and these, in a permanent way, since epigenetic changes, once stablished, are mytotically heritables along the cell life, unless they are actively erased. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is the developpemental window when the epigenetic signature of a cell is reprogrammed. It occurs mainly in two moments, during early developpement (fertilised egg) and during the stablishement of cellular lineage. </p>
<p>In cancer, epigenetic treatements can stop the process of "aberrant replication" of the cell without killing the cell. Nevertheless, used during sensitive periods, they can misregulate the whole fonctioning of the epigenetic machinery all over the tissues, causing a lot of damage!</p></div>
