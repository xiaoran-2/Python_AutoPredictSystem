    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a hypométhylant belonging to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>* Decitabine is a drug that acts to prevent methylation . It incorporates mainly in DNA after phosphorylation.  After incorporation, it forms a covalent bond with the DNMT may cause cell death by blocking DNA synthesis. DNMTs become inactive and after several replications, a significant demethylation was observed. So, this drug inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and produces a global hypomethylation affecting all human cells.</p>
<p>* Decitabine Can Have an anti-tumor effect. Grace epigenetic therapy, its role hypomethylant was acquired. This drug has also been active in moderate doses in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). These anti-tumor actions resulted in the reactivation of silent genes (tumor suppressor genes) and differentiation of the cell cycle at low doses, and cytotoxicity at high doses. It can also inhibit DNA hypermethylation at low doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* Epigenetic changes are transmitted during cell division the daughter cells to granddaughters until they are actively erased. Once deleted, however, they do not return. It proves to be that epigenetic treatments may to make changes that impede the progression of a cancer without having to kill all the cells. So this could be explained by the fact that extremely long and durable tumor treatment exposure. This will lead the more initially responsive primary tissues to be other anti-tumor drug.</p>
<p>* Sensitive period for reprogramming  are<strong> </strong>early embryonic development and primordial gem cell development.<strong></strong></p>
<p>* In early development, paternal genome is actively and rapidly demyethylated and maternal genome is passive DNA demethylation, in primordial germ cell development, the resetting mark in germ cell are different DNA methylation in spermatogenesis vs oogenesis.</p>
<p>* The treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because this period is under the influence of the environment. if you disrupt them by altering the environment in which they happen, or you speed them up or avoid them entirely with any of these processes. Then obviously this has consequences for how efficiently the reprogramming occurs.</p></div>
