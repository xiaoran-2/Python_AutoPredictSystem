    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands</strong> are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. However, objective definitions for CpG islands are limited. The usual formal definition of a CpG island is a region with at least 200 bp, and a GC percentage that is greater than 50%, and with an observed-to-expected CpG ratio that is greater than 60.</p>
<p>In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for epigenetic therapy.</p>
<p>DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer. The total amount of methylated cytosine is usually decreased resulting in global hypomethylation. Decreased cytosine methylation typically affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences, and CpG sites located in gene bodies (introns and inner exons).</p>
<p>An <strong>Intergenic region </strong>is a stretch of DNA sequences located between genes.Intergenic regions are a subset of Noncoding DNA. Occasionally some intergenic DNA acts to control genes nearby, but most of it has no currently known function.</p>
<p>In cancer these regions tend to become hypomethylated so they have less methylation than would be seen in a normal cell.</p>
<p>Cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation is as prevalent as cancer-linked hypermethylation, but these two types of epigenetic abnormalities usually seem to affect different DNA sequences. Much more of the genome is generally subject to undermethylation rather than overmethylation. Genomic hypermethylation in cancer has been observed most often in CpG islands in gene regions. In contrast, very frequent hypomethylation is seen in both highly and moderately repeated DNA sequences in cancer, including heterochromatic DNA repeats, dispersed retrotransposons, and endogenous retroviral elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>H19</strong> is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, found in humans and elsewhere. This gene seems to have a role in some forms of cancer. The H19 gene is expressed exclusively on one parental allele in a phenomenon known as imprinting.H19 is only transcribed from the maternally inherited allele; the paternal H19 allele is not expressed.  </p>
<p>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and is unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When it's unmethylated CTCF 4 bind is an insulator element, it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there is no expression.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and Igf2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p>However, with loss of imprinting and high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now then there is also have expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Now there is a double dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm's tumour. Wilm’s tumour or nephroblastoma is cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children,</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents in the form of azacitidine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>In combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor  it has slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma.</p>
<p>Like all epigenetic approaches Decitabine attmepts to prevent the overactivity of methylates histones and thus silences the genes they surround, including so-called tumour-suppressor genes whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who showed limited response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed following epigenetic therapy. Although it is too early in this line of research to say for sure, Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>With the epigenome there are sensitive periods when the environment is more able to influence epigenetic makeup.  The period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms seems to be one sensitive period.</p>
<p>The second sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Both of these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the sensitive period, for example, with younger patients, it would be’ one very large insult’ to the environment at the time of its greatest influence to be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
