    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Usually in a normal cell you will find that at CpG islands are unmethylated, or hypomethylated, so the imprinting of the paternal allele is correct and thus establishing its origin and imprinting suitable for it.</p>
<p>  DNA methylation appears to function as a epigenetic transformation which differently marks the alleles and gives way to transcription of genes, either by repressing it or by expressing it.</p>
<p>  In cancer cells you would find that there is a cross transfer between the methylation in the CpG islands and transgenic positions, ICR, and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>  DNA methylation in repetitive elements and intergenic regions will enable the genome (most of its part is formed by repetitive elements and intergenic regions) to remain stable.</p>
<p>  When you refer to a genome which is cancer related you will find that hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to:illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and thus disruption of neighboring genes.</p>
<p>  Disruption of DNA methylation leads to genomic instabillity, contributes to chromosomal instabillity, depletion of DNA methylation leads to enhance tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p>
<p> In a normal cell you have a methylation spreading along the paternal allele in ICR and on the Igf 2 cluster, thus enabling the expression of the Igf 2, by using the promoters.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind there, silencing the Igf 2 and promoting H19.</p>
<p>  Due to loss of imprinting in Wilm's tumour case you have an overexpression of Igf 2, due to hypermethylation of ICR in the maternal allele, so you have an ICR region in the maternal allele which is no longer insulated by the CTCF and thus promoting the expression of a growth factor, mainly the Igf 2 both on the maternall allele and paternal one.</p>
<p>  In conclusion, due to loss of imprinting, mainly by hypermethylating the ICR on the maternal allele, you have a non-insulated ICR in the maternal side, which enables the expression of Igf 2, a growth factor and silences the expression of H19.You can say that in this case you have an overexpression of a growth promoting gene and the silencing of the growth control one.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine (Dacogen<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;">®</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"> trade name)</span> is a newly developped drug, it's a cytydine analog (<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:sans-serif;"><span><strong>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</strong></span></span></span> ), mainly a hypomethylathing agent,acting to inhibit DNMT, thus hypomethylathing DNA.</p>
<p>  It is designed to act as an inhibtior, after suffering a process of phosphorylation it incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNMT, it restores normal functions to genes which command cell proliferation and differentiation by hypomethylating the DNA.</p>
<p>  In an abnormal cell, mainly a cancer cell  a methylation leads to loss of binding Me CpG 2 proteins which mediates the transcriptiom silencing of oncogenes, thus enabling the proliferation of abnormal cells.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> You can say that alterring DNA methylation you could turn on and off genes and reactivate the ones that are normally active expressed.</p>
<p>After cell division the newly created cells will share the same degree of DNA methylation as found in the mother cell, the one treated with an epigenetic drug, so you have a lasting effect which takes advantage of the dynamic epigenome and whom outlives the period of administration of the drug itself.</p>
<p> A sensitive period can be defined as a period when all epigenetic marks are erased, and  active reprogramming of the genome is at its height, in the early stages of embriogenesis amd early germ cell development. after fertilization and below 1000 days of child development, also in the period of prepuberty 8-10 years in female and 9-12 years, during pregnancy.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable as in this stages an exposure to an epigenetic drug could result in a permanent effect, targetting as well as tumour cell and normal ones, so modifying in these sensitive periods could affect all the normal cells in the long run and thus affecting their normal development.  </p></div>
