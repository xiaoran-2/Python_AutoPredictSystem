    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster comprises the <strong>H19</strong> long non-coding RNA and the <strong>Igf2</strong> gene. The Imprint Control Region (<strong>ICR</strong>) lies in between H19 and Igf2. Downstream from H19 are enhancers and these activate expression of either H19 or Igf2, depending on the methylation state of the ICR</p>
<ul><li>The H19/Igf2 Cluster is paternally imprinted: in other words, the ICR is methylated. The CTCF insulator protein cannot bind to the methylated ICR and this enables the  downstream enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene and enable Igf2 expression. Thus Igf2 is expressed from the paternal cluster (and H19 is not expressed).</li>
<li>In contrast, there is lack of methylation at the ICR on the maternally inherited cluster, enabling CTCF to bind to the ICR. This binding insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. Hence Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal cluster (H19 is instead expressed).</li>
</ul><ul><li>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR in the maternally inherited H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated.</li>
<li>ICR hypermethylation of the maternally inherited H19/Igf2 cluster effectively makes it act like the paternal cluster, which expresses the Igf2 gene. Igf2 expression is thus doubled. Igf2 being a growth promoter, doubling of expression of Igf2 causes cancer.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<ul><li>Decitabine belongs to a class of inhibitor drugs targeting <strong>enzymatic epigenetic regulators</strong> that lay down or remove epigenetic marks such as methylation. Specifically, Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor targeting the enzyme DNMT1. </li>
<li>Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analogue and gets incorporated into the DNA when DNA replicates. When DNMT1 binds hemi-methylated DNA daughter stands that have Decitabine incorporated in them (to lay down the methylation mark), its gets bound to the DNA irreversibly and gets degraded. Decitabine action is thus dependent on DNA replication. Its action reverses the epigenetic hypermethylation that induces silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</li>
<li>Since Cancer cells are dividing rapidly, these are most affected by Decitabine. While the exact mechanism by which Decitabine affects is not known, Decitabine induced demethylation seems to reverse the epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes, leading to control of cell proliferation. This is how Decitabine causes an anti-tumour effect.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands usually occur near gene promoters and DNA methylation at CpG islands typically causes silencing of gene expression. </p>
<ul><li>In normal cells, a small subset of these CpG islands are dynamically methylated between cell types. Also, CpG islands in the inactive X-chromosome in females are methylated, causing silencing of  genes in the inactivated X chromosome. However, most of the CpG islands are <strong>protected</strong> from DNA methylation.</li>
<li>In cancer cells, CpG islands that are normally unmethylated are found to hypermethylated; further, CpG island hypermethylation varies by tumour type.</li>
<li>The hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells tends to be found in promoters of tumour suppressor genes, leading to their silencing, and in turn this leads to cell proliferation and tumour formation. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and thus the silencing of tumour suppressor gene persists: such cells have the advantage of being rapidly selected for compared to neighbouring cells, thus causing tumourogenesis.</li>
<li>In normal cells, we find DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This serves to promote genomic stability. For example, DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides will lead to mutation of C to T: this mutagenic effect will disrupt transposition.</li>
<li>However, in cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated</li>
<li>Hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions causes genomic instability, a common feature of various tumour types. Genomic instability can occur due to various reasons: 1) Hypomethylation of repeats activates transposons that can disrupt other genes, causing gene malfunction which can lead to disease. 2) Hypomethylation of repeats can also lead to illegal recombination. 3) Hypomethylation of cryptic promoters leads to disruption of transcription of nearby genes. 4) Hypomethylation can also cause inadvertent transcription of neighbouring genes, which can cause disease. All of these genomic instabilities are found to occur in cancer cells.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA Methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark: it is passed down to daughter and granddaughter cells and is stable. If a drug alters DNA methylation state, the altered state will stably persist on its own. It is this mitotic heritability that causes alterations in DNA methylation to cause a stable and enduring change in the epigenome.  </li>
<li>Sensitive period refers to the two periods of major epigenetic reprogramming, when the epigenome as a whole is sensitive to changes in the environment, including changes in diet. </li>
<li>The two primary sensitive periods of development are: 1) Period from germ cell development to the production of matures egg/sperm 2) The pre-implantation and early post implantation period of the embryo. During these periods of active epigenetic reprogramming, existing epigenetic marks are either being removed and/or new marks are being laid down.  </li>
<li>Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would likely disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming of the Inner Cell Mass (during early embryo development), the primordial germ cells as well as the gametes. This disruption of epigenetic marks may persist during the lifetime of the individual and can lead to disease. Hence it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</li>
