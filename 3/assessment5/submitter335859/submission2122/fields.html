    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hypomethylation and hyper methylation are both observed in cancer, and may in some cases abet cancer growth.</p>
<p>In normal tissue, CpG islands tend to be located near gene promoters. DNA methylation at these CpG sites leads to gene silencing and enables flexible control of gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG island hypermethylation has been observed, particularly in regions near tumor suppressor genes. Loss of tumor suppressor pathways grants selective advantage to mutant cells; that is, cancerous cells that lower expression of tumor suppressor genes via hypermethylation become more dangerous.</p>
<p>As for intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation normally serves to prevent expression of foreign DNA and induce heterochromatin. In their condensed states, repetitive elements are both less likely to be erroneously expressed and to undergo undesirable recombination or translocation among the repetitive elements on the same or different chromosomes.</p>
<p>In cancer, a general loss of epigenetic marks leads to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. These changes cause genomic instability and increase the likelihood of gross pathologies of karyotypes and genomic architecture. Loss of chromosome arms can mean the loss of tumor suppressor functions; the translocation of proto-oncogenes to actively transcribed regions can promote growth. Wild, rapid changes to the genome are commonly found in cancers and are therefore presumed to be important for cancer progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal H19 allele is methylated whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated.</p>
<p>Methylation in the father prevents CTCF binding upstream of H19. Because CTCF is not bound, it cannot insulate lgf2 from the nearby enhancers, and lgf2 is expressed in the father. In the mother, the absence of methylation allows CTCF to bind and forces nearby enhances to promote expression of H19 rather than lgf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, lgf2, an oncogene, is overexpressed due to possessing two 'paternal' alleles instead of one from each parent. When both alleles are unmethylated, lgf2 is expressed on both copies and therefore leads to an abundance of oncogene expression. Basically, expression profiles of genes in the H19 locus rely on imprinting to reach the correct expression level, and removing that information results in aberrant growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. This means that it is functionally a DNA demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine may have its anticancer effect due to demethylating tumor suppressor genes that some cancers have silenced (by hypermethylation) in order to spread. Once the tumor suppressor's expression is restored, the cancer can no longer expand. It is also possible that DNA demethylation is generally toxic because of cellular dependence on epigenetic monitoring for survival. Because cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, they are most prone to these toxic effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so treatment with an epigenetic drug at any point in one's lifetime can lead to a stable change in epigenetic marks, passed on from cell to cell.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time when epigenetic marks are being reset by specific developmental processes. The term alludes to the fact that epigenetic state is easily changed during these times, and is inherited mitotically afterward. Exposing patients to chemicals that modify epigenetic marks will cause the most radical change during these periods, which occur during early embryonic development and germ cell development in humans.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods (i.e., during pregnancy) would be very risky because complex cellular processes are responsible for laying down appropriate epigenetic marks that will be critical for proper growth and development for the rest of the developing person's life, and they are not easily modified after these sensitive periods, even if we did have the tools to fix any undesired modifications.</p></div>
