    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGs are clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters of genes, where the transcription machinery, such as transcription factors, bind. So, CpG islands are usually protected from methylation, as if methylated it will silence the gene. Thus, most CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer, there is locus specific hypermethylation at CpG islands. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes and genes that contribute to apoptosis, which can be features of cancer. DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis, as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. This maintains genomic integrity. In cancer there is genome-wide hypomethylation. So, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability (deletion/ duplication/ insertion/ reciprocal translocations) due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. This can lead to proto-oncogenes turning into oncogenes. It also activates genes that produce proteins, which sustain proliferative signaling. It can also make it more likely that the gametes of the affected individual suffer a chromosomal abnormality and so their offspring will suffer as a result.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTFC is an insulator protein, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. In the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprint control region stops the CTFC from binding. So, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing it, and enhancers can access Igf2, activating it. In the maternal allele, there is no methylation at the imprint control region, so Igf2 is insulated from downstream enhancers and thus it is silent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the maternal allele is mutated or has deleted parts, it can behave like the paternal allele if there is a loss of the CTFC gene, leading to an overdose of Igf2 in the affected individual. This is called uniparental disomy, and can be a cause of Wilm’s tumour. Wilm’s tumour can be a part of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which can be due to imprinting disorder at the H19/Igf2 cluster. This condition leads to foetal and post-natal overgrowth, macroglossia and a predispostion to embryonic and childhood tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent {a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)}. DNMTs irreversibly bind to Nucleoside analogues. DNMT3a and DNMT3b laid down methylation during development, and as DNA replication is semi-conservative, only 1 strand on each new DNA double helix has the methyl groups. This is usually the substrate for DNMT1, however Decitabine prevents that from happening. So, the drug is replication dependent and so will more severely affect cancer cells. It can also resulting in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes, such as tumour suppressor genes. Also, the epigenetic drug may be able to alter tumour cells in to make them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMT3a and DNMT3b laid down methylation during development, and only 1 strand on each new DNA double helix has the methyl groups after semi-conservative DNA replication. DNA-demethylating agents prevent DNMT1 from methylating the hemi-methylated DNA. So, It can result in the expression of a previously hypermethylated silenced genes. It can have an enduring effect, as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so all the daughter cells of that cell will now have the same DNA methylation pattern. A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being established, such as primordial germ cell development and early development, and so altered environments can have an effect on epigenetic machinery. Another such sensitive periods can be slow growth periods, which is between the ages of 9 to 12 in males and 8 to 10 in females. It would be inadvisable to treat them during these sensitive periods, as it could alter the epigenome of the gametes by either preventing the epigenome to be cleared completely or by resetting the epimarks incorrectly, which could lead to uniparental disomy in the offspring, which leads to diseases such as Beckwith- Wiedemann syndrome, Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.</p></div>
