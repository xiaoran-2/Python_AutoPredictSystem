    <div class="field-value"><p>      Normal DNA methylation is altered so drastically in cancer that aberrant methylation can be used for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  An overall lose of methylation, which increases as the cancer grows, occurs to some degree in all tumor types.  This genome-wide hypomethylation is of consequence at the intergenic and the repeat regions where methylation is essential for the genomic stability of healthy cells.  In the intergenic regions methylation silences cryptic splice sites and cryptic promoters to prevent disruption in the transcription of neighboring genes.  Methylation of repetitive regions results in a tight chromatin structure with reduced DNA accessibility that prevents aligning segments of repeats from mutating through reciprocal translocations.  Without methylation the intergenic and repeat regions become sites of mutagenesis.</p>
<p>     In contrast to hypomethylation at intergenic and repeat regions, methylation increases at imprint control regions and the promoter regions of tumor suppressing genes in cancer.  The CpG islands and CpG island shores of these promoters are unmethylated in health cells enabling transcription machinery to bind for transcription of the adjacent tumor-suppressing gene.  The hypermethylation of specific CpG islands in cancer silences the associated gene by preventing transcription.  Silencing of these genes involved in controlling cell division, cell death, and DNA repair facilitates tumor progression.  Although the particular CpG islands that show hypermethylation differ by tumor type, the degree of methylation at hypermethylated CpG islands can be used for prognosis, with higher methylation correlating to more advanced cancers in all tumor types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrations in the methylation of imprint control regions can contribute to cancer by altering the gene expression on either a maternal or paternal allele so that either expression of a growth-restricting gene lost or expression of a growth-promoting gene is enhanced.  For example, a malignant tumor in the kidney called Wilm’s tumor can be caused by the overexpression of the growth-promoting gene Igf2 when the correct imprint marks on the maternal allele are lost.  In normal cells the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternally inherited allele so that Igf2 is expressed, but unmethylated on the maternally inherited allele so that H19 is expressed instead of Igf2.  Hypermethylation of this imprint control region causes the loss of maternal imprinting, so both alleles behave like paternal alleles and the patient gets a double dose of growth promotion from Igf2 expression, which often leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors that are DNA-demethylating agents.  The ability of decitabine to remove a methyl (CH3-) group from DNA has therapeutic potential for cancers in which tumor-suppressing genes have been silenced by excessive methylation of CpG islands associated with the promoter regions of those genes.  Removal of methylation at these CpG islands that have become inappropriately hypermethylated could re-activate genes that normally control cell division, cell death, or DNA repair, any of which would work against the progression of a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>     Epigenetic drugs are potentially more promising and more dangerous than traditional therapies because the changes they create in methylation patterns are mitotically heritable, meaning that both daughter cells after cell division will inherit those altered epigenetic marks, allowing the new epigenetic marks to persist indefinitely without continuing treatment. </p>
<p>     Physicians should be the most cautious when considering epigenetic treatments for a pregnant woman, possibly pregnant woman, or a pre-pubescent girl because the fetus, during pre-implantation and primordial germ cell development, or the immature oocytes in her body are in a so-called “sensitive” periods where methylation has been removed from the DNA so that normal epigenetic reprogramming can occur.  While regions of DNA are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming the cellular mechanisms for somatic maintenance of epigenetic marks must be turned off, leaving those regions more vulnerable to environmental insults.  Caution should also be used with any patient intending to have children.  Since the patient’s somatic cell and germ cells will both be subject to epigenetic changes during and beyond the treatment, even though they are not a vulnerable as cells during sensitive periods, the treatment could have adverse consequences for more than one person. </p></div>
