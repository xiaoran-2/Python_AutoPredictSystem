    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis of imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, formation of heterochromatin.  In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are metylated, but the CpGs in the promoter are unmethylated. This allows the transcription of these genes (tumor supressor genes), and the formation of euchromatin. In normal cells the oncogenes are silenced by methylation on CpGs in their promoters. In cancer cells CpGs in the promoters of tumor supressor genes are hypermethylated and these genes are silenced or oncogenes are activated by hypomethylation CpG poor promoters or intergene regions which cause genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes. This is a nucleoside analogue that inhibit DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases). Decitabine irraversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated to the DNA (nucleoside analogues incorporate to the DNA through cell division, in the process of replication of the DNA). Tumor cells divide fast, so the incorporation of Decitabine is fast, and becouse of the inhibition of DNMTs the genes are not methyalted. So the tumor supressor genes are activated.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpGs in the promoter on the paternal allele are methylated. It allows to enhancers activate expression of Igf2. On the maternal allele, CpGs are not methylated, so it allows the binding of CTCF to the promoter. It causes the expression of H19 gene, but not the Igf2. In Wilm's tumor, the methylation pattern changed on the maternal allele. So, there are two sets of active Igf2 gene (the maternal allele has the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele). This causes overexpression of Igf2 in Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA is, like other epigenetic marks, is mitoticaly inherited. So, if it changed in one cell, his daughter and grand-doughter cells will have the same epigenetic marks, in this case DNA methylation. Sensitive periods is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: cleaning and resetting of epigenetic marks, like periods of pre-implantational devlopement and period of germ cell development. Treating patients in these periods is inadvisable because the epigenetic marks are cleaned, so if we inhibit the enzymes, the methylation normally presented in the cell will not be done.</p></div>
