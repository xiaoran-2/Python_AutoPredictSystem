    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated which allows tumor suppressor genes to express. In contrast, CpG islands in a cancer cell are frequently hypermethylated. The hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Without expression of tumor suppressor genes, cells undergo uncontrolled growth resulting in cancer.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated which provides stability to the genome. On the contrary, hypomethylation are frequently found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a cancer cell. This type of hypomethylation leads to genomic instability which includes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. The genomic instability can result in the abnormal growth of cells, leading to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, Imprinting Control Region (ICR) of the H19/lgf2 cluster of the paternal allele is hypermethylated. CTCF does not bind to the hypermethylated ICR which allows the enhancers to work on the expression of the lgf2 gene. In other words, the lgf2 gene of the paternal allele is expressed.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, ICR of the H19/lgf2 cluster of the maternal allele is hypomethylated. CTCF binds to the hypomethylated ICR. The CTCF bound ICR blocks the enhancers’ access to the lgf2 gene. So the lgf2 gene of the maternal allele is not expressed.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a normal cell, there is only one dose of lgf2 expression and it is from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In the tumor cell of a patient suffering from Wilm’s tumor, imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted: ICR of both the paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated. Therefore, lgf2 genes on both paternal and maternal alleles are expressed, i.e. the gene is over-expressed with double dosage. Lgf2 is growth promoting and overexpression leads to Wilm’s tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors referred to as DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>It works by inhibiting enzymes that methylate DNA and/or histone proteins. In other words, this drug reduces DNA methylation, i.e. hypomethylate DNA.</p>
<p>Cancer can be caused by hypermethylation of histone proteins. Hypermethylated histone proteins can inhibit the expression of tumor suppressing genes, thus leading to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. Decitabine may undo the hypermethylation of histone proteins, thus allowing the normal expression of tumor suppressor genes to fight cancer. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are heritable. They are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>This also means that epigenetic changes are passed onto germ cells during the sensitive period in which primordial germ cells are produced in the body of younger patients.</p>
<p>It is possible that epigenetic changes passed to primordial germ cells are in turn passed to all cells in the embryos. The effect on differentiated cells and at different stages of growth can be unpredictable. Therefore it would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs.</p>
