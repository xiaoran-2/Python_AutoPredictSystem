    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at promoters and are unmethylated. However, when methylated, silencing of gene expression occurs. This takes place by silencing the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and the prohibition of transcription factor binding that can alter gene expression.<br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated.<strong> </strong>DNA methylation leads to genomic integrity maintenance.<strong> </strong>The methylation of intergenic regions causes silencing of cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites too. The repetitive elements can be pasted on other parts of the genome and possibly disrupt genes. By methylating them this transposition can be prevented. Also, by silencing those regions we can avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and prevent possible recombination. Another way of preventing transposition is through the subsequent mutation of a CpG dinucleotide’s methylated cytosine to a thymine.<br /> In cancer there is a swap of the methylation at the regions mentioned. CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated. In this way, the hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumour suppressor genes, leading to the development of tumours. The hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements causes disruption to the neighbouring genes and activation of cryptic promoters. Also, it results in recombination between repeats as well as their activation and transposition.<br /> Having in mind the continuum of the normal tissue progression to hyperplasia, neoplasia and eventually invasion, we can describe the global level of methylation and CpG island methylation. The former is decreasing, while the later becomes denser.<br /> Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of CpG islands and intergenic regions/ repetitive elements, respectively, can lead to tumorigenesis depending on tumour type. Hypermethylation increases tumogenesis by silencing tumour suppressor genes. And on the contrary, hypomethylation increases tumorogenesis by disrupting the silencing of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and thus silenced. In this way, the enhancers can work on Igf2 and promote its production. However, H19 will not be produced because it is silenced. On the other hand, the ICR at the maternal allele is not methylated and therefore, a CTCF can bind to it. In this case, the enhancers are able to promote the expression of the H19 instead. Igf2 though will be silenced and not expressed. <br /> In Wilm’s tumour the maternal allele’s features are disrupted and are exactly as the paternal allele. The ICR of the maternal allele is methylated, thus leading to no H19 and more Igf2 expresssion. This is an example of hypermethylation that leads to the overexpression of Igf2. <br /> Igf2 is an oncogene that promotes growth and therefore when found in increased dosage growth will be disrupted. In the particular case of Wilm’s tumour, kidney tumours are developed in children. It occus at an early stage, at pre-neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is included in the class of DNA-demethylating agents (DNMT inhibitors). It is a nucleoside analogue that depends on replication. This is due to the fact that after DNMTS are combined with DNA, decatibine binds irreversibly to the DNMTs. <br /> Decitabine works in order to decrease DNA methylation and bring suppressor genes back to their normal function. This hypomethylation of DNA occurs via the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. The successful function of decitabine leads to the normal regulation of cell division and this will in turn result in the blockage of cancer. In the case of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which can be treated by decitabine, some genes that are responsible for differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis are inactivated because of DNA hypermethylation. Therefore, decitabine is used in order to hypomethylate these genes and bring everything back to normal, as mentioned before.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be maintained, in general, and passed on mitotically by Dnmt1. This happens because the hemi-methylated DNA strand, when a cell is dividing, can be used as a substrate for Dnmt1 and the methylation will be passed on to the daughter strand, thus being maintained in the genome. Hence, if the DNA methylation will be changed, it will be passed on with the same process.<br /> The sensitive periods of development are during epigenetic reprogramming. This is a very sensitive period and the disruption of the epigenetic reprogramming at this point can be harmful.<br /> The sensitive periods of development are during early development (pre-implantation period) and during primordial germ cell development. During these periods ICFI and IVF can take place as well as culture in vitro, embryo handling and germ cell harvest.<br /> During the sensitive periods totipotency needs to be restored, so the epigenetic marks have to be cleared. In this way, normal development can be achieved. Also, these periods are significant to the development of every being and any change/disruption will be passed on to all of its cells. Therefore, it is a very critical point in terms of survival and normal, successful growing.</p></div>
