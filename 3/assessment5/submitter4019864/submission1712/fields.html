    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> is methylation of 5’ group of a cytosine (C) residue within a 5’-CG-3’ (G=Guanine) dinucleotide repeat. CpG island is a cluster of such CG repeats. CpG islands usually occur at promoter start and their methylation by DNA methyl-transferases (DNMTs) leads to <strong>gene silencing</strong>. Specific Methyl CpG binding proteins (<strong>MeCP</strong>1 &amp; 2) recognize methylated residues by methyl binding domains and interact with various transcription repressors via other domains. DNA methylation can also cause Histone deacetylase to deacetylate histone proteins which then cause <strong>chromatin condensation</strong>, preventing transcription factors access. In case of cancer, a global decrease in DNA methylation (<strong>hypomethylation</strong>) has been observed especially at CpG poor promoters, repetitive regions and various imprint control regions (ICRs). This might be cause of high expression of oncogenes and various other genes involved in cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis etc. However, at specific loci <strong>hypermethylation</strong> has been observed (CpG islands, CpG island shores and ICRs). This can cause repression of various tumor suppressor genes eg. p53. Similar patterns of hyper- and hypo- methylation can also be involvedmany other diseases. Retinoblastoma gene hypermethylation can lead to retinoblastoma while that of R-RAS can cause gastric cancers. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually highly methylated for maintaining<strong> genomic stability</strong> by <em>preventing transposition, promoter interference and illegitimate recombination</em>.  Hypomethylation in these regions is associated with genomic instability causing diseases, which has been evidenced by studies in animal models and humans. The disruption in normal methylation may cause excessive transpositions or interference of strong promoters leading to expression of oncogenes or it can cause chromatin remodelling and decondensation providing sites for illegitimate recombination.  ICF is caused by DNMT3B mutation and hypomethylation of genome. Many cancers can also result due to these hypomethylations causing genomic instability and high expression of tumor genes (R-RAS). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster consists of four players: Igf2 gene, CTCF-dependant insulator, H19 gene and enhancers. In maternal allele CTCF binds to insulator sequences between Igf2 and H19 genes and insulate effect of enhancers upon Igf2. So <strong>H19</strong> is only <strong>maternal expressed</strong>. In paternal allele, imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and CTCF cannot bind to insulator sequences and causes H19 gene promoter methylation and silencing. So, enhancers now allow <strong>Igf2</strong> expression <strong>paternally</strong>. Further upstream is located <strong>linked</strong> cluster of genes including  Cdkn 1c and Kcnq1. On maternal allele ICR region inside Kcnq1 gene is methylated and so Cdkn1c gene is expressed. While in paternal allele ICR is not methylated and a long non-coding RNA (Kcnq1ot1) whose promoter is located inside ICR is also hypomethylated and transcribed. It then suppresses Cdkn1c by recruiting G9a and PRC2 that put H3K9me and H3K27me silencing marks.  <strong>Cdkn1c is growth and tumour suppressor while Igf2 is growth promoter (oncogene)</strong>.  Loss of epigenetic imprinting (mutation) and uniparental disomy can cause maternal allele to behave like paternal allele and cause Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome in which there is a predisposition to embryonic/ childhood tumour of kidney called Wilm’s tumour by <strong>increased Igf2 and decreased Cdkn1c</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <strong>DNA methylating agent</strong> and they tend to methylate nucleotide residues and therefore<strong> increase DNA methylation</strong> as a whole. These can be used to treat the tumours in which overall a hypomethylation in promoters (CpG islands) of those genes has occurred which can act as oncogenes such as those involved in growth and excessive cell division, evasion from apoptosis, angiogenesis and at later stages of cancers genes ivolved in metastasis. This however can also be applied in those tumors where hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions has led to illegitimate recombinations and aberrant transpositions.  These drugs can restore methylation status by excessive methylation leading to repression of oncogene expression (CpG methylation) and restoration of chromatin condensation and prevention of aberrant transpositions and recombinations by methylating intergenic and repetitive DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation controls the expression of genes and genomic stability. Altering DNA methylation can be employed for therapeutic purposes in a number of diseases including cancers. But, at the same time it can lead to alterations in methylation of non-target genes. So. limited and targeted methylation can be much more beneficial. DNA methylation by azacitidine for example can cause methylation of repetitive and intergenic DNA to increase genomic stability as well as repress oncogenes by methylation of CpG islands in their promoters. <strong>Sensitive period</strong> is the period in which once the epigenetic marks are removed and new marks are put. This is during primordial germ cell development, when the gametes are formed and just after the post-implantation embryo stage because epigenetic marks are completely removed from zygote to pre-implantation embryo stage. <strong>Young individuals</strong> in which germ cells are under development are inadvisable for DNA methylation alteration therapy (age 10-13 atleast)</p></div>
