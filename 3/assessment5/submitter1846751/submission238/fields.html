    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are generally unmethylated in normal mammalian tissue and they appear in the regulatory regions of many genes.  With many types of cancer, these islands become hypermethylated.  This switches off the genes concerned.  Switching off 1) inhibitors of oncogenes and 2) tumor suppressor genes allows can make a cell cancerous; since these epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, the cancer will grow and eventually metastesize.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal tissue repetitive elements and CpG's are usually methylated; this generally switches off harmful stretches of DNA.  In many types of cancer these regions become hypomethylated.  This causes genomic instability and activation of normally silent genes, including silenced oncogenes.  In addition unsilenced repeats can lead to transposition, illegitimate recombination, and disruption of neighboring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue the maternal CTCF region is umethylated while the paternal CTCF region is methylated.  Therefore the downstream promoters cause the maternal allele to produce H19 while the paternal allele makes igf2.  This is the normal pattern of imprinting.  In Wilm's tumor, the imprinting is lost and the maternal allele becomes methylated, so it also makes igf2:  then a double dose of igf2 is produced and igf2 is growth promoting.  This double igf2 production usually occurs at an early stage, so it might be a diagnostic marker before frank tumor growth occurs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent which inhibits DNA methyltransferase.  It has been approved by the FDA for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  Decitabine works by interfering with the methylation and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes, allowing these genes to be expressed and fight the tumor.  Decitabine is also an antimetabolite, causing the death of rapidly dividing cells which are more likely to be cancer than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If an epigenetic drug alters the DNA methylation state of genes in a cell, this effect is normally mitotically heritable.  In particular, if due to the drug oncogenes are silenced or tumor suppression genes are expressed, the resultant anti-tumor effects can persist well beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time when normally the epigenetic state is being altered, so treatment with an epigenetic drug might interefere with this process as well as the tumor.  The main sensitive periods are soon after conception, the blastocyst and primordial germ cell stages; however in females the primary oocytes are arrested in prophase 1 of their first meiosis and remain in this stage until puberty.  Therefore treatment of a possibly pregnant woman or a prepubescent girl with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable if better alternatives exist.</p>
