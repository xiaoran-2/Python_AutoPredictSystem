    <div class="field-value"><p>A CpG island can be defined as a cluster of CpG dinucleotides in the DNA. These clusters are often found at promoters of genes, and the methylation status can therefore influence the transcription activity of the relevant gene(s). DNA methylation at CpG islands involve attachment of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of the cytosine residue to make a 5-methyl cytosine. CpG islands are normally protected from methylation, however when they are methylated they are associated with gene silencing.</p>
<p>Through cancer progression from normal tissue to metastatis we note an increase in the level of methylation at CpG islands. This is referred to as CpG island hypermethylation. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are silenced by CpG island hypermethylation. The specific pattern of hypermethylation is individual to each cancer type, but CpG island hypermethylation is found in most tumor types.</p>
<p>Gene silencing can affect single genes or sets of genes. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as those involved in DNA repair, means that DNA methylation suppresses the organisms defence against cancerous cells and allow abnormal cells to survive and multiply. Further, since methylation is mitotically heritable, DNA methylation is an effective locking down mechanism for gene silencing.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and non-coding repetitive elements are normally methylated to ensure silencing and genomic stability. This is to prevent genomic instability such as illegimitate recombination, inappropriate activation of repeats, transposons or cryptic promotors, and to prevent disruption to proximal genes.</p>
<p>In cancer we note genome-wide hypomethylation. Therefore the protective methylation of intergenic regions and repeats is removed.  Hypomethylation is most commonly found at repeats, so the disruption of DNA methylation can therefore lead to genomic instability as noted above. Genomic instability is caracteristic of many cancers and DNA hypomethylation is therefore a key contributor to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting refers to the monoallelic expression of a gene in a parent-of-origin derterminated fashion. Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) control expression of imprinted genes. The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, i.e. the paternal ICR is methylated. This prevents binding of CTCF insulator protein and the Igf2 gene is exposed to the effect of the downstream enhancers. In addition the methylation spreads to the H19 gene promotor. In effect the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated. This leads to binding of CTCF. Igf2 is insulated from the downstream enhancers, thereby silenced and H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor, hypermethylation of the maternal ICR leads to loss of imprinting and prevents CTCF from binding. In effect both alleles behave like the paternal allele, as both express the growth promoting Igf2 whereas H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>The loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of Igf2, which is growth promoting and thus predisposes the individual to childhood tumors. In addition to tumorgenesis, loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is also found in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome which is associated with fetal overgrowth and childhood cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (diseases of the bone marrow) and trades under the name Dacogen. DNMTis irreversibly bind to DNA methyltransferases to inhibit their methylating action. It is therefore also referred to as a demethylation or hypomethylation agent. The intention is to restore the normal funtion of tumor suppressor genes by demethylating them and thereby activating them.</p>
<p>Decitabine is replication dependent in that is is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into DNA and thereafter block DNMT action. Replication dependency means that the drug has a greater effect on the rapidly replicating cancer cells.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor effect of Decitabine is twofold. By activating tumor suppressor genes the body's own defence system is activated, in addition the covalent adducts between DNA methyltransfereace and DNA incorporated decitabine is thought to be toxic to proliferating cells (additional source: dacogen.com)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes, such as altering DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable and thereby passed on in the cell line. This is sometimes referred to as maintenance methylation. Drugs that alter the DNA methylation state of the genome will therefore alter the epigenetic state of all the cells decending from the changed cell. Mitotic heritability is one of the key determinants for a marker or a change to be considered epigenetic.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs can potentially affect every cell in the body. These drugs are therefore not normally administrated to patients during sensitive periods or to patients who are pregnant. Sensitive periods can be defined as periods where the epigenome is reprogrammed. Epigenomic markers are cleared and thereafter re-established.</p>
<p>There are two main phases of epigenetic reprogramming; the early development period (for a fertilized egg and embryo) and primordial germ cell development. Young patients who are still developing their germ cells are in a sensitive period, and pregnant women in the very early stages of pregnancy carry embryos undergoing imprinting reprogramming. Since we do not fully know the effects of epigenetic drugs on germ cells, treating these patiens with such drugs would be inadvisable.</p></div>
