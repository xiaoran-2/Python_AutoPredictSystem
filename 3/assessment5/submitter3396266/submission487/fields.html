    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (methylation at a Cytosine-Guanine dinucleotide) is an epigenetic mechanism that suppresses the expression of genes or promoters (regions of DNA where transcription machinery binds). <br /><br />The CpG islands are located at the promoters (start) of genes, in Normal Cells these regions are generally hypomethylated allowing the expression of the genes necessary for the cell functions and several tumour-supressor genes. Normally, Intergenic Regions and Repetitive elements (regions of DNA that are able to copy themselves and move into another part of the genome) are methylated maintaining genomic integrity by compacting the chromatin structure of these regions, preventing illegitimate recombination of Repeats and protecting the activation of promoters which could interfere with the transcription of normal genes.<br /><br />In contrast Cancer cells exhibit hypermethylation at CpG islands thus silencing the expression of tumour-supressor genes that normally repair and prevent genomic mutations (e.g., RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT) and also inhibiting the synthesis of proteins needed by some Chemotherapy agents to reach an active form (e.g. Temozolomide).</p>
<p>All Cancer cells experience Genome-wide hypomethylation to some degree, this leads to Genomic Instability by many means like disruption to neighboring genes by cryptic promoters present in both intergenic regions and Repeats, by changing the chromatin structure of these regions into open euchromatin allowing illegitimate recombination, and in the case of Repeats allowing their transposition into other parts of the genome furthering their mutagenic capabilities which should be normally suppressed by methylation.<br /><br />These epimutations often are more frequent than mutations, and give the neoplastic cells a competitive advantage over other normal cells and as these changes are mitotically heritable these changes further progress with tumorigenicity and help the evolution and dissemination of the Cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, meaning that the imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele this allows the binding of the insulator protein CTCF in the maternal ICR insulating the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers allowing these to instead act on H19 enhancing it's expression. On the paternal allele CTCF is unable to bind to the methylated ICR allowing the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression while the paternal H19 gene is silenced because of DNA methylation spreading from the ICR to the H19 promoter. This results in imprinted expression of the paternal Igf2 and the maternal H19 genes.<br /><br />A common feature in cancer cells is the loss of imprinting, in the case of Wilm's tumour this occurs by hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 ICR, preventing CTCF binding the maternal ICR resulting in the expression of both Igf2 genes, this hypermethylation spreads to the H19 gene promoters in both alleles silencing it's expression.</p>
<p>The result is an overdose of Igf2 with it's growth promoting properties and an absence of the long noncoding RNA normally produced by H19 which is necessary for the regulation of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase at low doses. And it causes direct cytotoxicity at high doses in abnormal hematopoietic cells.<br /><br />Hypermethylation in tumour cells silences several tumour-suppressor genes, thus Decitabine can help to restore the expression of these genes allowing to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenomic change, so once disrupted by cancer or corrected by epigenomic drugs it's effects will last on the daughter cells until actively changed by another methylation agents.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time in development when altered enviroments can have an effect on epigenetic control , such as the period from primordial germ cells development until the production of mature gametes and the period from pre-implantation and early post-implantation  of the embryo</p>
<p>As genome-wide hypomethylation leads to Genomic Instability by changing the chromatin structure to a more open and active form allowing illegitimate recombinations and transpositions in the genome, treating a patient with demethylating agents during a sensitive period allows changes in the enviroment such as diet or chemical exposure to have a greater potential to induce a variety of modifications in the genome of the patient or in the patient's descendance if the developing gametes are affected in the sensitive period.</p></div>
