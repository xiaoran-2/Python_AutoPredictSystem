    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of imprinted genes is controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). ICR methylation is established in primordial germ cells to achieve mono allelic parent-of-origin specific gene expression. Many imprinted genes are involved in either growth promotion of suppression. Alterations in the methylation of ICRs can result in cancer either by silencing tumour suppressor genes or by over expressing growth promoting genes. In the case of Wilm’s tumour patients, the problem is caused by hypermethylation of the ICRs in the H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes leading to overexpression of the oncogene Igf2.</p>
<p>Normally, the maternal ICR of this cluster is unmethylated, allowing it to bind to the insulator protein CTCF. Igf2 is silenced as it cannot be accessed by downstream enhancers. H19 is instead activated by these distal enhancers. In contrast, the paternal ICR is methylated which blocks CTCF from binding to it. Consequently, methylation spreads to H19 causing it to be silenced. Downstream enhancers are free to access Igf2 which results in its expression. In Wilm’s tumour patients, the maternal ICR incorrectly exhibits methylation. This results in both parental alleles expressing the growth promoter Igf2, instead of just the paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs known as DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors (DNMTi). These drugs cause DNA hypomethylation by inhibiting methylation of newly synthesised DNA. They are dependent on cell division as they operate by irreversibly binding to DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) after being incorporated into the DNA. DNA methylation is established and maintained by DNMTs.  For example, DNMT1 is responsible for maintaining methylation patterns during cell replication. Decitabine inhibits methyltransferases so no new methylation marks can be laid down as cells replicate. DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable so this drug is in fact altering the epigenome. </p>
<p>Since cancer cells replicate rapidly, these drugs have a greater effect on cancerous cells. In order to work the dosage has to be carefully monitored. At very low dosages these drugs have an anti-neoplastic effect as they result in DNA demethylation. The drug is most effective on myelodysplastic syndrome, possibly due to the high levels of CpG island methylation in this disease.</p></div>

In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>About half of human genes have their promoters surrounded by CpG islands. In healthy cells, the cytosine of these CpG sites don't usually exhibit DNA methylation. They are hypomethylated. Since there is no methylation, they exhibit an open chromatin structure and allow for easier expression of nearby genes. They are also less susceptible to mutations. [1]</p>
<p>In cancerous cells, there is more likely to be hypermethylation of promoter associated CpG islands. The level of methylation progresses with time and is highest in metastic tissue. This hypermethylation extends to the CpG island shores, about 2 kilobases either side of the island. There are even sets of CpG islands exhibiting hypermethylation (CIMPs). The hypermethylation of CpG islands results in a tightly packed chromatin structure and silencing of nearby genes. As these CpG islands often contain the promoters of tumour supressing genes, CpG island hypermethylation is often present in tumours. This is due partly to the fact that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so if these CpG islands contain the promoters of tumour suppressor genes they can be epigenetically silenced leading to the formation of tumours.</p>
<p>The majority of the genome is made up of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In healthy cells, these are usually methylated as they need to be silenced. DNA methylation at these regions maintains genomic stability and the tightly packed chromatin structure prevents illegitimate recombinations from occurring. In cancerous cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements exhibit hypomethylation. The hypomethylation progresses with time and methylation levels are lowest in metastic tissue. This hypomethylation is most common in the repetitive elements. The loss of methylation in these regions leads to increased genomic instability due to the loosely packaged chromatin. There can be loss/insertion of chromosomes, illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes/repeats, the repeats can be activated and transpose to other regions of the gene or cryptic promoters can be activated in the repeats which lead to disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. DNMT inhibitor drugs affect the epigenome even after drug treatment has ceased, as alterations made to DNA methylation levels will continue to be passed on to successive generations of cells. While hypomethylation resulting from DNMT inhibitors may benefit an elderly sufferer of myelodysplastic syndrome, these drugs are not selective for cancer cells and their long term effect on healthy cells is unknown. While hypermethylation at CpG islands is indicative of tumour growth, DNA methylation is also crucial for cell viability and its removal from all cells would be detrimental. Patients receiving these drugs could experience side effects due to hypomethylation of healthy cells. However, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance also needs to be considered.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks are important for regulating gene expression and determining an individual's phenotypes. The epigenome undergoes two sensitive periods of reprogramming where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. These occur during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. However epigenetic clearing can sometimes be incomplete at certain loci suggesting that environmental events in one generation can be transgenerationally inherited via the gametes. These drugs should be avoided during periods of germ cell development as patients could pass on altered DNA methylation marks to subsequent generations via the germ line. A periconceptual or pregnant female could potentially affect two subsequent generations.</p></div>
