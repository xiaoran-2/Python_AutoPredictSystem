    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* In a normal cell we don't see methylation at a CpG island (hypomethylation)</p>
<p>* In a cancer cell the CpG islands are methylated (hypermethylation). The identity of the specific methylated CGIs varies by tumor type. The CGI methylation progresses with time.</p>
<p>* The methylation of the CpG islands in a cancerours cell silences the tumor suppression genes and is one of the "hits" neccessary for tumorigenesis</p>
<p>* In a normal cell, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated to maintain genomic stability</p>
<p>* In a cancer cell, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are not longer methylated (hypomethylation). This also progresses in time.</p>
<p>* The hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions can cause Illegitimate recombination between repeats, Activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and distruption to neighbouring genes - all causing deletions, insertions and translocations of genes (Genomic instability)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* In a normal cell the imprinted control region of paternal allele is methylated so the enhancers act on the Igf2 gene causing it's expression.</p>
<p>* In a normal cell the imprinted control region of maternal allele is not methylated so the enhancers act on the H19 gene cauing it's expression, and the expression of the Igf2 gene is silences.</p>
<p>* In wilm's tumor we have hyper methylation of the imprinted control region of the maternal allele causing also an expression of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>* Since the Igf2 gene is expressed in both the paternal and the maternal allele it results in a double dosage of the Igf2 gene in comparison to a normal cell. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter it contributes to the generation of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* Decitabine belong to the class of DNMTi (<span>DNA methyltransferase</span> inhibitors)</p>
<p>* Decibine is a nucleoside analogue that get incorperated into the DNA upon replication and bind DNMTs, </p>
<p>* Since Decibine depends on replication, they mostly target tumor cells and not regular cells. They bind to DNMTS and in very small dosage they cause DNA demethylation which has an anti-neoplastic effect  in <span>myelodysplastic syndromes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>* DNA methylation is mitotically inherited by the daughter cells so in tumors, since they are constantly replicating, the drug effects on the DNA methylation is sustained in the daugter cells even after the period of drug treatment</p>
<p>* Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming where the epigenetic marks are cleared and reestablished. </p>
<p>* The sensitive periods are in the pre impantation early development, and in the premordial germ cell development</p>
<p>* Since in the sensitive periods the epigenetic marks are cleared and reestablished using drugs that alter DNA methylation in these periods can have significant implication on the normal cells. (they can cause hyper or hypo methylation of the normal cells causing a lasting and global defect on all the cells of the body)</p></div>
