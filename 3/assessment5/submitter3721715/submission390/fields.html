    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue, CpG islands (CGIs) occur predominantly in promoter regions of genes and generally are unmethylated regions, thus gene transcription occurs.  In cancer or disease, abnormal methylation occurring at promoter regions preventing gene expression can contribute to carcinogenesis/disease by silencing the expression of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) or genes regulating cell cycling.  Loss of TSG function promotes uncontrolled cellular proliferation by deregulation of cell cycling thus leading to cancer.  For example, loss of BRCA1 predisposes patients to breast cancer.  Disruption of normal cell cycling or gene function can lead to disease (overexpression or underexpression of critical genes).  For example, excess production of Igf2 leads to overgrowth and impaired glucose control when methylation is lost in imprinted disorders.</p>
<p>Normally DNA methylation occurring at intergenic regions/repetitive elements is vital for maintaining chromosomal stability by silencing their expression due to these regions being capable of generating new genes.  This occurs due to abnormal coupling with similar long sequences of DNA during replication (causing replication errors) or if a transposable element, by being capable of inserting themselves in other regions (even on other chromosomes) and by having strong promoters that can aberrantly promote the expression of neighbouring genes.  These factors, believed to arise from evolutionary benefit, can contribute to carcinogenesis by causing intra/interchromosomal instability by inserting themselves into other regions, or by promoting neighbouring genes that may be oncogenic (promote cellular proliferation) or by translocations causing coupling with products that deregulate cell cycling.  Thus, when normal methylation of these repetitive elements is lost in cancer/disease, abnormal expression of this usually silent region occurs which results in the following -  abnormal expression of genes that are usually not expressed, aberrant replication (replication errors), chromosomal instability or the generation of new genes with oncogenic or disease promoting function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, whereby the paternal gene is silenced and the maternal allele is expressed.  For the paternal allele,  CTCF (an insulator protein) binds at the imprint control region (ICR) which is methylated.  Methylation extends to the H19 promoters, silencing it by conferring a change to the chromatin looping such that the downstream enhancers do not promote H19 expression but Igf2 which is upstream of CTCF binding site.  On the maternal allele absence of methylation at the ICR results in a chromatin structure that favours the enhancers promoting expression of H19 instead of Igf2, thus Igf2 expression is silenced/insulated. Wilm’s tumours, occurs in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome which affects both the Kcnq1 cluster and H19/Igf2 cluster.  In this disease, both paternal alleles are abnormally expressed. The maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele thus biallelic expression of Igf2 occurs simulataneously with loss of maternal Cdkn1c (tumour suppressor gene) from the Kcnq1 cluster, combining to promote tumour formation by the favouring growth promotion through Igf2 overexpression and loss of tumour suppressor function of cdkn1c.  Disruption to these imprinted clusters can occur by mutation/deletion/uniparental disomy (expression of only  paternal allele), or epigenetic disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), are nucleoside analogues and are Incorporated during DNA replication and irreversibly bind to DNMT.  The exact mechanism is unclear in how it works to cause hypomethylation/demethylation in disease as effects are not cell specific and may have other unknown effects such as immunomodulation/inflammation (suggested by Stephen Baylin’s study where PDL-1 worked in combination for lung cancer). In myelodysplastic disorders, DNMTi are thought to reduce methylation as hypermethylation is known to be a poor prognostic factor In myelodysplastic/proliferative disorders. Thus, demethylating agents like decitabine may help treat myeloplastic disorders by reversing abnormal gene silencing due to hypermethylation of critical genes (which include possibly tumour suppressor genes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring epigenomic effects as these changes are heritable. The sensitive period refers to two periods during primordial germ cell development and the early embryonic/post implantation period where epigenetic marks undergo resetting/reprogramming and can be sensitive to disruption/loss/change.  Use of epigenetic modifiers during sensitive periods can impact any cell type (cancer and normal) and can cause disease as a result of disrupting critical epigenetic factors deregulating normal cell control or function.   For example, fetal development in the patient or in subsequent generations due to transgenerational effects with maintainence of these epigenetic marks, can be heritable.  Thus future generations may inherit epigenetic dysfunction.  Thus avoiding drugs in pregnancy and children and younger patients or when germ cells are sensitive would be advisable.    </p></div>
