    <h1>Submission 1569 from Anon (session_user_id: 95944f2020995ffe7a04c1682bb0763c470d41fd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents also known as DNA-Methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It is FDA approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). As Decitabine inhibits DNMTs, this means it inhibits the DNA methylation. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. In other words activation of tumors suppressor genes inhibits the uncontrolled division of tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs like those that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last for generations. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Considering the long lasting effects, those drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods. Pre-implantation period of the early development and germ cell development are considered as sensitive periods and are the time periods were the epigenome is maintained. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found in the promoter region of genes. DNA methylation of those islands is an inhibitory mark for that specific gene. Tumor suppressor genes that are important for appropriate cell growth have unmethylated CpG islands in their promoters of normal cells. Tumor cells show DNA methylation in the CpG island of those tumor suppressor genes and as a consequence there is an uncontrolled cell division. CpG island methylation happens more often than mutations and is also used as biomarker for specific diseases. In contrast, DNA methylation in intergenic regions is usually more present in genes of normal cells but absent in genes of tumor cells. Lots of genes in mammals have repetitive elements that are potential sites for unwanted translocations between different chromosomes. DNA methylation of those sites serves as an inhibitory mechanism for aberrant translocations und thus, disease prevention. Many cancer types are a consequence of aberrant chromosomal translocations that produce fusion oncoproteins caused from unmethylated itergenic repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disrupted imprinting can contribute to cancer e.g. Wilm's tumour and the H19/Igf2 cluster in the short arm of chromosome 11.</span></p>
<p><span>- In normal situation DNA methylation of paternal Imprinting control region (ICR) but not maternal ICR allows the heterozygous expression of Igf2.  Paternal ICR is hypermethylated which inhibits the binding of CTCF protein in ICR and activation of H19 gene. This leads to the activation and expression of Igf2 gene. Maternal ICR is hypomethylated and allows binding of CTCF to ICR to activate H19 gene and inhibit the enhancers for Igf2 gene activation.</span></p>
<p><span>- In Wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal ICR are hypermethylated. In this case there is a homozygous expression of Igf2 gene. IGF-2 is a growth promoting hormone and more of it can cause abnormal growth.</span></p></div>
