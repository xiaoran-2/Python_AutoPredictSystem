    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. Exceptions are CpG islands. CpG is a dinucleotide in one strand of DNA. Here C and G are adjacent nucleotides separated by a phosphate bridge. <br />Many genes in a mammal genomes have CpG islands associated with the start of the gene known as promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. <br />However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.<br /><br />An intergenic region is a stretch of DNA sequences located between genes. Intergenic regions are a subset of noncoding DNA. Occasionally some intergenic DNA acts to control genes nearby, but most of it has no currently known function.<em> Inter</em>genic regions are different from <em>intra</em>genic regions (or introns). <br />Repetitive elements, or repeats, are patterns of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. <br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elemns are usually methylated. DNA methylation of intergeneic regions lead to kind of silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Regarding repetitive elemts, DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity. It is used to silence repeats, to prevent transpositions and to avoid transcriptional intrference from strong promotors. Also the methylation of repeats may prevents illegitimate recombination.<br />In cancer, there is a lack of methylation on intergenic regions and repetitive elements which causes a so-called hypomethylation.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting describes the modifcation of a gene, or a chromosome region by the parental gonad such that only one allele of the gene is expressed. IGF2 and H19 are two imprinted genes located adjacent to each other a region which is frequently involved in cancer. In the case of IGF2 gene, only the paternally inherited allele is expressed while the maternal allele is silent. The H19 gene is oppositely imprinted and is expressed from only the maternal allele.<br />In diseases such as Wilm’s tumor the imprinting of IGF2 is relaxed, the normally silent maternal allele becomes active and the gene is biallelically expressed, so Wilm's tumour is associated with overexpression of Igf2. ICR is unmethylated in maternal allele. This unmethylated ICR is bound by CTCF protein which is a insulator protein, insulating lgf2 from downstream enhancers by restricting enhancer access to IGF2. These enhancers act on H19 increasing the expression of H19 allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is sold as Dacogen by Eisai (a Japanese company) It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />Decitabine, which is chemically a cytidine alaog, is a hypomethylation agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA-Methyltransferase.</p>
<p>It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine which is also mentioned in the article, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains.<br />DNA methyltransferase-inhibiting nucleoside analogs, such as Decitabine, reactivate the expression of tumor suppressor genes and apoptosis-related genes silenced by methylation, thus favoring the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. Moreover, induction of DNA damage seems to contribute to their antitumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is the period of development when the environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the animal, due to that the epigenome is actively remodeled, such as the removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks. <br />They include the primordial germ cell development through mature eggs or sperm and the preimplantation and postimplantation periods. <br /><br />When an undifferentiated cell becomes committed to a particular cell type, methylation is used to silence the genes that are not needed, by using DNA methylation. Methylation ensures that a cell is  uniquely defined and causes the expression of the genes needed. This is why methylation is important to cell differentiation. By altering the DNA Methylation, the differentiation of the cells might be changed.<br />So it is obvious, that treating patients during sensitive periods may alter the differentiation process of developing cells, which might not only have effects on the patient himself, but as well on further generations.</p></div>
