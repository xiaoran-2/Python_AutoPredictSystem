    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation at CPG islands is the addition of a methyl group in which gene expression is silenced at these particular islands. In certain cancers, CpG islands exhibit hypermethylation. Usually, CpG islands are unmethylated and so with the abnormality of hypermethylation, this is indicative of cancer. As a result, hypermethylation increases with tumorigenicity. With excessive hypermethylation, genes controling tumor suppressors are silenced thus leading to continued tumor growth.  Without reestablishing the regular methylation in the body, tumor suppressors continue to be repressed and tumors continue to be produced. The role of DNA Methylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions is maintain genomic integrity in both the repetitive elements and intergenic regions.  Specifically, in the intergenic regions, methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic slice sites. In the repetitive elements, methylation silences repeats to prevent transposition, silences mutations of repeats to prevent transposition, silences repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. Cancer disrupts DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements through causing genome wide hypomethylation. Usually, these areas are methylated yet, cancer causes hypomethylation, an abnormality correlating with a lower about of methylation than usual. This, like hypermethylation, correlates with increased tumorigenicity.  Overall, there is genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats (they can't be packaged down), activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.  Hypomethylation contributes to disease by enhancing tumorigenesis, driven by chromosomal instability.  With a lack of stability, the genome is vulnerable to the growth of malicious tumors which can, if not treated appropriately or with bad luck can result in death.  Cancer affects DNA methylation on both ends of the spectrum which both contribute to the survival of cancer. In sum, DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands silences tumor suppressors which lead to tumorigenesis and DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, contributing to tumorigenicity. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA Methylation at ICRs (hypo or hyper), can result in a loss of expression in growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. In a normal cell, the maternal side has an unmethylated H19 and IgF2 isn't expressed (silent) because of the fact that there isn't further methylation downstream and that the enhancers are acting on H19. Additionally the ICR in this region is expressed thus there isn't any Igf2 expression.. . Paternally, IgF2 is expressed and downstream, the H19 is methylated thus due to this downstream methylation, we know that IgF2 is being expressed. Paternally, the enhancers are acting on the Igf2 and the ICR in this region is methylated as well. In Wilm's Tumor, H19/IgF2 is disrupted because on the maternal side, Igf2 becomes active and thus H19 gets methylated. The person receives two doses of Igf2 rather than the normal one dose and because Igf2 is growth promoting, it is logical that a tumor should result if one receives twice the normal amount. This extra methylation contributes to Wilm's Tumor because twice the normal amount leads to extra growth due to extra dosage of Igf2 which wouldn't normally happen in healthy cells which only exhibit one dosage. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the methyltransferase class of inhibitors. Its impact on DNA methylation is that it inhibits DNA methyltransferase and by doing so it hypomethylates DNA. Due to Decitabines ability to de-methylate DNA, its able to remove the hypermethylation on tumor suppressors. Hypermethylated tumor suppressors would have allowed tumors to growth because the suppressors would have been silent from the hypermethylation.  Thus, by using Decitabine, it "unmethylated" the tumor suppressors and consequently slows and inevitably stops tumor growth but, allowing expression of tumor suppressors.  Suppressors are sort of "brought back into the fight" in that Decitabine takes away the methylation, allowing the suppressors to inhibit growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome in numerous ways. If we were to use inhibitors of DNA Methylation such that there is hypomethylation, this could create problems because hypomethylation of the DNA leads to genomic instability. Yet, hypermethylating to counter act hypomethylation may lead to certain genes that would get silenced when they shouldn't be silenced like tumor suppressors.  It is much like a balancing act because we can't have too much or too little otherwise problems may arise.  Genomic instability can lead to many human disease mutations like ICF Syndrome. Sensitive periods can be defined as periods in the development of a human where there is the active removal and laying down of epigenetic marks.  Environmental factors and other factors tend to have a larger effect on the epigenetics during these regions which can influence transgenerational inheritance of offspring.  The sensitive periods of development are pre-implantation to post-implantation and during primordial germ cell development to the development of gametes and eggs.  Treating these patients during sensitive periods may alter their epigenetic makeup in a negative way.  Negative manipulations epigenetically are transgenerational and will effect future offspring. By not treating patients during these times, it will prevent further possible health problems late down the road for future offspring.</p></div>
