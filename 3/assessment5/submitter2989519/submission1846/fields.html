    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation is necessary for life itself. By placing methyl-groups on certain cytosine molecules in the DNA, the cells can be told what to do at which times in the development and life of the organism.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The whole working of the cell though is changed, as soon as cancer happens. The patterns of DNA methylation will change in a complex way. In cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated, while the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">These hypermethylations happens often in promotor-associated CpG islands, silencing affected genes permanently. And with this silencing it can cause several diseases, not just cancers.</p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the case of cancer, these can be both inherited or aquired later in life. If inherited, the methylation was already programmed during the sensitive periods of development. The pre-implantation period and during the making of the primordial germ cells. If inherited the newly programmed methylations is mitotically transmitted to every somatic cell in the organism and meiotically to the primordial germ cells during their development. </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">If aquired later in life, you have to think of any other way mutations can happen. But these epigentic changes in methylation are also mitotically inherited, but only in the somatic cells derived from the original damaged one.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Decitabine is a new DNA-demethylating agent, and a so called epigenetic drug. And is apparently working through demethylisation of the DNA, therefore reversing the silencing of genes by demethylating the CpG islands that are promotor-associated.</span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Decitabine can slow tumor growth, certainly when used with a new histone-deacetylase inhibitor. Giving as a side-effect that the same patients unnexpectedly got more sensitive to routine chemo-therapy.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Epigenetic drugs can have a lasting effect, because they effectively reverse the methylation and therefore the silencing or expressing of genes involved with the tumor.</span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">They should however never be used in the sensitive periods of foetal development. These are the pre-implantation period, when the embryonic stem cells are active in the inner cell mass and the period in which the promordial germ cells will be made. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Like all medications, they reach every place in the body and can have effect on every cell, including the germ cells. Decitabine can also reach an developing foetus, where it will disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming of both the maternal and paternal genome.  </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">It would even be a better advise if both male and female put any plans for children and pregnancies on hold for the duration of the treatment with these new epigenetic drugs.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Disrupted imprinting can have several causes, but we will take Wilm's Tumor as an example. Wilm's tumor is a kidney cancer that is most seen in children under 5 years of age, with a paternal cause. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Wilm's tumor depends on the linked <em>Igf2/H19</em>-cluster and <em>Kcnq1</em>-cluster. <em>Igf2</em> is an oncogene which can be silenced by methylation of the <em>Kcnq1</em>-cluster. This normally happens on the maternal allele.</span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">But in some cases of Wilm's tumor we see that the maternal allele behaves as if it was paternal. This can only be caused by having two copies of one parental chromosome. In these cases it is the paternal chromosome who deliverd two copies, creating an uniparental disomy (UPD). </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">On a normal maternal allele the <em>Igf2/H19</em> cluster is unmethylated, but <em>Kcnq1</em>-cluster is methylated, therefore <em>Igf2/H19</em> is silenced and we have no extra growth. In case of the paternal UPD <em>Ifg2/H19</em> will be methylated, allowing <em>Kcnq1</em>-cluster to upregulate <em>Ifg2/H19</em> and creating an overdose of <em>Igf2/H19</em>. </span></span></p></div>
