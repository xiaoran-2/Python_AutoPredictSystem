    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells exibit both hypermethylation and hypomethylation in different regions of the genome. In non normally cells CpG islands are protected from methylation. CpG islands are rare in genes, but common is gene promoter regions. Methylations in a gene promoter region causes expression of the gene to be suppressed. In cancer cell CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, suppressing tumor suppressor genes. CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, but tend to be unmethylated in cancer cells. The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to genetic stability. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements reduces genetic stability and can activate genes with CpG poor promoters including proto-oncogenes and MicroRNAs that target tumor suppressors. Cancer cells also exhibit hypermethylation in imprint control regions. Many of the imprinted genes are involved in grows, change the balanced of  the  expression of imprinted genes frequently causes tumors.. This hypermethylation of CpG islands and ICRs accompanied by hypomethylation elsewhere may be part of the normal aging process; it can also be caused by genetic mutation in genes that control methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 / Ifg2 cluster, which includes the Igf2 gene, a CTCF biding site, the H19 gene and downstream enhancers,, is located on Chromosome 11. Normally the CTCF binding site and the H19 gene are imprinted on the paternal chromosome. When CTCF binds to the binding site it isolates the Igf2 gene from the down stream enhancers, causing these enhances to act on the H19 gene isolated. Tus the maternal, unimprinted chromosome expressed H19, but not Igf2. On the paternal chromosome the CTCF binding site is methylates, so it can not be bound to, this allows the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2. The methylation on the H19 gene suppresses its expression on the paternal chromosome. So the paternal allele of Igf2 is express, but not the paternal allele of H19. If for some reason the maternal chromosome is methylated then CTCF will not bind and Igf2<span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Times;"> will be express from both chromosomes. Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) is a proto-oncogene and excessive expression causes </span></span><span><span>Wilm’s tumour  in the kidneys of children who have imprinting on both chromosomes.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;color:#4a4a4a;">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent this means that it remove methylation from DNA causing the DNA to become hypomethylated. Cancer cell generally are hypermethylated in CpG islands, demethylating these CpG islands would undo this and most likely reduce expression of many oncogenes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning methyalation is inherited by both daughter cells when a cell reproduces, so alteration of DNA methylation will persist unless it is removed. Sensitive periods are the periods when genes are epigeneticly reprogrammed, methylation is removed and added. Sensitive periods are during gamete formation and early embryonic development. Since methylation is being changes in germ line cells during sensitive periods it is likely that exposure to epigenetic drugs during these periods would have considerable effect on offspring. Possible problems could include improper imprinting of improper X chromosome deactivation, each of which could result in improper levels of gene expression.</p></div>
