    <div class="field-value"><p>Cpg islands are regions in our genome are regions with a high amount of CG dinucleotides which in normal tissue tend to be hypomethylated. This normally allows a normal function of a gene. In cancer for example, CpG islands tend to me rather hypermethylated, which has the effect of silencing of a certain gene. When we talk about cancer-epigenetics, this process has its relevance when the silenced gene is actually a tumour suppressor gene, which normally functions in healthy cells. Silencing of these genes leads to unregulated growth and therefore to abnormal cells. Studies have shown genes that are hypermethylated in some forms of cancer: MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT. This information can be used to predict the prognosis of some cancer forms: hypermethylation of MLH1 in colorectal cancer is asociated with a good prognosis.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions have also shown relevant modifiation in cancer. These regions are normally methylated and provide genome stabiliy. If they are altered, they tend to be rather hypomethylated. As a result, DNA is more loose-this contributing to an increase in genome instability. This instability of the chromatin is then susceptible to changes like transpositions, insertions, deletions which can cause mutation and aberrant transcription of genes. Transpositions are actually an exchange of genetic material between chromosomes, which can lead to inactivation of activation of normally active or inactive genes and therefore to celular protein modifications. Deletions lead to loss of genetic material and therefore aberrant transcription or complete loss of function and insertions can either activate or deactivate other genes and lead to either gain or loss of function. Also hypomethylation of the repetitive elemets can lead to activation of these repeats, which can then activate cryptic promotors, that are normally inactive.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a relevant example of Loss Of Imprinting through hypermethylation in epigenetics.</p>
<p>Normally we have 2 alleles with the same DNA sequence but they are not equally regulated. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated at the ICR which allows binding of CTCF to that region. As a result the enhancers which are located downstream of this locus can only act on the H19 gene which is also downstrean. CTCF binding blocks the acces of the enhancers to the Igf2 gene which remains silent. In case of the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, therefore CTCF will no longer bind, which allows enhancers to access the Igf2 gene which is upstrea from that locus. As a result Igf2 is transcribed on the paternal allele. </p>
<p>In the case of wilms tumour both alleles are methylated at the ICR, as if the person would have 2 copies of the paternal allele or the maternal copy has been modified to work like the paternal allele. This leads to high transcription of the Igf2-gene. Igf (Insulin-like Growth factor) in high amounts leads to abnormal cellular growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a new drug used in MDS. It belongs to the enzymatic epigenetic regulators, more precise it is a DNMT inhibitor. This substance is a nucleoside-analogon which will irreversibly bind to a DNA-methyl-transferase (DNMT) after it is incorporated into the DNA. Inhibiting DNMT had the result of reducing DNA methylation. Irreversible binding refers to the fact that these DNMTs that are targeted will no longer function, so the only way to regain DNA-methylation is by producing new DNMTs.</p>
<p>Decitabine was also used in the 1980s but in doses which were toxic and without benefcial effecte. The anti-neoplastic effect takes places at very small doses of the drug, but the exact mechanism of action (besides reducing DNA methylation) is yet to be discovered. The effects are stunning in cases of MDS where normal chemotherapy failed to work.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. This process is maybe the most relevant process in the entire epigenetics and regulated almost the entire gene-expression. A gene with a methylated promoter will lead to gene silencing, and a gene with an unmethylated promotor will be active. Normally epigenetic marks are reversible and that is why they are a valuable source of new drugs for cancer therapy.  The problem is here are certain periods of time where these marks are modified or erased, so therapy should only pe applied at ceratin periods of time, which makes this new opportunity rather sensitive, because these marks are very delicate and are hard to be controlled.</p>
<p>We know the sensitive periods are actually moments in our development which are under epigenetic modification of the genome. Altering these sensitive periods can dramatically hurt normal cell development. We know that all epigenetic marks are erased at the formation of the zygote. Then we suffer epigenetic modifications during early embryonic developement and stem cell developement. In these periods the genes are unmethylated for a short period of time and after that immediately methylated back. This process is crucial for pluripotent cell building and differentiation in all the tissues that are to be found in the human body.</p>
