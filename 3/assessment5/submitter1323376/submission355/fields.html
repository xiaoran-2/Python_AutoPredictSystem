    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the bonding of a methyl molecule to the 5' carbon of a cytosine-guanine dinucleotide.  DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing. Typically, in normal cells, CpG islands are unmethylated and the associated genes are expressed. The CpG islands are portions of DNA that have high concentration of CpG dinucleotides. They are related to gene promoters and consequently expression of the gene is affected by the methylation or non methylation of the CpG nucleotides.</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG dinucleotide suppresses gene expression either by binding to proteins that suppress transcription, MeCP proteins, or by blocking the binding of transcription factors. CpG methylation is actually mutagenic, tending to turn methylated cytosine into the other pyrimidine base, thymine.</p>
<p>Typically the CpG islands are unmethylated, allowing the gene to be expressed. Methylation would prevent gene expression, so DNA methylation has a benefit that overcomes the disadvantage of being a mutagent. The benefit could be its ability to silence expression of undesirable repetitive elements and intergenic DNA regions. Additionally, DNA methylation is useful in silencing of genes in facultative and constitutive chromatin at times when it is healthful for those genes to be silenced.</p>
<p>At CpG islands DNA is unmethylated to allow gene expression, but in many cases it is desirable to silence a gene. In these cases the CpG island promoters are methylated, resulting in gene silencing.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic DNA regions and repetitive elements are disruptive when expressed, causing genomic instability, disease and cancer. Disruption occurs from from undesiable recombination, translocation, or upstream genetic expression. DNA methylation is used to silence these regions which might cause genomic instability </p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated, silencing desirable expression, and CpG sites around intergenic regions and in repetitive elements become hypomethylated, promoting undesirable expression and creating genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are often associated with growth and development functions. The effect of imprinting can either silence or increase gene expression, depending on the epigenetic control mechanism.  With H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinted paternal methylation pattern produces growth enhancement. The maternal allele is unmethylated in the ICR, which silences the growth enhancement.</p>
<p>Related to the growth enhancement of the Igf2 gene is the growth suppression of the Kcnq cluster. Both are results of parent of origin imprinting.</p>
<p>The effect of the paternal imprinting is to prevent binding of the CTCF insulator protein. The CTCF protein can bind at the maternal unmethylated ICR. This protein affects whether upstream enhancer genes activate the Igf2 gene (paternal) or the H19 gene (maternal).</p>
<p>The unmethylated materal allele allows the binded CTCF insulator to block expression of the Igf2 growth promoter gene. The paternal allele is imprinted at the ICR and the prevents CTCF binding, allowing the enhancers to activate the Igf2 growth promoters.</p>
<p>If the materal allele acts like the paternal allele, and has methylation at the ICR the result is overexpression of Igf2. This results in Beckwith Weidemann Syndrome. It also is associated with Wilm's Tumor, a kidney cancer in youths. The overexpression of Igf2 encourages the tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Several cancer drugs are being developed that are designed to correct genetic regulation. Decitabine is one of these epigenetic cancer drugs. Specifically Decitabine is a demethylating agent that works directly on DNA.  Methylation on DNA acts typically on promoter regions to silence gene expression. When promoters are hypermethylated then gene expression is reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p>In the case of growth inhibitor genes that in many cases act as cancer tumor growth suppressors, this DNA methylation aids cancer growth by restricting the expression of growth inhibitor proteins.</p>
<p>Decitabine removes the DNA methylation, thereby enabling the tumor suppression genes to be expressed. This tumor suppression is then able to inhibit the growth of the cancer tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the promising aspects of epigenetic treatment for cancer is that epigenetic mark are mitotically inherited. This means that changes to genetic regulation that inhibit cancer will spread as the cells divide and grow. Cancer drugs that change DNA methylation will make changes in treated cells that will spread the change in methylation to all subsequent cell.</p>
<p>This creates lasting effects on the expression of cancer inhibiting genes, such as growth suppressor genes.</p>
<p>There are times when such treatment may be more likely to have undesired effects. Especially during epigenetic sensitive periods. During these periods previous methylation marks are removed and reestablished with new regulation.  At these periods the use of methylation altering drugs would likely have unintended consequences either in the removal of the previous methylation marks or in the laying down of the new methylation marks.</p>
<p>These sensitive periods are during early embryo development and during the times when germ cells are maturing.  This means that such epigenetic treatment might not be advisable during pregnancy or during the early teen years.</p></div>
