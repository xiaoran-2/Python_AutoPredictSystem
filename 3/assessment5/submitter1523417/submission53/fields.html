    <h1>Submission 53 from Anon (session_user_id: 9a66e8b1d1342fd91c0c5e65a39353cc6e273679)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called hypomethylating agents. It accomplishes this hypomethylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine reduces the spreading and multiplying of tumor cells, but has no affect on nearby normal cells – thus Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation means silencing of a gene, with the primary exception of imprinted genes. CpG islands are often found at promoters, and tend to be protected from DNA methylation. In cancer, CpG islands are tumor suppressor genes are DNA hypermethylated. This leads to a multitude of diseases – including retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. CpG islands can act as a biomarker to distinguish tumorous from benign cells. Also, we can detect CpG island methylator phenotype. Hypermethylation can cause loss of imprinting and loss of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are DNA methylated in normal function. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are DNA hypomethylated (undermethylated).  This leads to genomic instability, because of illegitimate recombination between repeats, action of repeats and transposition, and disruption to neighboring genes. In mouse models, hypomethylation due to deletion of <em>Dnmt1</em> in specific tissues increases genomic instability. In humans, mutations in <em>DNMT3B </em>result in ICF syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region of H19 is methylated, and the Igf2 cluster is expressed. Thus, H19 is not active on the paternal allele, causing distal enhancers to activate Igf2 upstream. On the maternal allele, CTCF blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 promoter , and instead promotes H19 expression. The imprint control region of H19 is unmethylated and Igf2 is repressed, thus H19 is maternally expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of H19 is methylated on both the paternal and maternal allele, leading to Igf2 overexpression. Igf2 is growth promoting, so too much of Igf2 results in too much growth. About disease: disrupting imprinting is a very early event that leads to preneoplastic tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Altering DNA methylation can lead to genomic instability, including illegitimate recombination between repeats, transpositions, deletions, insertions, and activation of cryptic promoters. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Sensitive periods of development include early development (blastocyst stage) and the period of primordial germ cell development.  Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because epigenetic alterations at that time are irreversible. The survival of the patient, not epigenetic modification, is most important during the sensitive period.</p></div>
