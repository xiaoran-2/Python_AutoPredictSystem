    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks helps during differentiation and development. They can affect how will be read genetic information.</p>
<p>DNAmethylation is one of epigenetic modification machinery. It means joining the methyl group on cytosine. Methylation of part of DNA can caused silencing of the gene.</p>
<p>In the cancer cells can be methylated cytosine mutated on thymin by deamination.</p>
<p>DNA methylations are rare in CpG dinucleotides. In this regions are around 60% of promoters in human genome. However in cancer cells are ussualy become CpG island hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Methylated CpG islands can prohibit binding of transcription factors and alter gene expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the intergenic regions DNA methylation in normal condition maintain genomic integrity. For example by methylation is preventing expression of repeats and transposition of this repeats by mutation cytosin base on thymin. In the repetitive elements is DNA methylation protect genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alterations in DNA methylation include genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation.In the cancer stage are found hypomethylation of DNA which causes genomic instability due to silencing of tumor suppressor genes. In analogy to genetic mutation,tumors shows accumulation of DNA methylation during tumor progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTGF is an insulator protein, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation blocks binding of CTGF.</p>
<p>Without CTCF on the paternal allele,DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate its expression.</p>
<p>If the maternal allele behaves like described paternal allele (due to mutation or deletion) caused the loss of imprinting. This uniparental disomy (UPD) is afecting the gene expression is caused by epigenetic disruption. Overdose of Igf2 (and/or other genes) causing fetal and post-natal overgrowth of the organism. (eg. Overgrowth of the tongue). With this feature is common predisposition to embryotic and child tumours.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumour, which afect childrens kidney. Maternal transmission from carrier mother to affected offspring is 50% of casses. Other 50% are unaffected and not carriers. Mans are just carriers. This disorder is not sex-specific. The disease is caused by loss of Cdk1c tumour supressor and upregulation of Igf2 oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The farmaceutics companies tried to produce a lot of new medicaments for supporting the cancer curing as chemotherapy. One from the novel drugs are drugs which efect epigenetic modification of genome. There is way when the tumor or leukemias are developing without background of genetic mutations or aberations of chromosome.</p>
<p>The scientiscs find out that can be connection between epigenetic changes and cancer. Among epigenetic changes they count mainly methylation and acetylation of functional groups on DNA and  histones.</p>
<p>Decitabine is one from FDA approved drug that belongs to DNMT inhibitors group.</p>
<p>The DMTi binds to nucleooside analogs and after that they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an impact on epigenetic modifications, concretely on DNAmethylation. It is DNA-demethylation agent, which can help with the therapy of myelodysplastic syndromes and its progressed desease – AML.</p>
<p>Due to DNA hypermethylation can develop chromosomal instability. Then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumotigenesis. Decitabine as DNA demethylation agent can suppress chromosomal instability in the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some of epigenetic marks are heritable. In the development of organism are sensetive periods. In this periods is processing reprogramming of imprinted genes and can be imprinted disorders as germ cell tumors, tumorogenesis etc. Sensitive period are early development and in primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>One from the specific epigenetic modification is DNAmethylation. It means joining the methyl group on cytosine within CpG dinucleotides(where are most of promoters). However in cancer cells are ussualy become CpG island hypermethylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation maintaine through cell division. In mammals it is laid down de novo by methyl transferases DNMT3a and DNMT3.</p>
<p>For the function of the genes DNAmethylation causes sinencing of the methylated region.</p>
<p>Treating the patients with drugs which affect epigenetic changes can be harmful in the periods of reprogramming of imprinted genes. It could caused hypomethylation or hypermethylation of genom and lead to genomic instability or hypermethylation of tummor supressor genes, translocations in the genome, overexpressions of the genes, CpG hypermethylation and silencing or point mutation. It could caused the development of tumorogenesis.</p></div>
