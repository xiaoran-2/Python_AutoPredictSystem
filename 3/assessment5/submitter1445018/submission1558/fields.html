    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genetic imprinting is  the expression of certain genes in a parent of origin specific manner with genes expressed from the non-imprinted allele. In the H19/igf2 gene cluster the ICR located  H19 and igf2 is paternally imprinted. The umethylated ICR on maternal chromosome is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF that prevents the looping of enhancers downstream of H19 to the igf2 gene thus blocking its expression. The enhancers loop to H19 activating gene expression of lncRNA. Paternally methylated ICR  blocks CTCF binding. This results in the spread of methylation to the H19 promoters. H19 is silenced, the  enhancers downstream of the H19 gene  loop and access igf2 resulting in the activation of the gene.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting on the H19/igf2 cluster either through hyper- or- hypomethylation of the ICRs on bothe chromosomes results in Wilm’s tumor from  loss of expression of growth suppression genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.  This results in the presence of excess growth promoting gene product, or the absence of growth suppression gene products. In both cases, the result is uncontrolled cell increase in the number of cells, a situation that results in the formation of tumors especially in neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group is added to the 5’ group of cytosines. This can occur in CpG islands, intergenic regions and on repetitive elements. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. When methylated, it is often at  promoters and is associated with silencing of gene expression especially between cell types, or in inactivation of the X chromosome. Hypermethylation of CpG islands often results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes (one hint of Knudson hypothesis) and is frequently observed tumors. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is often mitotically inherited, selected for, are reversible, varies by tumor type and progresses with time, e.g., Rb in retinoblastoma. In CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), a set of genes are frequently methylated and the methylation patterns associated with distinct cancers, with high hypermethylation associated with poor prognosis. Methylation seen on CpG island shores are correlates with gene expression and may be predictor of tumor progression than CpG island methylation.</p>
<p>Methylation of Intergenic regions (IG) and repetitive elements (RE)  is associated with genomic stability. Hypomethylation of these regions can occur genome wide and occurs in all tumors. Hypomethylation  is an indication of tumorigenicity, depends on location and is more frequent in repetitive elements. Hypothemethylation at IG and RE results in genomic instability as a result of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. The resulting deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions disrupts gene expression and may result in overexpression of oncogenes and suppression of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation by use of drugs that target the epigenome may affect cancer cells more than normal cells since cancer cells divide more frequently. In addition irreversibly preventing epigenetic copying to the daughter cells reduces methylation levels in the epigenome. However the long term effects of the DNA methylation targeting drugs is not known. The effect of these drugs on regular epigenetic mechanisms that are associated with development in not know. For instance, their effect of  laying of epigenetic control during the sensitive periods of developments when epigenetic markers are being laid down as part of normal development is not known. These senstive periods occur during epigenetic reprogramming in early development (the preimplantation period when paternal X chromosome is silenced (2-4 cell stage), maintanace of imprinted X chromosome inactivation in extra embronic tissue blastocyst), random X inactivation and mentanace of X random X inactivation in somatic cells and primordial germ cells development. Thus use of systemic drugs may inhibit normal epigenetic development especially in the young</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer drugs that target epigenetic causes of cancer are geared to inhibiting the action of enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Decitabine is an DNA demethylating agent (DNMT inhibitors) that together with histone-deacetylase inhibitor has been shown to delay tumor growth in advanced lung cancer. Decitabine and other DNMT inhibitors are nucloside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMTS after they have been incorporated into DNA. They are replication dependent but their mechanism of action has not been clearly defined. Decitabine  acts by making tumors susceptible to standard chemotherapy by acting to erase epigentic markers of DNA in tumor cells.</p></div>
