    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is characterised by a genome-wide loss and regional acquisition of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands in gene promoters are usually protected from methylation to allow gene expression. In cancer, locus-specific CpG island hypermethylation frequently occurs and silences tumour suppressor genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair<em> </em>due to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. Hypermethylation of CpG islands progresses with time and can be one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis needed to drive a cancerous phenotype. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, CpG island hypermethylation can be rapidly selected for as it confers a growth advantage. Hypermethylation of CpG islands can also spread to the neighbouring 2 kb regions, CpG island shores, altering gene expression.</p>
<p>Whereas normal cells show methylation at intergenic and repetitive elements, this is progressively lost in cancer cells resulting in genome-wide hypomethylation. The main function of this DNA methylation is to maintain genome integrity: methylation at these regions results in highly compacted DNA that prevents misalignment of repeats and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, hypomethylation of repeats leads to an open chromatin conformation allowing repeats to align and reciprocal translocations to occur. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements also allows the repeats to be activated and transpose to different sites in the genome disrupting a gene's coding sequence or activating neighbouring genes by activation of cryptic promoters. Ultimately, DNA hypomethylation at intergenic and repetitive elements leads to chromosomal deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions resulting in tumourigenesis.</p>
<p>Although less common than hypomethylation of repeats, CpG-poor promoters can be hypomethylated in cancer leading to activation of genes such as the oncogene R-Ras or miR21 that targets the tumour suppressor PTEN. In normal cells, methylation of CpG-poor promoters prevents transcription factors from binding resulting in gene silencing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele allowing the downstream enhancers to promote Igf2 expression. The methylation at the ICR spreads to the H19 promoter on the paternal allele, which is therefore silenced. In contrast, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This allows the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein, which prevents the downstream enhancers from promoting Igf2 expression, which is in effect silenced. Instead, the enhancers act on H19 promoting its expression from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, a childhood kidney tumour, loss of imprinting occurs at the ICR on the maternal allele resulting in its hypermethylation. This prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR and therefore the downstream enhancers can promote Igf2 expression from the maternal allele. As is observed on the paternal allele, methylation at the maternal ICR spreads to the H19 promoter and H19 expression is silenced. Hypermetylation of the ICR on the maternal allele in Wilm’s tumour results in the expression of Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal alleles: twice as much growth-promoting Igf2 is expressed compared to normal cells resulting in Wilm’s tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferases once they have been incorporated into the DNA upon replication. Since cancer cells replicate more often than normal cells, this drug will preferentially target actively dividing cancer cells over normal cells. At high doses, Decitabine has non-specific toxic effects. However at lower therapeutic doses, Decitabine treatment causes DNA demethylation resulting in tumour cell death and anti-neoplastic effects. Although its exact mechanism of action is still unclear, it is likely that treatment with Decitabine results in decreased methylation of CpG islands of promoters of tumour suppressor genes allowing their expression and resulting in an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable, stable epigenetic mark. After every cell division DNA methylation is copied onto the daughter strand of DNA by DNMT1, which recognises hemi-methylated DNA and lays down the methylation on the unmethylated daughter strand of DNA thereby restoring a fully methylated CpG dinucleotide. Drugs that alter DNA methylation will have long lasting effects as once the DNA methylation pattern has been altered, it will be passed on to daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments may have an effect on epigenetic control. They correspond to early embryonic development (pre- and early post-implantation) and primordial germ cell development during which active reprogramming of the epigenome takes place. It would not be advisable to treat patients during these sensitive periods as it may have long-lasting effects on future generations by interfering with epigenetic reprogramming. For example, treatment of expectant mothers with drugs that alter DNA methylation may result in improper DNA methylation in developing embryos or in the primordial germ cells of the foetus. Similarly, treatment of children with immature germ cells may alter DNA methylation of their developing germ cells. This would result in long-lasting transgenerational effects with undesired consequences.</p></div>
