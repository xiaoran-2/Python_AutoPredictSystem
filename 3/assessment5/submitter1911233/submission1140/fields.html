    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, most CpG islands, gene promoter regions rich in C and G nucleotides, are not methylated in order to allow gene expression. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which do not usually contribute to gene expression, are methylated in order to prevent genetic instability, which can arise from unintended transposition into other areas of the genome. Epigenetic changes in cancer cells may vary between tumor type or cancer type, but the following examples generally hold true. When CpG islands of important genes like tumor suppressors become aberrantly hypermethylated, this can contribute to tumorigenesis by silencing the tumor suppressor. Likewise, aberrant hypomethylation of non-C &amp; G rich oncogene promoters can also contribute to tumorigenesis by allowing activation or overexpression of the oncogene. Similarly, aberrant hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements may promote activation of a transposon that could be inserted in a critical region and disrupt a tumor suppressor, promote activation of a cryptic promoter that could activate an oncogene, or could lead to increased genetic instability due to illegitimate recombination or translocation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of epigenetic imprinting, particularly in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster, is one mechanism that can contribute to tumorigenesis. Under normal conditions in the imprinting control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated and accessible to enhancers, leading to expression of the growth promoter Igf2. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated and insulated from enhancers due to the binding of CTCF. Thus, Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. In patients with Wilm’s tumor, aberrant hypermethylation of the maternal allele leads to Igf2 expression from both parental alleles, as CTCF will no longer bind to and insulate the methylated maternal allele. The resulting “double dose” of Igf2 promotes tumorigenesis by providing a larger growth factor source for the tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, belonging to the DNA demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors and is commonly used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Treating cells with Decitabine leads to the irreversible binding of DNA methyltransferase during replication, thereby preventing methylation of the newly synthesized daughter strand of DNA. This is particularly important for preventing improper methylation of CpG islands that control tumor suppressor genes. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, cancer cells can be highly affected by Decitabine treatment to prevent hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation can have enduring effects because of the heritability of epigenetic marks. A rapidly dividing cancerous cell that has hypermethylated a particular tumor suppressor can pass that hypermethylated state onto a daughter cell. While epigenetic drugs present a possible treatment option to reverse or prevent tumor suppressor hypermethylation, epigenetic drugs are non-selective and will affect both cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This is one reason why treating young patients with non-selective methyltransferase inhibitors may not be advantageous, as such treatment may disrupt normal germ cell developmental processes. Germ cell development is a developmental period referred to as a sensitive period, or a time during development when specific epigenetic marks must be put in place to ensure proper regulation of gene expression. Global inhibition of the epigenetic machinery during sensitive periods like germ cell development may lead to aberrant activation or silencing of genes needed for either sperm or egg cell development. </p></div>
