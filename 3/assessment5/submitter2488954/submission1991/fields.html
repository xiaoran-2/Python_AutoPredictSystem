    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is a process that occours with the addiction of methyl group to the adenine or cytosine at DNA nucleotides. Most of theses methylation occours between cytosine and guanine in the linear sequences. In CpG islands - regions of genoma that contain high frequency of CpG sites - enzymes called DNA methyltransferases transform cytosine in to the 5-methylcytosine.</p>
<p>Many aberrant DNA methylation patterns seem to be associated to some kinds of cancer through genomic instability and disregulation of imprinted genes. As high level of methylation of the promoter regions leads to silence transcription, hypermethylation may cause stochasticly silcence of a tumor supressor gene, genomic instability and disregulation of imprinted genes. Hyp<span style="font-size:14px;">o or h</span><span style="font-size:14px;">ypermethylation can result in loss of expression of growth </span><span style="font-size:14px;">restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Beyond this, the 5-methylcytosine is prone to deamination to thymine, causing a mutation.</span></p>
<p>In intergenic regions and in repetitive elements the DNA is usually methylated to silence cryptic transcription, start sites or cryptic splice sites and to silence of repeats to prevent transposition and avoiding transcriptional interference from promoters. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats lead to genomic instability, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and a<span style="font-size:14px;">ctivation of cryptic promoters and disruption to </span><span style="font-size:14px;">neighbouring genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">Hypermethylation and hypomethylation at the <span style="font-size:14px;">IGF2-H19 </span><span style="font-size:14px;">imprinting control region (ICR) result in changes in </span><span style="font-size:14px;">IGF2-</span><span style="font-size:14px;">H19 </span><span style="font-size:14px;">expression and growth disorders</span><span style="font-size:14px;">.

The imprinted expression of the closely linked Igf2 and H19 genes is controlled by specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The H19 DMR is located 5′ of the H19 promoter and is methylated on one chromosome and is known as the imprinting control region IC1 because it functions as an insulator mediated by the CCCTC binding factor (CTCF). Deletion of the IC1 of the other chromossome causes the activation of the normally silent Igf2 allele and in down-regulation of H19. Methylation analysis of the IGF2-H19 seems to be related to the hypomethylation of this DMR and associated with loss of imprinting in Wilms tumour and colorectal cancer.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a drug that causes the hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. <span>Decitabine is a chemical analogue of cytosine nucleotide that can be incorporated to the DNA, as It is a desoxyribonucleoside. It is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), working by having a toxic effect on the abnormal (MDS) cells and possibly also removing methyl groups from DNA. This may decrease the methylation and consequent effects of gene silencing mechanisms. Demethylation may reduce the stability of silencing signals and thus confer relative gene activation. In the cases in that tumor suppressors genes has been hypermethylized, the usage of Decitabine may reduce methylation of theses genes, activating them and acting against the tumor.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a process that can be altered and last for long time, because some changes in methylation occours in some period of development of the organism - sensitive period - and it's hardly changed later this period. These changes may remain through cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations, even though there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism, but non-genetic factors that alterate genes' behavior. <span style="font-size:14px;">Then, the effect of drugs that alter DNA methylation may remain through mitotic cell divisions and it's passed to the next generations of cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Early life constitutes the sensitive period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. There is a relation between sensory experience and innate genetic programs causing the sculpting of neuronal circuits during early brain development. In this period, treatments that interfere in the methylation, may cause disrupt in the normal methylation leading to altered delelopment of the neural circuits.</span></p></div>
