    <h1>Submission 560 from Anon (session_user_id: 22f4603b1f55254db5452e558f7684e659f781e8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation marks can be passed on during cell division to daughter cells so drugs that alter methylation state can have an effect even after treatment has ceased. Treating patients with such drugs during sensitive periods is inadvisable however as there may be long-term effects on epigenetic state and hence gene expression in all tissues and particularly in germ cells, raising the possibility of such drugs having an effect on the next generation. During sensitive periods such as early postnatal development and germ cell development (early puberty), the genome is particularly sensitive to epigenetic influences</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated. In contrast, in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. CpG islands are often found in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes. These genes are active in normal cells, surppressing tumor growth. Methylation means that these genes are silenced in cancer cells. This methylation is mitotically heritable and cells showing this methylation have a competitive advantage</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are in general methylated in normal cells, its main function meaning to maintain genomic stability. In contrast, these regions are hypomethylated in cancer cells. This hypomethylation most commonly occurs at repeats and leads to illegitimate recombination and general genomic instability including translocations, deltions and insertions. Overall genomic hypomethylation tends to increase with the stage of tumor growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating drug. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase leading to hypomethylation. It therefore weakens gene silencing mechanisms, particularly tumor suppressor genes. It is primarily used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2H19 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.This results in expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele but not on the maternal allele.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">When imprinting is lost, the maternal allele is also hypermethylated resulting ina double dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting and this is what is observed in Wilms tumour.</span></p></div>
