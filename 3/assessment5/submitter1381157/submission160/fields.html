    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG's often form clusters near the promoters of genes (so called CpG Islands) Methylation of a CpG island will lead to gene silencing, but in general CpG islands are unmethylated in normal cells. Hypermethylation of CGIs near tumor surpressor genes will often occur in cancers , leading to silencing of the tumor surpressor gene. In this way, disruption of DNA methylation at CGIs (hypermethylation) will stimulate tumorgenesis, since it will silence the genes that normally would surpress tumor formation/growth.</p>
<p>By contrast, in normal cells there is usually methylation of intergenic regions an repeats. This is needed for the maintenance of genomic stability and also to prevent the transposition and disruptive effects on other genes by repeats.</p>
<p>In cancer, however we see in general genome-wide hypomethylation of the DNA. The DNA will show a more heterochromatin-like structure, which will increase genomic instability in the form of deletions, translocations or duplications. Hypomethylation of repeats can also activate the repeats, who will now be able to 'jump around' on the chromosome, and interact with neighbouring genes and in this way have a negative effect on them (activating cryptic promotors, silencing active genes, etc) This can lead to/contribuate to tumorgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. This will block the binding of the CTCF protein. If the CTCF protein cannot bind, enhancers can interact with and activate the Igf2 gene expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is NOT methylated, and therefor the CTCF protein can bind the ICR. The CTCF protein will block the enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene expression. The enhancers however, also can interact with and activate another gene (the H19 gene) which lays downstream from the ICR region.  CTCF has no effect on the activation of the downstream H19 gene, and thus, the H19 gene will be transcribed.</p>
<p>So in normal cells, only the paternal allele expresses Igf2.</p>
<p>Loss of impriting can cause disease, since it can lead to loss or gain of both alleles: this affects the amount of gene product of a certain gene. In the case of Wilmstumour, there will, in addition to the paternal allele, also be  methylation of the maternal ICR. CTCF can also no longer bind the maternal ICR, enhancers thus will also activate the Igf2 gene. This leads to a double dosis of Igf2. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this leads to tumor genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a  DNMTinhibitor (DNMTi) and causes hypomethylation of the DNA.</p>
<p>DNA demethylation will occur, and in this way Decitabine can block/reverse tumor surpressor hypermethylation at CpG islands, which will make the expression of  tumor surpressor genes possible again. In this way Decitabine will surpress tumorgrowth, by activating tumor surpressor genes, that inhibit tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, the effect of the epigenetic drugs can last beyond the period of treatment. Altering the DNA methylation can thus have enduring effects on the epigenome, since it gets passed on to daughter cells during mitotic cell division.</p>
<p>There are 2 major periods during a person's life that are epigenetically sensitive. During early development (from the pre-implantation to the early implantation stadium) and during the primordial germ cell development, epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed. If we would treat a patient with drugs that alter the epigenetic state of the DNA during the period when primordial germcells develop, this can have an effect on the germcells and later on, it can affect the next generation if these altered germcells are 'used to make offspring'. Its also possibly dangerous to treat a pregnant woman, during the early development of the child, since these drugs can also have unwanted effects on the baby's DNA and development.</p>
<p>This is why doctors should not treat a person with these kinds of drugs during epigenetic sensitive periods, since this can have unwanted effects on the offspring (directly on the developing embryo or on the germ cells)</p></div>
