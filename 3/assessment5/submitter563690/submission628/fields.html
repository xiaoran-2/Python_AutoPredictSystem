    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer one can observe a wide array of disruptions of the epigenetic machinery: as regards the methylation profile, one can find a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation coupled with a locus specific DNA hypermethylation. CpG islands, clusters or zones of high density of CpG dinucleotides which are mostly found in promoters, tend to be unmethylated in the normal cell; methylation acts as a way to silence gene expression, principally by inducing a repressive chromatine structure in cis (for example, by binding of MeCP proteins). In cancer a local hypermethylation of CpG islands (and regions neighbouring them, called CpG islands shores) is often observed: this alteration of the epigenoma leads to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. The locus that is affected by this kind of epigenetic mutation varies with tumour type. Hypomethylation acts in the opposite way, and it is observed to some degree in all tumour types. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, as well as some CpG poor promoters, are normally silenced throught methylation to assure genetic stability and to prevent the expression of oncogenic factors. Demethylation can thus lead to the activation of transposons, which can cause gene disruption by replicating themselves in the DNA sequence, and the activation of gene-deleting elements; hypomethylated repeats can be the origin of translocations between non-homologous chromosomes. The less common case of hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters relates to the expression of oncogenic factors, as the miRNA miR21. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation can, moreover, impact on ICRs, causing a loss of printing which can be the orign of a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An alteration of the methylation profile of an ICR can lead to tumor genesis thorught overexpression of oncogenes or dowregulation/silencing of tumor suppressor factors. In the H19/lgf2 cluster, maternal and paternal alleles have different methylation patterns; the maternal allele is unmethylated at this region ICR: this allow for the DNA binding of the insulator protein CTCF, that shields the lgf2 (upstream in respect to the ICR) from expression-promoting factors (enhancers, located downstream of the ICR), which then acts only on the H19 gene (situated downstream of the ICR but upstream of the enhancers), increasing its expression. Methylation at the ICR in the paternal allele blocks the CTCF from binding, causing thus an activation/upregulation of the lfg2 gene. Moreover, methylation at the ICR spreads to the surrounding DNA region (no more protected by the insulating effect of CTCF), reaching the H19 promoter and thus silencing it. In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation at the ICR in the maternal allele leads to a disruption of the imprinting scheme: both the alleles present a paternal-like methylation profile, that causes the overexpression of lgf2, which is a growth-promoting factor with oncogenic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) class of drugs. It acts on those enzymes, like DNMT1 and DNMT3, whose purpose is the methylation of DNA. DNMTi are nucleotide analogs which works by incorporating in the DNA at the moment of replication, and then binding irreversibly to DNMTs, thus terminating their action. This mechanism is replication dependant, and for this reason the effect of the drug should be maximum in tumourous cells, which divides at greater rate. This class of drugs, when administered in the correct dose, reduces DNA methylation and is hypothetically effective againts those tumours whose origin is dependent on DNA hypermethylation (e.g.: tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation); at the moment, Decitabine, along with Vidaza, is approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome when progressed to acute myelogenous leukaemia. However, the exact mechanism of action of these drugs in fighting cancer is still not completely known.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, thus a modification in a cell methylation pattern is propagated to the subsequent cell generations. An alteration of the methylation profile that causes a cell to be more susceptible to the action of a certain drug, is then passed onto all the progeny, and may well be effective in rendering tumourous cells, which divides at greater rates, more vulnerable against standard chemotherapy. As this kind of DNA methylation-modifying drugs acts on the epigenetic machinery, their use should be avoided in the "epigenetically sensitive" periods, that is those moments when extensive epigenetic reprogramming is going on. In this periods there's a complete (or almost complete) removal of epigenetic marks, followed by the deposition of "ex novo" marks. A drug disrupting these processes may lead to unhealthy consequences. These sensitive periods are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell and germ cell development: for this reason one should be wary in the use of these drugs in the case of younger patients and pregnant women.</p></div>
