    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">As far as I know, CpG islands are in the upstream of a gene. So if CpG islands are methylated, a gene would be inactive. It is an important way for a cell to choose which gene should be expressed or closed. In the case of cancer, CpG island can be hypermethylated in two forms, one is single gene hypermethylation, the other is a set of genes are frequently methylated .both of these could cause some tumor suppressor genes inactive. For example, because of hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 loses its maternal imprinting and over expresses in Wilm’s tumors. Also, the CpG poor promoters can be hypomethylated, thus in consequently may lead to the activation of oncogene, like the case of R-RAS in gastric cancer. In the normal condition, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is important for the stability of the genome. However, in cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive element is hypomethylated, which lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats , activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes .all of these finally cause genomic instability. With an unstable genome, one must get diseases easily, include cancer and other serious diseases.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the H19/Igf2 cluster, CTCF is an insulator protein, which binds to H19/Igf2 cluster's ICR. In the paternal case,  DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. then without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence. Consequently, the enhancer near the cluster enhances the expression of Igf2.however,in the maternal case, CTCF bind to the ICR, so the enhancer can't enhances the expression of Igf2.Meanwhile,H19 promoter is not mathylated, which means in the maternal condition, the enhancer bind to the H19 promoter, and make H19 expressed. But in Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated in a paternal way, which leads to the Igf2 over expression and then -the tumors. In the general way, Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, over expression of growth promoting genes. Also in the case of Igf2, it not only are associated with Wilm’s tumor, but also Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, rhabdomyosarcoma, and Silver-Russell syndrome.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, also called DNMTi. They are nucleoside analogues, which can irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. So they can have a DNA demethylation effect. Why they can have an anti-tumor effect? May be hematological malignancies are dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation, silencing of the tumor suppressor gene cause some DNA damaged cell survival improperly, which lead to a cancer. So if Decitabine is added, the tumor suppressors gene may express normally, which can lead the tumor cell or other cell which shouldn't survival normally to death.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">As we all know the epigenetic information can be passed by mitosis, and the epigenetic drugs are not so specific to the tumor cells. So the drugs altered DNA methylation can have a long run in the epigenome in both normal cells and tumor cells. As the case of sensitive period, it means a period of time which you are very sensitive to the environment, in different kinds environment one may have different kinds of epigenetic marks in their genome. But in other time, the environment may not count so much. In the period of development, two periods are very important, one is PGC development, the other is early development, both of the period involve in maternal and paternal genome reprogramming. If we treat patients during sensitive period, the reprogramming may be disrupted, some gene may express improperly, which can lead to diseases or even cancer.</span></p></div>
