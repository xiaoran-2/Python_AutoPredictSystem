    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the CpG islands are methylated to suppress promotors when appropriate (e.g., for tissue specific expression, x-inactivation).  During cancer, you tend to see hypermethylation of the CpG islands specific to tumor suppressor (growth inhibition) promotor sites, which allows the cell cycle reproduction (mitosis) to continue unchecked, contributing to the disease process.  </p>
<p>In the repetitive element and intergenic sites, a normal cell will tend to have a high methylation rate, which helps to suppress transposons residing at those sites, as well as inhibiting unwelcome recombination at repeat sequence sites.  During cancer, these areas are hypomethylated, which interferes with these natural mechanisms and contributes to disease by increased genomic instability.  When transposons are no longer suppressed, mutation rates increase and cancerous genomic variation is much more likely.   Similarly, recombination events at repetitive elements also increases the risk ang genomic instability associated with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at the H19 imprint control region (ICR), which blocks the binding of the CTCF insulator protein, which would otherwise insulate the lgf2 from downstream enhancers.  These enhancers can reach the Igf2 locus and activate transcription in the paternal allele.  In the maternal allele, the CTCF protein can bind and insulate the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, supressing the Igf2 expression.  </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor cases, the maternal allele also experiences methylation at the H19 ICR, which induces the same mechanism of Igf2 promotion via increased enhancer access to the Igf2 site, effectively doubling the transcription of the Igf2 protein.  Igf2, or Insulin-like growth factor, like many paternally imprinted genes, is a growth promotor and the excess of expression in the disrupted cells contribute to the runaway mitosis characteristic of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine and azacitidine are both demethylating agents which operate on the DNA.  By removing and/or preventing methylation of the genome, the suppression of transcription of tumor-suppressor genes is inhibited; these tumor suppressors play key roles in preventing cancers.  These demethylating agents are used to treate myeloid-related dysplasias (myelodysplastic syndromes) in humans.</p>
<p>Perhaps the demethylating agents such as these can be used to treat solid tumors; a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine showed slower solid tumor growth in some patients with advanced lung cancer; those who didn't show this improvement sometimes had a better result from subsequent chemotherapy as well. This indicates that perhaps the tumor cells are semi-permanently altered via epigenetic marks which makes them more susceptible to chemotherapeutic treatments than they were originally.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inherited mitotically, therefore can have a lasting effect on the epigenome.  Once the reduced methylation is established, this inheritance can be brought forward even after the drug which initiated the change is withdrawn.  Since epigenetic marks tend to persist until actively erased, these changes can effect lasting changes.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where epigenetic reprogramming is taking place, such as in the pre-implantation embryo and during active germ cell development (gametogenesis).  It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, since the epigenetic marks are in a state of transition and the effects could be much larger and more unpredictable than during non-sensitive periods.  It has been shown that genetic stressors during these sensitive periods have a much larger destabilizing effect than at other periods.</p></div>
