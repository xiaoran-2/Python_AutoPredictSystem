    <div class="field-value"><p>Two major alterations in methylation play an important role in cancer.  In one, hypermethylation, an increase of methylation compared to normal, at specific genetic loci, reduces the effectiveness of genes that would suppress tumors.  In the other, decreased methylation in a more genome-wide manner, but most notably in repetitive regions and CpG poor promoter regions, leads to instability of the genome, and tumorgenesis.</p>
<p>Normally, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated.  In cancer, however, there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promotors (i.e., upstream) of tumor suppressor genes, which leads to them being inactivate, and unable to suppress tumors.  Because methylation is mitotically heritable, this inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes can be maintained.  And because the cells with the tumor suppressor gene turned off can divide more rapidly, they will proliferate more quickly than normal cells.   The particular group of CpG island that becomes hypermethylated appears to vary with the type of cancer, with certain cancers characterized by hypermethylation of one set of CpG islands, and another cancer characterized by hypermethylation of a different set of CpG islands, so that the pattern of CpG hypermethylation across the entire genome varies by tumor subtype. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are associated with cancer.  In normal cells, these regions tend to be methylated.  Such methylation serves to maintain genomic stability, by minimizing deletions, insertions, and illegitimate combinations of genes, such as reciprocal translocations, because the DNA is not open (i.e., is heterochromatin).  However, in cancer, these intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to become hypomethylated, leading them to be open and susceptible to such alterations.  Mouse models, in which we can more easily examine cause and effect show that those tissues lacking <em>Dnmt1</em>, which codes for dimethyltransferase that allows for methylation, tend to have tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon where there is only expression of one gene and that gene is specific to the parent-of-origin.  Genomic imprinting occurs by methylation of an imprint control region (ICR). This methylation occurs during primordial germ cell development, which allows for parent-specific effects, which are maintained in the embryo and throughout development. One common mechanism of imprinting is through enhancer/insulator blocking.  In the case of <em>H19/Igf2</em>, the maternal allele is unmethylated, while the paternal allele is methylated, and hence imprinted.  When the ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by CTCF, an insulator protein, which insulates the <em>Igf2 </em>gene from downsteam enhancers.  Because <em>Igf2</em> is insulated, the enhancers are now free to act on <em>H19</em>, enhancing its expression. Because the ICR is methylated on the paternal chromosome, CTCF cannot bind to it, and the promotors are free to enhance expression of <em>Igf2.  </em>Furthermore, there is no binding at the <em>H19 </em>gene on the paternal allelle, because methylation spreads to the promotor region of the <em>H19 </em>gene. When there is methylation on <em>both</em> the maternal and paternal alleles, it leads to a double dose of <em>Igf2,</em> resulting in Wilm’s tumor, a childhood kidney tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor, and reduces the degree to which a CpG island is methylated.  Removing DNA methylation aids in treating cancer because this myelodyspalstic syndrome is caused by <em>hypermethylation.  </em> In normal situations, CpG islands tend not to be methylated.  In cancer, there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoters (i.e., upstream) of tumor suppressor genes, which leads to them being inactivate, and hence unable to suppress tumor development. Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analog, meaning that it gets incorporated into the DNA during replication.  When the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) comes along to bind it, it gets irreversibly bound to the drug, meaning that it is not available to transfer methyl groups and cause methylation.  Of note, a cell must be dividing for this effect to occur.  This generally is not a problem because cancer cells divide more rapidly than normally developing cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because epigenetic markers are mitotically heritable, they may be particularly useful in treating cancer.  If one can alter methylation in a cancer cell, this change will be inherited by the progeny of that cancer cell, which might make them more susceptible to the influence of chemotherapeutic agents and/or lead to less potent forms of cancer. However, there are two periods during development in which all epigenetic markers are removed – during production of gametes, and during the very early stages of embryonic development (until the blastocyst stage).  Right after these stages, epigenetic markers are laid down, serving critical processes such as cell differentiation.  If such anti-cancer drugs are given during these sensitive stages of development when epigenetic markers are being laid down, they might alter or interfere with critical aspects of development.  Such considerations would suggest that giving these anti-cancer drugs to a woman who has just very recently become pregnant (e.g., within the last 6-12 hours) could have negative consequences on her fetus.  It also suggests that such agents could have deleterious effects on any sperm that are produced or eggs that become mature during the time of treatment with these drugs</p></div>
