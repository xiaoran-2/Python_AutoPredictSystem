    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are repeats of C and G nucliotides within the genome.  They are often found in or near promoters of genes.  In normal cells the CpG islands are rarely methalated.  In cancer cells CpG islands are often hypermethylated, as CpG islands are involved in the promoters of genes, methylation of the CpG island will silence the gene.  Cancer cells often have hypermethylationof CpG islands in tumor supressor genes.  </p>
<p>The Methylation state of other regions of the genome are also different in cancer cells.  In healthy cells there is usaully methylation of intergenic regions, repetative elements are introns of genes.  In cancer a reverse of this is seen with genome wide hypomethalation.  The reason repetative elements are methylated in normal cells is to protect against genomic instability.  During recombination areas that are very simlar can match up attatch to each other.  This is only ment to happen at specific regions of the genome but could happen at repetative elements.  To protect against aberant recombinations the repetative elements are usually heavily methylated and densly packaged in chromatin.  In cancer cells the repetative elements are unmethylated which allows incorrect recombination.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Inimprint control regions methylated does not nessissarily mean silancing as it does in CPG islands.  The H19/Igf2 cluster is epigenetically different in the maternal and paternal copy.  Incorrect imprinting of these epigenetic marks leads to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
<p>In the maternal copy the promoter of Igf2 is unmethylated, this allows CTCF protein to bind to the promoter, insulating it against transcription.  Because this gene is blocked, H19 wich is futher downstream is expressed instead.  On the paternal copy the Igf2 promoter and H19 gene is methylated, the CTCF is unable to bind to the Igf2 promoter and so Igf2 is expressed.  </p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome there are two copies of the paternally imprinted gene leading to an excess of Igf2 and not enough H19.  This syndrome is parent of origin specific and affected offspring will only be born to an affected or carrier mother.  </p>
<p>Wilm's tumour results in the disruption of normal expression of the H19/Igf2 cluster, as Igf2 is a growth promoter and H19 is a growth regulator an excess of Igf2 leads to the growth of tumours.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylator, removes methylation from CPG inlands allowing silenced tumour supressor genes to become active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is transmittied mitotically so changes in DNA methylation will be passed on to dividing cells.  If an epigenetic drug was able to affect the DNA methylation of cells in the body, this change in methylation could be passed on to new cells produced long after the drug was no longer being taken.  </p>
<p>Sensitive epigenetic periods are times that epigenetic remodeling takes place.  When gametes are forming, during the early period of fertilization and during cell differentation in the embrio are sensative periods.  It would be inadvisable to take epigenetic drugs during any of these sensative periods as it could affect the normally epigenetic imprinting from taking place.</p></div>
