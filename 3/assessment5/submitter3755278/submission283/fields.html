    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a basic mechanism by which epigenetic control is maintained.  When there is aberrant behavior in the process of laying down methyl groups either hypo or hyper methylation may result in one of the many forms of cancer.  Human DNA is surprisingly only 1.5% genes.  The rest is composed of elements described as repeats, CpG islands,  and intergenic regions.  In normal DNA CpG islands are not methylated.  In cancer cells the opposite is true, these islands are heavily methylated.  CpG islands are normally associated with strong promoters.  Methylating a strong promoter will silence the associated gene. Cancer results because there are many suppressor genes which become inoperative.  When this happens aberrant cell growth progresses in stages from normal tissue to hyperplasia, then neoplasia and finally excessive tissue mass frequently seen as a tumor. Aberrant methylation at intergenic and repetitive regions also contributes to cancer.  These regions are normally methylated, however, in cancer cells you find the opposite.  They are hypomethylated.  The methylation of repeats and intergenic regions provides genomic stability.  Without methylation, repeats and cryptic promoters are activated leading to disruption of neighboring genes.  This could for example result in activation of an oncogene at a CpG poor promoter.  An even larger disruption occurs with hypomethylation of repeats. This leads to genomic instability by messing up the chromosomes through deletions, insertions, and translocations.  The outcome here is likely aberrant expressions of genes and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting in normal cells means genes are expressed from from either the paternal or maternal allele.  Methylation determines which allele is imprinted.  This is done at the ICR or imprinting control region.  Methylation does not mean a gene is inactive rather you need to know how the cluster works.  Considering the H19/lgf2 cluster in a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR and the maternal is not. In the paternal allele enhancers are free to activate lgf2, an oncogene and thus growth promoting, through an action called chromatin looping.  In the maternal allele a binding protein (CTCF) sits at the unmethylated ICR and enhancers act on H19 instead of lgf2.  In Wilm's tumour hypermethylation at ICR allows both alleles to over express lgf2 leading to a cancer tumour.  If there is <em>hypo</em>methylation at the ICR imprinting is lost and lgf2 expression is diminished which then contributes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug, specifically a DNA-demethylating agent. Deciabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Demethylating a strong tumor suppressor promoter would allow the tumor suppressor gene to do it's job.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells until they are actively erased. That is to say, they are mitotically heritable  Thus an epigentic theraphy might halt tumor growth without having to destroy all of the tumor cells. A sensitive period is one where the genome is being demethylated and epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed. Treatments would have to avoid sensitive periods such as early deveopment of the blastocyst and primordial germ cell creation or incorrect reprogramming of the epigenome is likely.</p></div>
