    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in promoter regions leads to silencing of gene expression. In cancer, many normally unmethylated CpG islands are methylated resulting in silencing of gene expression. Other normally methylated CpG islands may be unmethylated in cancer, and therefore, genes that are normally silenced might be overexpressed. The first case might lead to silencing of expression of tumor suppressor genes. These genes normally exert a checking function and limit cell growth or might induce cell death as reaction to mutations and chromosomal rearrangments. The second case can result in higher than normal expression of oncogenes which leads to increased cell growth. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic stability. Cancer cells often lose methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This can lead to genomic instability, for example losses or gains of chromosomal regions or illegimate recombination between repeats on different chromosomes. These genomic changes might lead to the activation of repeats or transpositions. Another possibility is that the may cause the disruption of neighboring genes or the activation of cryptic promoters, which can affect expression of nearby genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele carries DNA methylation at the ICR. This allows the downstream enhancer regions to induce expression of the Igf2 gene. The maternal allele is not methylated permitting the binding of CTCF to an insulator region. As a consequence, the enhancer do not act on the Igf2 gene but induce expression of H19. In Wilms tumors, both alleles are methylated. This leads to loss of expression of H19 and overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth factor and its overexpression leads to abnormal growth and survival of the cells, which in turn can contribute to cancer formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which leads to DNA hypomethylation. The potential anti-tumor effect is exerted by reverting hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores. Hypermethylation in promoter regions leads to silencing of gene expression. Restoring the normal methylation patterns in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes can lead to killing of cancer cells. Also, hypermethylation can lead to aberrant expression of imprinted genes. Treatment with Decitabine might revert these malignant expression patterns.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are mitotically heritable and daughter cells have exactly the same DNA methylation marks as their parent cell. If DNA methylation is altered through drug treatment, these changes are passed on to the following generations of cells. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming, during which DNA methylation patterns are erased and reestablished. In human, there are two such sensitive periods, during early development before implantation of the embryo and during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it can interfere with this epigenetic reprogramming. This might make their children susceptible to diseases caused by improper DNA methylation patterns.</p></div>
