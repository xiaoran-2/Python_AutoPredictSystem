    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation in cancer include regional hypermethylation of CpG islands and genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation within promoter regions of genes negatively correlates with expression levels of the gene except in CpG islands, which are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer cells promoter CGIs tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. If this underlying gene is a tumour suppressor gene, inactivation of this gene leads to cancer development. CpG island shore methylation, in sequences up to 2kb distant, is also strongly related with gene expression. These regions represent tissue specific methylation in normal tissues and they are recently discovered to be differentially methylated in colorectal cancer, different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors.</p>
<p>Intragenic methylation is normally found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. Genome-wide loss of DNA methylation in cancer cells leads to genomic instability. This is due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations of DNA methylation at ICRs can lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In normal cells the maternal H19 and the paternal Igf2 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the maternal allele CTCF binds the hypomethylated region upstream of H19 and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. On the paternal allele DNA methylation blocks binding of CTCF and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, silences H19 and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate.</p>
<p>In tumors with loss of imprinting (e.g. in Wilm’s tumour), the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter: Igf2 turned on and H19 turned off, causing overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is a cytidine antimetabolite analogue that incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNA methyltransferase, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication.  It is used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. CpG methylation is essential for life. DNA methylation is established and maintained by specific DNA methyltransferases and is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length and predetermined gene expression states. Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks, rather than during maintenance of epigenetic marks. Embryogenesis, gametogenesis and early postnatal period are sensitive for epigenetic changes. If you would treat patients during this period, it would lead to epigenome wide changes, imprinting disorders or broader epigenetic abnormalities.</p></div>
