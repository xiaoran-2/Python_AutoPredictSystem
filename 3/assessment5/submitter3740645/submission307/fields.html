    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The knowledge of DNA methylation is essential to understand the different epigenetic phenomena. DNA methylation at CpG islands is one of the most known epigenetic processes that occur. In normal cells, generally, the CpG islands are unmethylated because DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing when found at promoters.<br />Nonetheless, in cancer cells, CpG island of a set of genes are frequently methylated. Thereby, this hypermethylation at CpG island in cancer cells is associated with inactivation of tumour suppressors (genes that make the cell die). The CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) is for colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, glioma and others.<br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are always methylated in a normal tissue. It's related with genomic stability. However, in a neoplastic tissue for example, the repetitive elements and intergenic region are unmethylated. This hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic region is associated with genomic instability like illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and trasposition. Futhermore, in cancer tissue, the disruption of DNA methylation can alter the ploidy and the chromatin organisation of the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR (imprinting control region) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. When it's not methylated the transcription factor CTCF binds the ICR, and enhancers in this case will act on H19. However, Igf2 will be silent in the maternal allele<br />In the paternal allele, because the ICR is methylated, the enhancers can act on Igf2 because CTCF isn't binding ICR. Then, Igf2 is expressed form the paternal allele.<br />Nonetheless, with loss of imprinting what happens is you have hypermethylation of the imprinting control region of the two alleles. So the Igf2 gene will be expressed in a double dose in comparison to what occurs in a normal cell, but Igf2 is growth promoting and that's related with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belogs to DNA-demethylating agent class and it is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA because it inactivates DNA methyltransferases. Futhermore, decitabine is an agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.<br /> Some speculations say decitabine aters the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The change of DNA methylation has enduring effects because it's mitotically heritable by the action of DNA methyltransferases. Therefore, it has  effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.<br /> In our life there are many sensitive periods. It refers to important periods of development when the epigenetic marks aren't so stable and more sensitive to perturbations.<br />Although, in mammals, the sensitive periods are the period of primordial germ cell development, the second period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period. These are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.<br />That's not hard to say why treating patients during sensitve periods is inadvisable, because these periods seem to be the most sensitve to changes in the enviroment.</p></div>
