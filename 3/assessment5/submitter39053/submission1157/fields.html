    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoters of genes silences gene expression. In cancer the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated (e.g. more methylated). This causes tumor suppressor genes to be silenced.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements make that portion of the DNA more densely compact (e.g. heterochromatin).This makes it less likely for the DNA in these regions to be transcribed. In cancer these areas are more likely to be hypomethylated (e.g. less methylated) creating euchromatin.</p>
<p>Since the repetitive regions are more open they can jump around the genome causing mutations of genes as well as expression of neighboring genes where they jump to. Also there can be illegitimate recombination between repeats. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation can also occur at CpG poor islands within the promoters for genes. This allows the transcription of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allele is unmethylated at the imprint control region. On the maternal allele this allows binding of CTCF to the imprint control region, while on the paternal allele the CTCF cannot bind. This causes the nearby enhancer to promote expression of Igf2 on the paternal allele, but H19 on the maternal allele.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumor the imprint control region is methylated on the maternal allele, causing Igf2 to also be expressed from the maternal allele and no H19 to be expressed. Igf2 is growth promoting so this causes a tumor to grow in a child's kidneys.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This means it causes DNA to be<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>hypomethylated (e.g. having less methylation). It does this by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. </span></p>
<p><span>The main mechanism for this type of pre-cancer cell must be the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. By causing the CpG islands to be unmethylated they can be expressed again. This will allow the problem cells to be killed off thus thwarting the leukemia before it starts.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable therefore it can have affects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. Once changes are made to a cell they will passed onto daughter cells. This is accomplished by DNMT1, which add methyl groups to hemi-methylated DNA in the daughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span>There are 2 times in the lifetime of a person when they undergo sensitive periods. A sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming (e.g. the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks) These 2 periods are (1) pre-implantation and early development of an embryo and (2) germ cell development (e.g. creation of oocytes and sperm cells).</span></p>
<p><span>The epigenetic reprograming that occurs during this time is necessary for the successful survival of an embryo. Using drugs that can inhibit DNA methylation at this time would cause portions of the genome that are meant to be methylated to not be methylated (i.e. imprinted regions and repetitive elements). This could cause diseases other than the ones that you are trying to treat to occur in the resulting embryo.</span></p></div>
