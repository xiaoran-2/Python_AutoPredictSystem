    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In sites rich in dinucleotides CG are methylated by methyltransferases for its stability base pairing on the antiparallel chain, although CpG island are not normaly methylated. DNA methylation at intergenic sequences and repetitive elements occurs to give stability and integrity to a gene. At intergetic regions is for silencing transcription in the oposite direction of a gene to guarantee the correct transcription  of the gene of  interest; At repetitive elements DNA methylation occurs to prevent transposition or overexpression of other genes. Cytosine methylation itself is mutagenic, as metC can be easily converted to T.</p>
<p>In Cancer and disease methylation at CpG islands can occur in tumor repressor genese there for silencing genes that must be active and that stops cancer development, in the case of intergenic regions if no methylation is present then overlapping of DNA polymerase can occur leaving expression of a gene(s) incomplete and for repetitive elements in cancer if no methylation occur, then repetitive elements would transpose and produce a mutation in the gene to where it transposed, as well as for the genes next to the repetitive element that would express uncontrollably, in example in cancer making the cell immortal by overexpression of growth factors, or silencing of apoptotic markers; in disease, over methylation, or lack of it can disrupt the expression of a protein or enzyme giving rise to a variety of disorders. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR of the maternal allele is not methylated so the insulator CTCF is on the ICR preventing the action of enhancers on the Igf2 gene and its expression, while allowing the transcription of long non-coding RNA H19 and the action of enhancers in ti. On the other hand the paternal allele of ICR is methylated preventing the union with CTCF thus the enhancers are free to act upon Igf2 allowing its expression, so the maternal allele expreses H19 while the paternal allele expresses Igf2. Disruption of imprinting can lead to overexperession of a gene as the gene would be expressed bye two alleles instead of one. In cancer this imprinting could ultimatly happen in an oncogene, if no imprinting occur there will be expression of the oncogene, and allow cancer generation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a epigenetic inhibitor that stops the activity of methyltranferases, thus decreasing the rate of DNA methylation; it has been shown that in some types of cancer, DNA methylation is increased, this event coud repress the expression of tumor supressor genes thus giving the oportunitiy to a cell to proliferate and mutate uncontrollably. Decitabine could then decrease the methylation rate in the cells allowing the expression of the tumor repressor genes and restablish the normal cell cycle, thus giving a window of opportunity for treatment of tumor. Although a prolonged therapy can cause modifications at germinal epigenetic level, or expression of otherwise silenced genes in new cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes such as methylations or acethylations last trouhghout cell generations passing down the paternal DNA string, and the daughter string aquiring the epigenetic marks that paternal once had. During sensitive periods, namely a period of time in wich DNA is demethylated to aquire a new methylation profile like during primordial germ cell development or/and early development; treatment by epigenetic drugs can alter the epigenetic marks on DNA by activating both alleles of a gene thus causing overexpression, imprinting marks would not be adquired, and even inactivation of the X-chromosome could fail.</p></div>
