<p>DNA methylation affects the genome in different ways and may cause cancer, due to different reasons. Some of the mechanisms are the following:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">CpGs and DNA methylation  </span></strong></p>
<p>CpGs (cytosines connected to guanines) are clustered into CpG islands (CGIs), often at promoter genes. CGIs are usually unmethylated, so that genes can be expressed.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an inactive epigenetic mark -- it silences gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mainly studied in mammals for the inactive X chromosome; it occurs at CpG dinucleotides, and is mainly mitotically heritable, due to features of DNMT1 –- a methyltransferase, essential for viability, as DNMT1 knockouts die in utero. DNMT1 can be removed passively, or actively.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Disease and cancer</span></p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation, including genome-wide hypomethylation, and regional hypermethylation result in genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specificity, and of imprinted genes, lead to disease. If, additionally, tumour suppressor genes are also silenced by the CGIs promoter hypermethylation<em>,</em> cancer may result.   </p>
<p>Unusually high frequency of hypermethylation in CpG rich sites called CGI methylator phenotype (CIMP) can be used to diagnose cancer, to classify different types and sub-types of tumour.</p>
<p>Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is the hypermethylation of CGI shores, which has been detected in different tumours.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</span></strong></p>
<p>DNA is normally methylated in intergenic regions, and in repetitive elements, to maintain genomic integrity in both.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, DNMT1 is there to avoid <strong>genomic instability</strong>-- gene deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions, or duplications -- which could cause cancer to follow.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in repetitive elements aims to silence repeats to prevent <strong>illegitimate combinations</strong> – like copy and paste, or cut and paste of a repeat in the genes --, which is clearly mutagenic, and cancer may ensue.</p>
<p>When<strong> intergenic regions or repetitive elements are</strong> <strong>unmethylated</strong>, cancer may result. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics -- whereby genes are switched on and off by methylation or acetylation, pass on mutations to the next generations during cell division (including methylations that cause oncongenic mutations), until they are erased.</p>
<p><strong>Decitabine</strong> pertains to <strong>DNMTi epigenetic drugs</strong>--, <strong>inhibiting DNA Methyltransferases</strong>. Decitabine is FDA (US) approved for the treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) that progresses to AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia), both hematopoeitic (blood) malignancies.</p>
<p>Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, bind the nucleotides to copy methylation to consecutive daughter strands, so DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly, and can no longer be released. Because cancer cells replicate much quicker than other cells, it is quite effective on MDS.  </p>
<p>Given at very low dosage, <strong>Decitabine increases DNA demethylation</strong>, so having <strong>maximum anti-neoplastic effect</strong> (killing tumour cells) at MDS.</p>
<p>Scientists do not know how specific decitabine is --, it probably impacts all dividing cells, but as cancer cells divide quicker, it has bigger impact there. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is associated with DNA methylation at the imprint control regions (ICRs). Methylation in ICRs is associated with expression of a paternal, or maternal gene, which needs to be methylated to be expressed.</p>
<p>A very common characteristic of cancer cells is displaying loss of imprinting. Genes that should be displaying monoallelic, parent-of-origin specific expression, no longer show this, but rather become <strong>expressed, or silenced, from both parental alleles</strong>. The reason this is found in cancer is probably because many imprinted genes are involved in growth --, they are either growth promoting, or growth suppressing. So hypermethylation, or hypomethylation can both be found in cancer.</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>H19/Igf2 cluster</strong> expression, <strong>normally</strong>, the<strong> ICR is</strong> <strong>methylated</strong> <strong>in the paternal allele</strong> therefore silencing the expression of H19, and allowing the expression of Igf2 paternally, whereas<strong> in the maternal allele ICR is unmethylated</strong>, and bounded by CTCF (an insulator protein), therefore allowing expression of H19, and silencing the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>Wilm's tumour, both the paternal and the maternal allele express Igf2</strong>, a growth promoting gene, so that it is expressed twice. This double expression contributes to disease, including tumours in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation changes switch genes on or off, and impact on the expression or silencing of specific genes, causing a sustained epigenetic alteration through mitotic heritability -- e<strong>pigenetic mutations which pass on to daughter cells in consecutive generations, unless erased, so they last beyond drug treatment</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drugs should be avoided in <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2 sensitive periods of developmen</strong>t<strong>, </strong></span> <strong>Primordial Germ-cell Development up to the Production of Mature Eggs and Sperms; and Pre-implantation and Early Post-implantation Period</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main reasons epigenetic drugs should not be given to patients during the aforementioned periods are because an active reprogramming is happening –- removal, and laying down (establishment phase rather than maintenance) of epigenetic marks at different places in the genome, a very sensitive time; and there is an unpredictable impact on patients, as different types of cells could be affected in unforeseeable ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These periods seem most sensitive to changes in the environment, like changes in diet, specific vitamins as methyl donors, phytoestrogens, endocrine disruptors, smoking, pollution, metals, and chemicals, etc.  Furthermore, when administering epigenetic drugs to tumours, the older the patient the better, as in older patients cell division is slower, and epigenetic mutations will impact in quicker dividing cells (tumours).</p>
