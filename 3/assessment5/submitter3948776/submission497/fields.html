    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome of a normal cell, contains groups or islands of Cytosine-Guanine dinucleotides, bonded by a phosphate component (CpG).  These CpG islands are found in the majority of promoters of gene expression and are typically unmethylated.  The genome itself contains a great deal of redundant, or repetitive DNA, known as long terminal repeats (LTR's), or satellite repeats.  These repeats can number into the thousands and they tend to be methylated, their expression, therefore suppressed.  It is believed that transcriptional noise, as well as antisense transcription is inhibited by methylation of these regions.</p>
<p>When this pattern of methylation is disturbed, the expression of the genes is changed.  When CpG islands are methylated, the expression of the associated gene is inhibited.  If the affected gene is responsible for the production of tumor suppressor factors, regulation of apoptosis (cellular death), or leads to the production of factors involved in DNA repair, then this would in turn, lead to increased growth, cellular longevity and genomic instability, as seen in cancerous cells.</p>
<p>Cancerous cells also exhibit targeted hypomethylation, at LTR's and intergenic regions, thus leading to increased expression, of the associated genes.  Intergenic regions have also been shown to express factors that are associated with chromatin remodelling, increasing or decreasing the availablity of the genome, to the transcription machinery.  This would lead to alterations in the expression of proteins and other factors, involved in the production and maintenance of cells and increased production of tissue, as in cancer and other diseases involving tissue overgrowth.  If the affected genes coded for enzymes or other functional compounds, this would lead to a shift in homeostasis, most likely resulting in the presentation of other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a new drug, approved for the treatment of certain myelodysplastic diseases.  Decitabine is classed as a Nucleoside Analogue and more specifically, a DNA Methyltranferase Inhibitor, or DNA Methylation Inhibitor.</p>
<p>DNMT is an enzyme responsibe for methylating DNA after mitosis, ensuring that methylation marks are reproduced in the daughter cells.  Decitabine works by inhibiting the actions of DNMT, thus reducing or removing methylation marks over time.</p>
<p>If Decitabine is taken up, by rapidly dividing, neoplastic, or tumour cells, it would cause DNMT to be bound and prevent it from going on to methylate more DNA.  If the promoters or control regions, of genes responsible for regulation of growth (tumour supressor genes), were affected by this process, then they would resume expression and one would expect to see improved regulation of cell proliferation.  The result would be a reduction in tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In imprinted genes, there is mono-allelic expression.  A disruption in the imprinting is caused by changes to the Imprint Control Region (ICR), leading to either expression or silencing of both alleles.</p>
<p>In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal ICR is methylated and the maternal ICR is not.  The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele, bonds with a protein known as CTCF, an insulator factor.  This insulates the Igf2 gene from enhancers (factors that promote expression), thus inhibiting expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>The paternal ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster, is methylated and CTCF cannot bond with it.  This allows Igf2 to be accessed by the enhancers, resulting in unimpeded expression of Igf2, from the paternal allele, as would occur in normal cells.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoter (oncogene) and it's over expression is associated with disease.  In a Wilm's tumour, the imprinting of the maternal allele is disrupted with methylation of the ICR and the promoter of the H19 gene.  This silences H19 expression and more importantly, increases Igf2 expression.  This over expression of Igf2, is also involved in other diseases, such as Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, when there are disturbances in other imprinted regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation affects the accessibility of the genes and therefore their expression.  Methylation marks are reproduced in daughter cells by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA Methyltransferase, thus methylation patterns are heritable.  Methylation is also a mutagenic process and there is a higher likelihood that a methylated Cytosine, will mutate into Thyamine, to become a stable mutation to the genome.</p>
<p>There are several periods of development in the mammalian life cycle that should be considered sensitive.   During these times, the epigenome is being cleared and reprogrammed and any pressures on the mechanisms involved, are likely to cause alterations.  These periods are in early development, so shortly after fertilisation, through to the epiblast stage, then as the primordial germ cells are developing and also when the gametes are maturing, around the time of conception.</p>
<p>Drug therapy during sensitive periods should be avoided.  The drugs are unable to target specific loci, so their effects would be widespread, unpredictable and highly mutagenic.  Any such interference with the epigenome, during these periods, would most likely lead to increased presentation of disease or even morbidity.</p></div>
