    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to contribute to the timley and correct expression of genes, methylation is generally associated with the silencing of genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer as the methylation at some CpG islands become more dense. The methylation patterns vary between different types of cancer. In a normal cell the CpG islands will generally be hypomethylated, but the intergenic region and the repetitive elements will be methylated. The opposite is found in cancer cells; with methylation at CpG islands and no methylation in the <span>intergenic region and the repetitive elements. This contributes to disease progression as methylation at CpG islands in cancer cells acts to silence different tumor suppressor genes. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and the silencing of tumor suppressor genes may function as an advantage (increased growth/survival) these cells are selected for over their normal neighboring cells. </span></p>
<p><span>The <span>normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally to contribute to genomic stability in healthy cells, where these regions will be methylated and this contribute to the formation of densely packed heterochromatin. In cancer cells, with general genome wide hypomethylation <span>in intergenic regions and repetitive elements the genome is less stable and we find more open euchromatin. This </span></span></span>contributes to the development of cancer as it causes illegitimate recombination of repeates, activation of repeats, transpositions and cryptic promoters. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), and this blocks binding of the CTCF and methylation is spread to CpG islands in the H19 promotor. This methylation causes silencing of the long noncoding RNA H19, while at the same time allowing for downstream enhancers to cause expression of Ig2f.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, CTCF can bind and the H19 promotor is not methylated and thus not silenced. In this way CTCF function as a insulator protein by insulating the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, which instead enhance the expression of H19. Thus, Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele. </p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is lost in Wilm's tumor, causing both alleles to act as the paternal allele. This contributes to cancer as more Igf2 is expressed, and Igf2 is a oncogene that promotes cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It inhibits methylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor promotors, thus inhibiting the silencing of tumor suppressors associated with cancer. As it allows for the continued expression of tumor suppressor proteins, it has an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It can remove methylation at CpG islands, and as methylation is mitotically inheritable it can have an enduring effect on the epigenome. A sensitive periode is a periode in which reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs, such as during gametogenisis and after fertilization. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during such periods would be inadvisable as these drugs could interfere with the normal development of epigenetic marks, this could cause severe birth defects. </p></div>
