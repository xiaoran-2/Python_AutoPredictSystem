    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG dinucleotides are susceptible to modification through methylation of the C5 of the cytosine. CpG islands (CGI) are dense CpG accumulation and usually found in genes promoters. CGI are found in around 60% of the gene promoters and it tend to be unmethylated regardless the activity status of gene. However, if methylated, the genes become inactive. CGI methylation is one of the repressive epigenetic marks that found in the heterochromatin. Hypermethylation of CGI is commonly described in many cancers. This aberrant epigenetic modification leads to downregulation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. CIMP (CpG islands methylation phenotype) in cancer is associated with many clinicopathological manifestations which allow its use in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.</p>
<p>Beside CGIs, CpG dinucleotides are also found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in less density and represent the majority of the CpGs found in our genome. At these regions, CpG tend to be methylated in normal cells. Methylation of the CpG at these regions is associated by genomic stability by silencing of repetitive elements proteins, cryptic start sites and cryptic splice sites. In Cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation is observed. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is associated with genomic instability. Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transposition and repeats and activation of cryptic promoters are the main consequences of this aberrant epigenetic modification. Abnormal karyotypes (like insertion, deletion, duplication or translocation) found in many cancer cells are related to the hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Desregulation of imprinted genes are also found in cancer cells which caused by aberrant methylation status of the differentially methylated regions (DMR) of the genome. Hypomethylation in cancer is progressive with tumorigenicity and its degree may determined the stage of the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is a cluster of genes controlled by ICR in the middle of the cluster. This ICR are differentially methylated depending on the parent of origin. The paternally inherited allele of this cluster is methylated at the ICR. This methylation prevent the binding of blocking protein called CTCF to the ICR making the way clear to the distant enhancers to activate the expression of Igf2, its primary preference, rather than H19, its secondary preference. Moreover, the methylation at this ICR spread to the promoter of the H19 gene which exerts another effort to block its expression. However, the maternally inherited allele is unmethylated at the ICR. In this case, the CTCF blocking protein is able to bind to the ICR which block the enhancer effect on the Igf2 gene and enhance the expression of the H19 gene only.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is one of the common and early events of tumorigenesis. In Wilm’s tumor, both alleles of H19/Igf2 cluster are methylated (like the paternal allele) at the ICR which lead to overexpression of Igf2 and downregulation of H19 gene. Doubling the dose of Igf2, growth promoting oncogene, is one of the mechanisms that leads to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine was initially designed as nucleoside analogues which lead to DNA damage and cytotoxicity at high doses. Decitabine is now used as a hypomethylating agent that is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabine inhabits the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) which are responsible for laying down methylation marks during mitotic division or epigenetic reprogramming. Such inhibition leads to reversal of promoter DNA hypermethylation in low doses or to destructive global hypomethylation in higher doses. Tumor cells are actively dividing cells. Inhibition of DNMT in such cells will result in inefficient methylation of the daughter cells that lead to cellular death or retaining the activity of tumorsupressor genes which were methylated at their promotors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is described as stable epigenetic mark. The main reason behind this is due to mitotic heritability of DNA methylation marks which allow the transfer of these marks to the daughter cells and so on.  For this reason, drugs that modulate DNA methylation status (like hypomethylating agents) have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>However, reprogramming (resetting) of the DNA methylation marks happens twice during the development, after fertilization and during gametogenesis. These periods are considered sensitive periods in term of epigenetics in which any epigenetic alteration may be disastrous. These periods involve removal of methylation marks then marks reestablished again. The reestablishment of epigenetic marks is dependent on DNMT which targeted by hypomethylating agents like decitabine. Using such agents during sensitive periods is associated with genetic abnormalities, due to genomic instability, that may lead to fetal death or genetic diseases like cancer.</p></div>
