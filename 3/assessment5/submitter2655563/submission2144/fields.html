    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence the expression of the neighbouring gene. </p>
<p>DNA methylation is disrupted in cancer by disruption (mutation etc.) of epigenetic machinery so that it is unable to perform its normal function. CpG islands become hypermethylated. Also there is genomewide hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands (which are often at promoters) leads to silencing of gene expression, some of which may be oncogenes, some may promote growth and yet others may be tumour suppressor genes. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps preventing genomic instability by suppressing hidden transcription start sites or splice (break &amp; rejoin) sites. If occurring at repetitive elements,it also leads to genomic instability due to unnecessary, illegitimate pairing of CpG islands, thus causing translocations, transpositions. recombinations etc.</p>
<p>In the intergenic regions, there are certain silent sites that can lead to start of transcription. Yet others are silent splice sites. Lack of methylation here leads to genomic instability contributing to disease.</p>
<p>In cancers, there is hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements and this leads to genomic instability.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can lead to expression of the gene in both the maternal and paternal copy. For example, H19 is expressed from the maternal copy only (not methylated) as it is imprinted in the paternal copy. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal copy only (methylated) as it is imprinted in the maternal copy. Due to disruption of imprinting, Igf2 gets expressed in both the copies &amp; H19 does not get expressed at all. Igf2 is growth promoter &amp; H19 is growth suppressor. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease due to unopposed action of excess Igf2 leading to Wilms tumor in the child.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It is expected to decrease the excessive methylation found at the CpG islands (CpG island hypermethylation), some of which are promoters. Since CpG island hypermethylation is a feature of tumors, reversing it by using Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation (as most probably induced by Dr Stephen Baylin’s trial) potentially alters the expression of some gene(s) which change the malignant cells in such a way as to become more responsive to the action of chemotherapeutic agents used subsequently. Moreover alteration of the expression of some gene(s) could change some component of the epigenomic machinery in such a way that the methylation seen earlier is no longer possible. This can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods in the ‘cycle of life’ when epigenetic reprogramming occurs and it is important to have safe environment around these periods so that the epigenetic reprogramming is not disrupted. These periods are embryonic stage to gastrulation (development of primordial germ cells) and the period of gametogenesis in younger persons.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as this would interfere with epigenetic reprogramming occurring during their gametogenesis.</p></div>
