    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are frequently found in promoters and they are usually free of methylation. When they are methylated, it is associated with silencing for two possible reasons, firstly, methylated CGIs are associated with the formation of a repressive structure in chromatin and second, because they might avoid the transcription factors union to the promoter. Conversely, in cancer cells the CGIs tend to be hypermethylated and then silencing genes such as tumor suppressor genes. The identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies depending of the tumor type, some examples of CGIs that become hypermethylated in cancer had been described for instance BRCA1 in breast cancer. The gene BRCA1 is a caretaker gene that encodes a protein important for DNA repairing and acts as a tumor suppressor, then the lack of its expression predispose to cancer. In the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated because their function is structural and silencing is needed to prevent transpositions, illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference. However, in cancer these regions become hypomethylated and the effect is genomic instability since it can occur illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transposition and disruption to neighboring genes. E.g. hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in the activation of genes like miR21 which targets a tumor suppressor observed in glioma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is under the control of an imprint control region (ICR) which binds the protein CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers. In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and CTCF can bind to it, then the enhancers don’t have effect on Igf2 gene and it is not expressed, instead H19 gene is expressed. In the other hand, in the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers have access to Igf2 and it is expressed.  In the case of Wilm’s tumor, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted, the ICRs are hypermethylated and both alleles act as the paternal. There is an increased expression of Igf2 which is an oncogene since it is a growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a kind of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) that it has been already FDA approved. The DNMTi are nucleoside analogues that bind irreversibly to DNMTs when they are incorporated to the DNA, it means replication dependent.  At low doses, the effect is favorable causing DNA demethylation, however, at high doses the effect is nonspecific or toxic. Despite of the lack of specificity, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because in some types of cancer the effect can be hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes and this drug might target these cells although the mechanism is still unclear.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects because epigenetic changes are lost during cell division to the subsequent daughter cells until they are entirely erased. So, drugs that alter DNA methylation indeed can have effects that last beyond the period of treatment and it is an advantage versus other agents. However it is important to avoid these treatments during some periods especially during embryonic development and in children between 9 to 12 years because these are some sensitive periods where the epigenetic marks are removed and reprogrammed. During these sensitive periods environmental signal affect the structure and function of the genome. In the case of young patients, in view of the fact of these sensitive periods, effects on germ cells need to be considered.</p></div>
