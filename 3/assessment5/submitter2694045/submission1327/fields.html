    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to halt the transcription of the genes it precedes. In cancer the CpG islands are hyper methylated, especially those followed by tumor suppressors thereby the cell does not suppress the growth and cell division, which is not the same case for normal cells. We can also witness hypo methylation on those CpG islands in cancer cells promoting Oncogenes, genes that can make cells divide uncontrollably. Normally intragenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell because of their instability if found as Euchromatin. Repetitive elements if not methylated can cause recombination, insertions and/or deletions that may directly harm genes responsible for cell division and cell growth, and this is what happens in most of the cases in Cancer : Repetitive elements become Hypo methylated thereby causing deletions, insertions, or recombination. So to summarize, in Cancer CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, while intragenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This knowledge can contribute greatly to our treatment of Cancer, since for some kinds of Cancers we can target Methylation to hinder the progress of Cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMT is responsible for keeping DNA methylations through the replicated DNA strand. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. Decitabine inhibits the DNA methylation from occurring in the DNA strand replicated because of its inhibition of DNMT. Since most of cancer cells have hyper methylated CpG islands preceding Tumor suppressors and causes the cell to divide uncontrollably, Decitabine decreases this methylation when it inhibits DNMT, therefore causing Tumor suppressors genes to be active again and take control of the cell division. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we have studied in examples such as the Dutch famine and Overkalix, the conditions that the human experiences during pre-implantations and germ cell developments removes all methylations in the Genomes; there are periods of Epigenetic reprogramming and that's why they are sensitive periods. The sensitive period is one of the most important periods in the Human development since it's during these periods nuture plays a role in modifying epigenetics that can have effects on later generations. Anyways, let's say the drugs were targeting DNA hyper-methylations on CpG Islands. If those drugs successfully decreases this methylation, then (since methylations is mitotically heritable) this demethylation will be transfered to the next generation thereby lasting long enough after drug treatment. Treating pateints during the Sensitive periods may have effects on their Offspring and this what events like Dutch Famine and Overkalix may show. so patients are not supposed to be advised to take the drugs during pregnancy(pre-implantation) or their teens (since this is the period of germcell development) </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Methylation of the parental allele imprint control region causes Igf2 to be expressed rather than H19. Igf2 promotes growth. In the maternal imprinting control region there is no methylations thereby Igf2 is not activated, and the enhancers act to promote H19. This is what happens in a normal cell. Only one Igf2 is functional. In a diseased cell we can witness either both of the alleles methylated or both of them not methylated. When both of the Alleles are methylated this is a condition of Wilm's tumor. When both of the alleles are methylated, Igf2 is expressed abundantly, while H19 decreased thereby causing increased growth.</p></div>
