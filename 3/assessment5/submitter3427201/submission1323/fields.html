    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation plays an important role in normal biologic processes, distinct and abnormal patterns of methylation are observed in cancers. DNA methylation may represent an early and fundamental step in the pathway by which normal tissue undergoes neoplastic transformation. These mechanisms may play a critical role in precipitating the development of a large and diverse number of human cancers. DNA methylation is an important factor in the development of cancer. The expression of genetic information within an individual cell shows how that cell subsequently functions. The inheritance of information on the basis of gene expression rather than base sequence is termed epigenetics. The methylation of DNA is recognized as a key mechanism in the regulation of gene expression in this way, and evidence for its role in the development of a wide variety of cancers is accumulating. Altered methylation patterns are known to occur in the DNA of cancer cells. Two patterns have been observed: wide areas of global hypomethylation along the genome, and localized areas of hypermethylation at certain specific sites, the CpG islands, within the gene promoter regions. In fundamental genetic models of cancer, the amplification of protooncogenes, or the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, disrupts the balance that normally controls cell proliferation and drives it through the succession of events leading to full malignant status. Abnormal methylation patterns can also indirectly affect gene activity with the disruption of the transcription–translation process by increasing the probability for a mutational event to take place and reducing overall chromosomal stability, resulting in the manufacture of a dysfunctional protein product. In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.  Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.The other regions of the gene in where you find DNA methylation and where they tend to be methylated are intergenic intervals and the repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19-IGF2 has been implicated in a variety of disorders and cancer pre-disposition. Although IGF2 role in human cancers is relatively well established, recent data have revealed a critical role for H19 RNA in the process of tumorigenicity. H19 functions as a stress modulator, induced by hypoxia, and a survival factor being involved in several fundamental processes of tumorigenesis. Genomic imprinting of the IGF2 and H19 genes has been shown to play a role in the regulation of the IGF2 and H19 expressions during embryonic development and in cancer. Over-expressions of H19 and IGF2 genes in many tumors may or may not be associated with loss of imprinting. H19 is emerging as one of the key players in cancer biology. Mechanisms can potentially result in IGF2 over-expression in cancer, including, loss of imprinting (LOI) of the maternal allele, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with paternal duplication, amplification of the IGF2 gene and abnormally activated signaling pathway leading to transcriptional up-regulation of the active alleles.There is increasing evidence for chromosomal domains containing multiple imprinted genes and for domain-wide disruption of imprinting in certain diseases. In a majority of Wilms' tumors (WTs) there is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19, IGF2 and KIP2, clustered on chromosome 11p15.5.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth.  When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.  One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic gene regulation, involving posttranslational histone modifications and DNA methylation, is a process particularly sensitive to environmental cues during development. Animal studies have shown that maternal exposure to drugs, stress, and endocrine disruptors during pregnancy can alter epigenetic gene programming in the brain and contribute to neurodevelopmental deficits in offspring. Several studies have linked gestational or neonatal epigenetic drugs exposure to long-lasting changes in DNA methylation and altered gene expression in nonneuronal tissues. The term, sensitive period is a developmental term and refers to a time when a person is particularly receptive to certain kinds of environmental experiences. Individual development proceeds from the formation of germ cells (sperm and egg) through fertilization, embryonic and fetal development (both of which take place during pregnancy), infancy, early childhood, and adolescence. These broad developmental stages may create sensitivity. Damage from environmental exposures may occur and manifest itself immediately or may not appear until subsequent stages of devel­opment or after development is complete. It is the reason why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
