    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one mechanism through which cells silence gene expression. Typically CpG islands are left unmethylated, and are often found in the promoters of active genes. Because these promoters are unmethylated, transcription is able to occur and the gene is active. In cancer cells it has been found that many of these CpG islands are hypermethylated, thus silencing genes that would normally be active. Often in cancer it is found that the CpG islands in the promoters of tumour supressor genes are hypermethylated, and consequently, inappropriately silenced. This can lead to inappropriate growth, and cell division as the cell may stop responding to external signals that would normally control these processes. One example of this is the BRCA1 gene, well known for its role in breast cancer. Hypermethylation, and therefore silencing of the CpG islands in the BRCA1 promoter can lead to uncontrolled cell division and genome instability. As opposed to the normally unmethylated state of the CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually found to be methylated, keeping them inactive, thus maintaining genomic stability. The methylation of these regions prevents inappropriate recombination, transposition of repetive elements and translocations of chromosomes.  Evidence suggests that these regions are hypomethylated in cancer cells. This can lead to widespread genomic instability as these repeats become active and may start jumping to other regions of the genome. Depending on where the element inserts it could lead to gene silencing, if it falls in a coding region, or gene activation, if a nearby gene falls under control of its promoter. Activation of a cryptic promoter alone, via DNA demethylation, can also cause nearby genes to become inappropiately expressed. If an oncogene becomes activated due to one of these mechanisms it could lead to uncontrolled cell division and potentially cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated. This methylation blocks the binding of the protein CTCF, which is an insulator protein. The lack of insulator allows the methylation to spread to the nearby H19 promoter, causing the silencing of H19 and the nearby activators to act of the Igf2 locus instead. This results in increased expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind. This insulator protein prevents the downstream activators from working on Igf2 and the result is increased expression of H19. In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting due to the hypermethylation of the ICR. In this case both alleles act like the paternal allele, resulting in an overexpression of Igf2. Because Igf2 is an oncogene, overexpression can result in inappropriate cell growth, and could lead to cancer. Also associated with this cluster is the Cdkn1c gene, which is a tumour supressor. When the region around the  ICR is methylated, as in the paternal allele. the  Cdkn1c gene is also methylated and thereby silenced, leading to the loss of function of this cell cycle regulator.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of epigentic inhibitors. DNMTi's inhibit DNA methylation as they are analogues of nucleosides, which, when incorporated into the DNA in the place of the normal nucleoside, will irreversibly bind the DNMT, thus making it unavailable to transfer methyl groups onto the DNA. Because Decitabine is replication dependent, it will have an impact on cancer cells, which are actively dividing. The purpose of Decitabine is to reduce the methylation of DNA. This can be effective in treating tumours that are associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands. With the function of the DNMT impaired, the cell will not be able to methylate as many of the CpG islands as before. This could lead to the reactivation of genes that were inappropriately silenced and the restoration of the function of certain tumour supressor genes, allowing the body to regain control of cel division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. Thus changes to methylation of the DNA in one cell can lead to changes of the DNA methylation of its daughter cells and all subsequent cells of that lineage. This is significant in cancer cells, which are rapidly dividing,  although could also affect normal body cells as they too will divide at some point. DNA methylation is also related to histone modification and other layers of epigenetic regulation and so can have significant and long lasting effects of gene expression. Sensitive periods refer to the times during development during which the epigenome is being reset and reprogrammed. These periods include early embryonic development, primordial germ cell development and gametogenesis. It is inadvisable to treat patients during these periods as important epigenetic marks are being laid down at this time. This includes imprinting of certain genes whose expression is parent of origin specific, as well as methylating intergenic regions and repeats which allows for genome stability. Epigenetic regulation is also crucial in cellular differentiation as it determines which genes are active in the various cell types. Treating young patients could effect the epigenome of their gametes, which could have lasting catastrophic effects on any future offspring.</p></div>
