    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands typically works to silence genes. In a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. The opposite tends to be true of cancer cells: CpG islands are hypermethylated but intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Indeed, cancer cells exhibit genome-wide hypomethylation relative to normal cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands can result in inappropriate gene silencing. For example, the silencing of tumor suppressor genes will turn those genes off, so that tumor suppression will be weakened or not occur.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps prevent transcription from occurring where it should not otherwise occur, and thereby reduces potential harmful effects of random DNA transcription, like uncontrolled cell growth. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated so those areas of the gene are more likely to be expressed when they should not be, possibly giving rise to uncontrolled cell growth or other abnormalities associated with cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repeats or intergenic regions can also contribute to disease by causing genomic instability, including illegitimate recombination between repeats, the activation of repeats, inappropriate insertions or deletions, translocation of genes, or the disruption of neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so alterations in DNA methylation can be passed on to daughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur at various stages of development, when the epigenome is being reset. During these periods it is possible to disrupt the normal epigenetic reprogramming. There are two major stages of epigenetic reprogramming: pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development (PGCD).</p>
<p>Since PGCD in humans continues throughout early life into puberty, it is probably wise to avoid treating young patients with drugs that alter the epigenome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue which means it is incorporated into DNA. Drugs like decitabine cause demethylation of DNA by irreversibly binding methyltransferase (an enzyme required for DNA methylation) so that it is no longer released. The action of decitabine is division dependent, therefore cancer cells, which divide a lot more than normal cells, will be more highly affected.</p>
<p>This type of treatment has been shown to slow the growth of tumors and also seem to make tumors more treatable with chemotherapeutic drugs.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated (imprinted) at the H19/Igf2 cluster, while the maternal allele is unmethylated. In the case of imprinted genes, methylation does not equate to silencing. When the unmethylated maternal allele is bound by the insulator protein CTCF, Igf2 is insulated from downstream promoters, which in turn enhances the expression of H19 on the maternal allele. However, since the paternal allele is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote its expression. Therefore, Igf2 is paternally expressed.</p>
<p>Disruptions of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can be caused by mutations or deletions that cause a loss of imprinting so that the maternal allele acts like the paternal allele; uniparental disomy as in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome; and (rarely) epigenetic loss of imprinting. With this type of disruption, Igf2 can be upregulated. Igf2 is a growth promoter, so upregulation of Igf2 would lead to excessive growth.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is a childhood tumor of the kidney associated with upregulation of Igf2 due to loss of imprinted that would normally control growth. Loss of imprinting is common in cancer.</p>
