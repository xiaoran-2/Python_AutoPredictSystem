    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands methylation status regulates gene expression: methylation of DNA in promotor regions turn off gene expression and vice versa unmethylated promotors activate expression. Methylation is inherited which is important for maintenance of a particular gene expression set. </p>
<p>There are two patterns of DNA methylation disruption in cancer. The first pattern is genome-wide hypomethylation which is mostly occurred at CpG islands of intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements. Mentioned regions are usually methylated in normal cells and become hypomethylated in cancer cell. The second pattern is hypermethylation of promotors which are normally unmethylated. These phenomena is called reciprocal methylation.</p>
<p>Role of methylation is similar to effects of mutation. Hypermethylation of promotors of tumor suppressor genes causes their inactivation, hypomethylation of promotors of oncogenes causes their activation.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are silenced by DNA methylation. Methylation of intergenic regions is necessary for stabilization of DNA structure.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in genome instability. It may lead to chromosome mutations and activation/suppression of different genes. Active repetitive elements disrupt expression of neighbor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA hypomethylation agent. It inhibits activity of DNA methyltransferase which is necessary for CpG islands methylation.</p>
<p>As know, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promotor is common in cancer. Methylation marks are maintaned through cell proliferation by repetitive methylation of newly synthesed DNA strand. Inactivation of DNA methyltransferase means that newly synthesed DNA have no methylation marks and alleles of tumor suppressors located on this strand become active. Active tumor suppressors transform cancer cell in normal or they make cell die in case irreparable changes (apoptosis).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inherited through cell divisions. Therefore DNA methylation patterns in cancer cells altered by epigenetic drugs will remain the same in their descendants after end of drug treatment. Common aim of epigenetic drugs is re-activation of tumor suppressors by erasing methylation of their promotors. If some of these tumor suppressors become active they remain active and they increase cancer susceptibility for usual drugs.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is a period of time when cell (epigenome or any other system) is more susceptible to external influences from the outside than in other periods of time.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development: epigenetic reprogramming in early development from blastocyst to epiblast and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients  during sensitive periods may alter epigenetic reprogramming in abnormal way.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 promoter of paternal allele is methylated which silence H19 expression and upregulate Igf2 expression. It is a negatiev feedback loop:  H19 expression stop expression of enchancers which upregulate Igf2.</p>
<p> Maternal allele contains unmethylated H19 promotor which means its active expression and downregulation of Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of both alleles causes ccomplete silencing of H19 expression and  double expression of Igf2 which is an oncogene.</p></div>
