    <h1>Submission 500 from Anon (session_user_id: b743c778a00856f9dff85590c743607d06cf5238)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  It covalently bonds with DNMT which permanently inactivates it.  Decitabine is incorporated into DNA during rapid growth in the S phase of the cell cycle.  With DNMT inactivated and bound, there is a passive loss of methylation in daughter cells.  Since tumor cells reproduce more rapidly than normal cells, this further enhances efficacy.  Because genes are not altered, just their expression, tumors created by hypermethylation of tumor-suppressor genes are vulnerable to reactivation of these genes.  DNMT inhibitors work best at low concentrations to reactivate genes which control basic cellular processes important in growth regulation such as apoptotic pathways, DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.   At high concentrations they are toxic to all cells.  Because they rely on a passive demethylation process, the effect is dependent upon cell replication.  Ref: DNMT inhibitors in Cancer Therapy (2013) Anticancer Res 33:2989-2996</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2/H19 cluster is an imprinted region where parental methylation patterns dictate which copy of the genes are expressed.  In the paternal copy, the imprint control region (ICR) and in the promoter region of H19 are both methylated.  The presence of methylation in the ICR allows expression of Igf2 which is a growth promoter.   In the maternal copy, the ICR is unmethylated; this allows the protein CTFC to bind to the ICR which in turn blocks expression of Igf2 and promotes expression of H19.  In Wilm’s tumor the methylation patterns are disrupted with loss of the maternal pattern and there is a hypermethylation which duplicates the paternal pattern on the second strand.  This results in a double dose of Ifg2 being expressed. Because Igf2 is a growth promoter, the result is an overgrowth of tissue which is an important step in tumor formation process.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands and adjacent regions called island shores, these areas are usually promoter regions and methylation functions to silence gene expression.  In cancer, there are 2 types of methylation disruption: 1) globally there is hypomethylation but, 2) locally there can be hypermethylation in promoter regions which silences important tumor suppressing genes.   Hypomethylation ranges from 20 to 60% reduction.  Reduction, mostly in intergenic and repetitive regions, contributes to genomic destabilization and translocations which can lead to tumor formation by placing promoter sequences adjacent to growth promoting genes.  Hypomethylation can also activate genes which have CpG poor promoter regions; this is not common but can occur with R-RAS in gastric cancer; another example is SNGC in breast and ovarian cancer.  Methylation of repetitive elements inactivates them and prevents them from randomly moving to other locations.  When methylation is reduced they activate and can disrupt normal expression or function of other important genes by inserting within an exon thereby disrupting production of normal proteins.  Hypermethylation can silence a variety of growth regulatory genes such as those controlling apoptosis or cell cycle; when inactivated, uncontrolled growth is permitted.  Hypermethylation can also inactivate DNA repair genes allowing a rapid accumulation of mutations that further abnormal growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During the lifetime of an individual the methylation pattern is maintained in somatic cells because methylation patterns are mitotically heritable.  Patterns are reset between generations by removing acquired methylation during specific development stages.  There are 2 sensitive periods in mammals when methylation patterns are being remodeled.  First the preimplantation period during embryonic development and again while primordial germ cells are developing into gametes.  During these periods methylation patterns are sensitive to environmental factors which influence methylation such as diet, nutrients, starvation, drugs, and maternal care.  During the development of germ cells to gametes, changes in methylation patterns become heritable between generations.  Treating patients with drugs that alter methylation patterns while germ cells are developing have the potential to pass the changes onto the next generation through the gametes.  This germ cell development period can be rather prolonged as eggs in humans are held in an immature state for years prior to final maturation.  If changes occur during the preimplantation stage, there could be significant alterations in subsequent development of tissues and organs.</p></div>
