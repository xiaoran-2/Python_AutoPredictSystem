    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA metylation at CpG islands ,whitch tends to be in the gene promoters, are helping with gene expresion regulation ( e.g tumor supresor genes). CpG inslands in normal cells are unually unmetylated on the contrary cells with cancer have numerously arrised metylation at CpG islands that starts early in desease developement , and  increases over time .Some CpG metylations can by chance occur in tumor supresor genes and make cell quickly grow and divide, increasing its life duration. This metylation changes in DNA are mitoticly heritable so all 'daughter' cells also have them. All this epimutations  makes that cancer cells eventually takes over. On the opposite normally DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are highly metylated. Supresing this DNA regions stabilizes genome (e.g less repetitive elements insertions, deletions). In cells with cancer DNA hypometylation start early and increases over time along with DNA hipermetylation at CpG islands. With this changes increases numer of DNA insertions of repetitive elements. When large regions of non homologues chromosomes have a lot of these repetitive elements, they must be meylated in these regions and densly packed otherwise they can bind together during mitoze and create reciprocal translocations. Also DNA transpositions like inserions and deletions happend more frequently. This genopyte diffrences couses interruptions with genes in the vicinity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabline belongs to a DNA demethylylating inhibitors. it makes DNA hypometylated  by restraining DNA methyltransferazse. Patiens with <span>myelodysplastic syndromes are being threated with this drug. It was shown that decitabine in form of  azacitidine used with histone-deacetylase inhibitor represed tumor developement in part of the patiens with lung cancer in late stages. Some patiens had surprisingly good response to standard chemoteraphy despite having hardly none response during medicine trial. Reason for this is that epigentetic state of cancer cells were altered, and make them more voulnerable for threatment.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sometimes mistakes in genes inprinting makes cell more susceptible for developing cancer for egzample H19/lgf2 cluster. In this framgent of DNA control region allele is imprinted on the paternal alleo. Enhancers from neibourhood are not block and can freely bind with the lgf2 and by doing so they promoting its expresion. Moreover DNA methylation from the imprinted region propagates downstram and supresing  H19 promoter. On the contrary in the maternal control region alleo is expresed, becouse of it the CTCF insulator protein can bind to this region. This blocks enhancers bindings with the lgf2. H19 is also expressed and it can ract with the enhancers. If  cell have two imprinted control region it couzes upregulation of the lgf2 oncogene which promotes cell grow. Carriers with this epigenetic mutation are more liky to have childhood tumors like Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration in DNA methylation are mitoticl heritable, so all the "doughter" cells have the same change in epigenome. Alteration in DNA metylation can make organism more susceptible for diabetes, obesity and some kinds of cancer. Sensitive are periods when changes in epigenetics marks happends in order to get suitable gene expresion  for cell function. The two most sensitive periods are pre-implantation in early developement and primorial germ cell developement, When this happends most of the epigenetics marks are wiped out from the DNA for the next generation pluripotent cells and then reestablished. In order to get healthy progeny human body must make as few mistakes as possible in epigenetics reprograming, so all the drugs thay may interfere wwith this proces are discouraged.</p></div>
