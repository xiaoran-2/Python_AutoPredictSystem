    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in two ways in cancer. On the one hand one can observe the hyper-methylation of CpG islands, on the other hand one can observe hypo-methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Since the level of DNA methylation is found to be linked inversely to the level of gene expression, this effect translates directly in the reduction of the expression of genes located in or preceeded by CpG-islands, and an increase in the expression of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>In normal cells the relatively low level of methylation of CpG islands allows for the expression of many functional genes, under which tumor and growth suppressors, whereas the relatively high level of methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions ensures a high level of genetic stability.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells however, an inversion of this pattern is found.  Generally a locus-specific hyper-methylation of CpG islands is found, whereas the genome on average seems to be hypo-methylated. Since the major part of the genome is thought to consist of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, this translates into a stronger expression of these.</p>
<p>This two-ways alteration of DNA methylation in cancer thus has two effects on the cells. Through the increased methylation of CpG islands, a reduced expression of tumor and growth suppressors is found, whereas through the reduced methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, an increased expression of these is found.</p>
<p>These have a multitude of effects towards genomic instability, such as a disruption in recombinatorical events (through the increase in possibilities of cross-over in repetitive elements) or the activation of transposons, which would insert themselves in functioning genes.</p>
<p>As such tumor inhibition is not just reduced, but tumor expression is also promoted, and several insults to foster tumor occur. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maintenance of imprinting is crucial to prevent aberrant expression of the gene.</p>
<p>In this cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR. As such an insulator protein called CTCF can’t bind at the ICR, resulting in the methylation of the neighboring H19gene. Through enhancers downstream, the Igf2gene can now be expressed.</p>
<p>The maternal allele however is not methylated at the ICR, and as such the CTCF can bind at the  ICR, the H19gene is not methylated, and since CTCF constitutes an insulation protein, the gene enhancers downstream of the cluster can act on the maternal H19, and can’t act on the maternal Igf2.</p>
<p>Thus only one copy of H19, and one of Igf2 is expressed in healthy cells.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor however, this pattern of gene expression is disturbed by hyper-methylation of the ICR. In this case now both alleles are methylated, so that the CTCF can’t bind at the ICR anymore, and thus the Igf2 is expressed from both the paternal and the maternal allele. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter gene, the disruption of the imprinting contributes to the tumor by growth promotion.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug belonging to the class of DNMT-inhibitors. As such it is a drug that targets DNMT (specifically DNMT1), an enzyme crucial for establishment of the demethylation pattern of dividing cells.</p>
<p>Since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than healthy cells, the idea is that Decitabine inhibits the demethylation patterns of the newly established (most likely) cancerous cells, which probably showed the DNA methylation pattern as discussed in Q1. Such aberrant methylation patterns are associated with certain tumors, and thus if those methylation patterns can be disrupted, the tumor formation process will be hindered.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The major mechanism through which drugs can have an effect lasting beyond the period of drug treatment is through the stability of the methylation pattern. The methylation pattern is mitotically heritable, and as such will be observed in ‘freshly divided’ new cells after the process of mitosis. This is mostly established through the enzymes called DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).</p>
<p>There are two crucial periods however, where the methylation pattern is altered fundamentially, namely where the DNA methylation is removed and re-established completely (with the exception of imprinted genes, where only one period occurs, and of IAPs where none occurs). These two period take place in the stage of the fertilized egg / blastocyst, which lasts until in the epiblast the pattern is re-established, and in the development of the primordial gene cells.</p>
<p>Since the methylation pattern is changed so drastically in these periods, they are also coined the sensible periods, and patients in these periods are very sensible to alteration of their methylation patterns (especially in the establishment of the new pattern).</p>
<p>Therefore it is not advisable to treat patients with drugs altering the methylome in these sensible periods.</p>
