    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>About 60% of promoters contain CpG islands. In normal cells, CpG islands, whether active or not, are typically unmethylated. But CpG island hypermethylation, which leads to gene silencing, is a feature of cancer cells. This gene silencing, when inactivating tumor suppressor genes, contributes to disease because tumor suppressors are not expressed and therefore cannot properly inhibit disease onset and progression.</p>
<p>Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps maintain genomic stability, preventing illegitimate recombinations (e.g., deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions). When hypomethylated, repetitive elements are able to transpoose (i.e., jump around the genome). This disrupts or activates genes. There is evidence that hypomethylation causes instability and therefore cancer/disease: Hypomethylation in mice due to Dnmt1 deletion causes cancer in certain tissues. Huan DNMT3B mutation causes ICF syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, which prevents CTCF from binding. Upstream enhancers are not blocked by the ICR and are therefore able to cause Igf2 expression. The maternal ICR, however, is normally unmethylated, so CTCF is able to bind and block upstream enchancers from promoting Igf2 expression. H19 is also expressed on the maternal side.</p>
<p>But in cancer, the maternal ICF is methylated. Upstream enhancers promote Igf2 expression, leading to a double dose of this growth promoter. WIlm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor, results.</p>
<p>Cancer cells often display loss of imprinting, meaning that parent-of-origin imprinting is lost. Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, and abnormal growth is related to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, a class of drugs that reduce DNA methylation. The DNA of cells treated with decitabine loses methylation because the drug inhibits the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). By reducing methylation, decitabine removes the epigenetic anomalies that cause these diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation patterns endure in an individual because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable throughout the lifetime of that individual. This means that marks in a given cell will be recreated in that cell's progeny.</p>
<p>Globally, mammals and other animals have a sensitive period (i.e., time when epigenetic marks are particularly susceptible to environmental and other insults) just after fertilization to just after blastocyst formation when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Primordial germ cells are also reprogrammed in utero. Postnatally, there are also tissue-specific sensitive periods. Because the precise mechanism of action of epigenetically active drugs is not yet well characterized, treatment with these drugs should be avoided during these times because of the enduring effects they have.</p></div>
