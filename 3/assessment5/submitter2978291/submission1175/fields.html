    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. Methylation variability was detected in cancer specific differentially methylated regions (cDMRs), which might contribute to tumor heterogeneity. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors. In contrast, no differential methylation of shore regions was detected in different lineages of the (murine) immune system.</p>
<p>Many developmental genes that are silenced by H3K27me3 in embryonic stem cells are silenced by DNA methylation in cancer cells. Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral  insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes. It has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing.</p>
<p>Increased transcription of satellite repeats was associated with DNA damage and genomic instability (it  was also detected in BRCA1 deficient murine and human breast cancers) Overexpression of satellite repeats identified in pancreatic and other epithelial cancers, indicating that disruption of heterochromatin may result in genomic instability in a variety of human cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is lncRNA that's being produced just from the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated in imprint control region (maternal allele) it is bound by a protein called CTCF (insulator protein) and  is able to insulate CTCF's binding insulate Igf2. Because it's insulating IGF2 enhancers are free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the patternal allele, imprint control region is methlyated, so CTCF can no longer bind. If  CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action, enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2's expression. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>There is effectively appearance of two paternal like alleles and loss of maternal like allele. By losing maternal like allele, two paternal like alleles are expressed and the result is too much Igf.If there is no Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor) expression and up regulation of IGF2 (oncogene) there will be overall growth promotion. Loss of imprinting and overexpression of growth promoting genes or loss of those geno suppress genes because of the loss of imprinting are disrupted in Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dacitibine belongs to a class of DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands (while related drug azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains) </p>
<p>Dacitibine is nucleoside analog. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. When the DNA methyltransferase binds to dacitibine, DNMT1 also comes along to bind that nucleotide so it can copy the methylation to the daughter strand. Because the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly it can no longer be released.</p>
<p>The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so it is necceseary to have the cell replicating. Cancer cell are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body so they willl be more  severely affected because od their enhanced replication. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is still unknown how specific is this DNA de-methyltransferase. It probably hits all dividing cells to some extent, so it is unknown what the long term consequences would be on normal cells. Most cells will divide at some point and if the demethylation transferase have been taken, then they have the potential to be affected. Also, we don't know that  DNA demethylation is their only mechanism of action. Maybe that they're having an effect through other ways as well.</p>
<p>Sensitive period are two periods of germ cell development and early embryonic development.The first sensitive period  is the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms. The second sensitive period is the pre implanted and early post implantation period.</p>
<p>These drugs are going to be used throughout the system until every cell could has a potential to be effected. So it is necessary to keep in mind the younger patients in sensitive periods, particularly those that are developing germ cell. They shouldn’t be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery. </p></div>
