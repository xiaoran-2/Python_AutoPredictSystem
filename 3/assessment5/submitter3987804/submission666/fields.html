    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions of densely packed CpG that are found at about 60% of the promoters of genes.  They are normally hypomethylated and thus tend to allow the expression of the promoter and of the underlying gene.  In cancer we find that there is a decrease in global methylation that is accompanied by an increase in the methylation of some CpG islands.  If a CpG island is at the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene, the hypermethylation of the island will silence the tumour suppressor gene.  The methylation has been found to spread from the CpG island through its neighbouring CpG island shores to the associated promoters and genes.  As DNA methylation states are mitotically heritable, the hypermethylated status of the islands can be maintained.  By inactivating tumour suppression this hypermethylation is one of the many insults that may contribute to the development and eventual metastasis of tumours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally hypermethylated and heterochromatic.  This inactivation helps to stop mutagenic transpositions and other genomic interference and, in so doing, maintain genomic stability.  In concert with the genome wide hypomethylation that is characteristic of cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also demethylated.  What can result is an abnormal karyotype due to the increased genomic instability as the intergenic regions and repeats become hypomethylated and thus activated.  There can be misalignments or illegitimate recombinations and transpositions – such as deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations – between repeats.  There is also the possibility of activation of cryptic promoters and flow-on disruptions to neighbouring genes.  These destabilising genomic insults may lead to mutagenic activation, inactivation or retargeting of genes or gene products or the overexpression of some genes, all of which, depending on context, can have cancer-causing consequences.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is situated around an imprint control region (ICR).  Typically, the ICR on the paternal allele will be hypermethylated and consequently cannot bind with the insulator protein CTCF.  The methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing H19.  The downstream enhancers in this case are not blocked from accessing Igf2 and thus its expression is promoted on the paternal allele.   In contrast, the ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated, so CTCF can bind here and effectively insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers.  The enhancers activate H19 and, as they are blocked from accessing Igf2, it is unexpressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour there is a loss of imprinting due to hypermethylation of the ICRs.  In this disease the ICRs on both the maternal and paternal alleles are hypermethylated, so no CTCF can bind.  On both alleles the methylation spreads to the promoters of H19, silencing its expression and, as there is no block to the enhancers’ action on Igf2, a double dose of Igf2 compared to normal is expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This disrupted imprinting contributes to disease as Igf2 is growth promoting and its overexpression can contribute to the rapid multiplication of tumour cells in the body.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer treatment targetting epigenetic machinery and is approved for use as a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.  It is a DNMT inhibitor, that is, it is a DNA demethylating agent which works by interrupting the laying down and maintenance of methylation by DNMTs.  It is a nucleoside analogue that binds irreversibly to DNMTs after they have been incorporated into DNA, and is thus replication dependent.  At low doses Decitabine has been shown to attack tumours which are in the neoplastic phase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through inhibiting DNMT, Decitabine hypomethylates DNA.  This can have an anti-tumour effect if the class of tumour being treated is driven by tumour-suppressor hypermethylation, as is thought to be the case for myelodysplastic syndromes.  By demethylating the tumour-suppressor genes, they can re-activate, and as Decitabine is bound in DNA its hypomethylating function is replicated across cell divisions, allowing continued expression of tumour-suppressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effect beyond the period of their administration as cells have mechanisms  to “remember” their methylation status and pass it on mitotically to daughter cells.  When methylation status is actively altered, it can then be maintained and replicated through cell division.  However, such treatments are often systemic and can affect all cells, not just tumour cells, so may have long-term downstream side effects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is important to avoid treatment with such drugs during sensitive developmental periods.  These occur at several stages of the life cycle.  In early embryonic development there are two waves of epigenetic reprogramming: during pre-implantation and early development, where the genome is cleared between generations, and again mid-gestation during the development of the embryo’s primordial germ cells.  It is inadvisable to treat pregnant women as this may affect the epigenetic marks and PGC development of their embryo.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The individual remains sensitive after birth, as germ cells are still undergoing maturation.  In embryonic development the sensitive periods are associated with widespread demethylation; and in childhood the oocytes, for instance, remain demethylated until puberty.  Treatment should be avoided at these times as germ cells are susceptible to any sources of disruption and any resulting abnormalities could be passed on to offspring.</p></div>
