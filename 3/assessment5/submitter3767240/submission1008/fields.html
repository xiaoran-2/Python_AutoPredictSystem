    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is symmetrically methylated at CpG islands de novo by methyltransferases. CpG islands are normally gene promoters and protected from methylation. DNA methylation silences genes and transposomes, and has a role in X chr inactivation. DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions helps maintain genomic instability by avoiding aberrant recombination. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can increase the possibility of having different chromosomes (ex chr 6 wth chr 3) exchange genetic information (changes in karyotype), leading to aberrant gene expression, frame shift mutations, etc.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements silences transposomes- stops these regions from "moving" to other areas on the chromosomes.</p>
<p>In cancer,  methyl transferases and demethylation enzymes are mutated, methylation is lost (hypomethilation) transposomes- repetitive elements are now active, and intergenic regions are now unmethylated and suceptible to recombination, causing genetic instability. Also, CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to silencing of tumor suppresors. Genome wide hypomethylation is observed.</p>
<p>DNA demethylation also leads to the activaiton of oncogenes, genes that promote growth.</p>
<p>Cancer cells may also upregulate DNA methylation (hypermethylation) in tumor suppressor genes, leading to loss of growth control. Tumor suppressor genes are key in controling cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis and DNA repair&gt; without that control, the cell will divide uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Activation of oncogenes, silencing of tumor suppressor genes and aberrant karyotypes are the hallmarks of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption in imprinting can lead to a materal allele to look like a paternal allele, so there will not be a materal allele (uniparental disomy). Thus, the information coded by the maternal allele is lost (or vice versa)</p>
<p>For example, it is important to regulate Igf2 expression (oncogene).</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, CTCF is able to bind to its binding site (ICR) on the maternal allele. it can then interact with upstream enhancers and H19 expression. Because the enhancers interact with CTCF, Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, CTCF is not able to bind. Furthermore, ICR methylation "spreads" to the H19 promoter, silencing it. The enhancers then are able to interact with Igf2, leading to its expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR (and H19 promoter) in the maternal allele is methylated, making it look like the paternal allele- H19 is silenced, Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to upretulagion of Igf2- oncogene- leading to aberrant cell proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. One of the hallmarks of cancer is hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes control cell growht and proliferation by limiting when and how many times a cell can divide. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes (methylation) leads to uncontrolled tumor proliferation (cancer). By removing mehtylation marks from tumor suppressor genes, the cell can control cell growth, thus leading to a reduction in tumor proliferation. This may also leave the tumor cells more succeptible to treatment.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA epigenetics is mitotically inherited. When a tumor cell with hypermethylation (silencing) of tumor suppressor genes is treated with demethylating agents, those genes can now be de-methylated and activated. These genes now can control cell growth and proliferation. Since epigenetics is inherited, once a certain tumor suppressor gene is de-methylated, all daughter cells will have this gene de-methylated.</p>
<p>A sensitive period invovles those moments when epigenetic marks need to be carried on during mitosis or meiosis. For example, Epigenetic inheritance is important during gemr cell development. A germ cell needs to maintain the imprinting information otherwise the fetus will not develop properly. Another sensitive period is during fetal development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods may have a great impact in germ cell development and fetal development. Cells will not be able to maintain their imprinting patterns, leading to aberrant development (maternal behaving like paternal chromosomes- uniparental disomy), causing predisposition to cancer and other syndromes and diseases.</p></div>
