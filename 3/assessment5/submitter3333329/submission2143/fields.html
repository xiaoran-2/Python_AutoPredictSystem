    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, you will find that CpG islands are hypomethylated while DNA methylation tends to occur at intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and various introns in the genome.  This is swapped in cancer so that the CpG islands are hypermethylated while the intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns are hypomethylated.  Normally, DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotides functions to silence a gene.  The problem that occurs in cancer is that that CpG islands (which are clusters of CpG dinucleotides) will acquire abnormal hypermethylation that results in transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, this will mean that all daughter cells will also inherit the silenced tumor suppressor genes, and as a result there will be an unending division of the cancerous cells that will lead to the formation of a tumor.  Similarly, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally functions to silence expression.  This is disrupted in cancer as these regions are hypomethylated and therefore expressed.  In addition to expression of these regions, there is a level of genomic instability created as the genome is no longer being densely packaged into heterochromatin.  Examples of this instability can be seen in illegitimate recombination of repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptonic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.  It is this genomic instability that enhances tumorigenesis and contributes to the disease.  It is important to remember, however, that DNA methylation's role in causing cancer is context dependent and that different tumors will have different dependencies on locus specific hypermethylation and genome wide hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer as alternations of DNA methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) results in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.  For example, in a normal cell, the paternal allele will have a methylated ICR which will prevent the binding of CTCF and will allow the enhancers to act on Igf2 so that it will be expressed.  The maternal allele, on the other hand, will have an unmethylated ICR onto which CTCF will bind; this will then cause the enhancers to express H19 instead of Igf2.  The problem that occurs in Wilm's tumor is that there is methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele.  This will mean that Igf2 will be expressed on both alleles, and as it is growth promoting, its overexpression results in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors knowns as DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitors).  Like other DNMTis, Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which can irreversably bind to DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into the DNA and cause DNA demethylation.  As DNMTis are division dependent, and in cancer the cells will be dividing at an abnormally high rate, the effects of the drug can be amplified to suppress cell division in cancer, and therefore the tumor.  Today, Decitabine is given in low doses to many patients in order to optimize the anti-neoplastic effect, but we are still unsure about the mechanism of action and the long-term effects it may have on normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The idea behind epigenetic treatment of cancer is to reprogram the network of chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells.  Experiments have been conducted by scientists such as Dr. Stephen Baylin that suggest demethylating drugs produce a "memory" antitumor response.  As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, altering it using epigenetic drugs can have promising long-term effects provided that the drugs are given during appropriate time periods.  A sensitive period in development is a period of time when the epigenetic make-up of an organism is particularly susceptible to changes which may occur in the environment.  In humans, there are two such sensitive periods of development.  The first is the period from primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature gametes.  The second is the pre-implantation to early post-implantation period.  During both of these periods there is active remodelling of the epigenome.  Treating patients in these sensitive periods would be inadvisable as during this time DNA methylation must occur to ensure certain genes are silenced; we think that these drugs tend to be non-specific, so if they were to cause demethylation of genes which should be methylated, it could lead to disasterous consequences.</p></div>
