    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the CpG islands are usually not methylated, which can most often than not ensure gene expression. However, in cancer cells, the CpG islands of promoter regions are hypermethylated inhibiting gene expression. That can contribute to cancer considering that many of these affected genes are tumor suppressor genes. Since this epigenetic change is mitotically heritable, the new cells originated from the epigenetically changed cells will also have their tumor suppressor genes silenced. In addition, the cells that are mutated are most likely to proliferate faster and escape death, contributing to the rise and spreading of tumors. Consequently, the epimutations progresses as cancer also progresses.</p>
<p>The opposite occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells, those regions are hypermethylated and it is seen that in cancer patients, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The reason for methylating those regions is that it brings genomic stability. Therefore, cancer cells are genomic instable. That means that deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations can occur. Reciprocal translocations happen because the repeats are long and are usually able to align, which would not occur if the repetitive elements where methylated and densely packed. Transposition is also an example of genomic instability, for the translocated region may jump to the middle of a gene disrupting it, and it can also activate a gene that should be silenced.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are associated with growth. Considering that cancer cells have a disruption in their growth pattern, the imprinted genes can greatly affect the rise of tumors.</p>
<p>An example of that can be seen in the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the Igf2 gene is only being expressed in the paternal allele and it is silent in the maternal allele. That happens because the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele. Therefore, the transcriptional repressor CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. Thus the enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene and it is expressed. The opposite happens in the maternal allele. Since the ICR is not methylated, CTCF can bind to the ICR and the enhancers will act on the H19, a tumor suppressor gene, expressing it and the Igf2 gene will not be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor both ICR are methylated. Therefore, the Igf2 gene will be expressed on both alleles and the H19 will not be expressed on the maternal allele as seen in a normal cell. The gene Igf2 is involved in promoting cellular growth. Therefore, the superexpression of this gene will promote abnormal growth which will result in the tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Therefore, it inhibits the methylation of DNA, and can disrupt the progression of cancer, for it will not allow the hypermethylation of CpG islands, which in turn will not silence tumor suppressor genes. This is seen in myelodysplastic syndromes in which hypermethylated CpG islands ensure a poor prognosis, but the intake of Decitabine will have a positive effect on the patient.</p>
<p>This drug binds to DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA, reflecting their replication dependency. Considering that cancer cells characteristically replicate more rapidly they are easily targeted.</p>
<p>The downside of the drug is their specificity and action mechanism. It is known that Decitabine inhibs methylation by acting on the enzyme responsible for methylating DNA. Nevertheless, it is not known if that is its only effect and how specific the drug is considering that there is methylation in a number of others cells that are not cancerous. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By altering DNA methylation the entire genome of the patient can be influenced. That happens because virtually all cells suffer epigenetic changes and depending on the drug administered, the patient can see an effect in the hypomethylation of genes that should be methylated.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming are early development (formation of embryo) and germ cell development, which correspond to the periods of fastest growth and development. Treating patients while in those periods is not recommended because it can greatly affect all epigenetic programming of their entire genome, not influencing only cancer cells. In addition, by altering the epigenetic programming of germ cells, it can negatively affect the progeny as well.</p>
<p>During sensitive periods, the cells are not methylated, but will need to be methylated after these periods. Therefore, by using drugs that inhibits DNA methyltrasferase, for instance, it can disrupt the methylation of the entire genome and result in hypomethylation in all cells. </p></div>
