    <h1>Submission 792 from Anon (session_user_id: 13e6afe6e2fd7e66dd3810eab8f32fca9cec2853)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine commercially known as Dacogen belongs to DNMT epigenetic inhibitor group. They irreversibly bind to DNMT of the dividing cells. It is DNA-de-metylating drug. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine as well as azacitadine causes DNA hypomethylation in low doses. It integrates to DNA and leads to death of abnormal hematopoietic cell. </span></p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on the epigenome since it causes epignetic changes that can be passed on to several generations. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Sensitive periods are the periods then the epigenetic events are taking place: this is at pre-implantation and during primordial cell development, which happens to be during early pregnancy. Treatment of the patiens during the sensitive period could cause severe impact on few generations: mom, baby to come and it's of springs since primordial germ cells are formed then. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is normally not methylated at CpG islands; they are usually present at the 5' regulatory regions of the genes.</p>
<p>During the cancerogenesis it CpG islands turn to be hyper-methylated leading to the disruption of the gene transcription which can be inherited by offspring cells. Due to both hyper and hypo-DNA methylation, at CpG islands cancers turns to emerge and progress.</p>
<p>Normally DNA is methylated at intragenic regions and repetitive elements where it is thought to contribute to genomic stability. During the cancerogenesis DNA is un-methylated in intragenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intragenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to disease as it disrupts genomic stability.  </p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is active in the paternal allele since in paternal allele H19 is methylated and this prevents CTCF insulator protein from binding to ICR and enables enhancers to act on Igf2.</p>
<p>On maternal allele Igf2 is inactive since H19 is transcribed and lets CTCF to bind ICR and prevents enhancer activity on Igf2.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumors as a part of Beckwith Weidermann syndrome causes maternal allele to behave as paternal in other words Igf2 gene becomes active.</p>
<p>As a result in Beckwith Weidermann syndrome epigenetic disruption of oncogene Igf2 takes place leading to overgrow.  </p></div>
