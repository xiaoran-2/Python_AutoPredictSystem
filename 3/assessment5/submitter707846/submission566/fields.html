    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal gene segments the CpG islands associated with promoters are typically unmethylated while the intergenic and repetitive elements are methylated. This arrangement provides an environment wherein the gene of interest is expressed, the chromosome integrity is maintained, and the repetitive elements are prevented from copying and/or inserting themselves randomly throughout the genome.</p>
<p>When CpG islands associated with promoters of tumor suppressor genes get hypermethylated due to some genetic disruptions in the DNA methyl transferase enzymes (DNMTs) the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, the tumor promoting genes are expressed, and carcinogenesis ensues.</p>
<p>Although hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor gene promoters has long been recognized as universally occurring in carcinogeneis, the hypomethylation of oncogene promoter regions, intergenic elements, and DNA repeats are also involved in carcinogenesis. With the hypomethylation of oncogene promoters, the oncogenes are expressed, leading to carcinogenesis. When the intergenic elements are hypomethylated, aberrations in chromosome structure such as translocations and illegitimate recombinations occur. These assaults in chromosome architecture can start a cascade of events that result in carcinogenesis. When repetitive elements are hypomethylated, these sequences can copy and/or transpose themselves into other regions of the genome. Such events can disrupt gene expression through transcriptional interference, again leading to carcinogenesis. <br /> What brings about such disruptions in DNA methylation patterns? Several researchers suggest that genetic disruptions in the enzyme DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) lead to the abnormal patterns of DNA methylation. Transcriptional repression of hypermethylated DNA could result in interference with the binding of transcription factors to the recognition sites in the promoters, silencing gene expression. Methylation of specific DNA segments that are normally unmethylated could lead to direct binding of specific transcriptional repressors. DNA methylation directly affects histone modifications and chromatin structure, which alter gene expression when the patterns are disrupted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions in genomic imprinting lead to over- or under- expression of specific gene products. If the over expressed gene affects oncogene promoters, or the under expressed product affects tumor suppressor promoters, carcinogenesis will ensue. <br /> In Wilms’ tumor there is loss of maternal or duplication of paternal chromosome 11 p15.5 H19/Igf2 locus. H19 is normally transcribed from maternal, and Igf2 from paternal allele. This monoallelic differential expression (imprinting) is due to the ICR, located upstream of H19 promoter. Both H19 and Igf2 genes share the same enhancers downstream of H19. The maternal ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind, shielding the upstream Igf2 from the enhancers, silencing the maternal Igf2. The paternal ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding, enhancers activate Igf2 promoter, transcribing the paternal allele. The methylation of the paternal ICR spreads downstream into the H19 promoter, silencing paternal H19.<br /> In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR gets methylated, CTCF no longer binds and shields maternal Igf2 from the enhancers, so the individual expresses maternal and paternal Igf2 products, a growth-promoting, mitogenic protein. There is plenty of growth promoting but not enough growth suppressing factors resulting in disrupted rate of cells division, a hallmark of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a signature of epigenetics. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are essential in delivering methyl group to targeted DNA and maintaining stability of the epigenome. When DNMTs are overexpressed, certain promoters that are normally unmethylated can get methylated and if these promoters are associated with tumor suppressor genes, the genes are inadvertently silenced. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes lead to carcinogenesis. </p>
<p>Decitabine, a citidine analog, is FDA approved for treatment of myeloid dysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. The drug is a DNMT inhibitor that is metabolized and incorporated into genomic DNA. The nucleoside is recognized by DNMT as a potential substrate and upon binding, DNMT is irreversibly trapped and eventually degraded during subsequent replication, thereby depleting DNMT cellular concentration. In addition, decitabine has been shown to reactivate some epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes in controlled laboratory experiments. Reactivating the tumor suppressor genes makes decitabine a potent anti-tumor agent.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Tumor cells result when normal epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation are altered. DNA methylation is passed down to daughter cells during cell division and for as long as DNMT1 is active, each new generation of cells retain the marks. Reprogramming erases epigenetic marks to re-establish cellular pleuripotency and lay down new markers. Epigenetic reprogramming takes place during pre-implantation and primordial germ cell development, the sensitive periods of development. During these periods, it is not advisable to administer epigenetic drugs because the markers which the drugs target have not been fully established and the drugs could bind to the “wrong substrate” and damage the genome further.</p>
<p>The combination of epigenetic drugs such as azacitidine and histone deacetylase inhibitor as suggested by Baylin can prime tumor cells for later sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. It is possible that the hypomethylating agent demethylates CpG islands in promoters of tumor suppressor genes and the expression of these genes is synergistic to the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs. Likewise, the histone deacetylase inhibitors could keep the nucleosomes more relaxed, allowing chemotherapeutic drugs access to some of the heterochromtinized region such as the centromere, disrupting the mitotic machinery of cancer cells.  </p></div>
