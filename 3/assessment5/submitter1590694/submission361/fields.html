    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer has been associated with two disruptive changes in typical DNA methylation.  First, the overall level of methylation in the epigenome is reduced in cancer cells, allowing for the overexpression of genes. Second, and contrary to the first phenomenon, methylation at CpG islands in gene promoter regions is increased, whereas in non-cancer cells these particular CpG islands would not be methylated and would serve to allow the promoter region to function.  This second phenomenon has, conceptually, has a causal relationship with cancer when promoter regions in cell-cycle regulatory genes are affected and regulatory genes are silenced.</p>
<p> In intergenic regions it is understood that DNA methylation plays a role in protecting the genome from transposable elements (ref: week 2 lecture “Genome Defense Model).  When the normal patterns of DNA methylation are disrupted, genomic instability results from the introduction of transposable elements throughout the genome, altering gene regulation.  These altered patterns of gene expression can, in turn, cause disease.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is necessary to silence either the paternal or maternal copy of a gene when normal development requires expression of only one copy of the gene.  When imprinting fails, the overexpression of an oncogene or underexpression of a growth suppressor may contribute to cancer.  </p>
<p>For example, consider the gene Igf2.  In the normal paternal allele, methylation of an ICR prevents binding of a CTCF insulator protein that would prevent the downstream enhancers from moving upstream and stimulating Igf2 expression.  So, ICR methylation leads to IGF2 expression in the paternal allele.  In contrast, in the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, CTCF binds, and the enhancers cannot reach Igf2. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, an overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 may contribute.  Notably, Wilm’s tumor is a childhood cancer, which makes sense given that Igf2 would be expressed during childhood growth and an imprinting fault would lead to overexpression during childhood.   </p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease if both maternal and paternal versions of the H19/Igf2 cluster are either methylated as in the paternal version (too much Igf2, not enough H19) or are unmethylated as in the maternal (too much H19, not enough Igf2).  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of hypomethylating agents which act to reduce the level of DNA methylation.   Decitabine’s anti-tumor effect comes from reducing hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with the promotion and transcription of tumor suppressor genes, leading to a “more orderly DNA methylation profile” (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndromes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndromes</a>).  The drug achieves hypomethylation by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.  The drug would not act on existing cells but would, as cells divide, prevent DNA methyltransferase from copying methylation patterns to DNA strands in daughter cells.  The risk here is that all methylation could be affected throughout the patient, causing potentially serious side effects.  However, since tumor cells are dividing at a much faster rate than surrounding cells, they should be most affected by the drug during the time it is administered. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While the cause and effect relationship between epigenetic and genetic mutations in cancer is not understood, there is some relationship between the two in the maintenance of tumor growth (we see both epigenetic and genetic mutations in cancer tumor cells).  Thus, it is not surprising that addressing the epigenetic mutations in a cancer cell may, while not eliminating tumor growth, set the conditions for standard chemotherapy to defeat cancer cells.  </p>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment because the molecular machinery that makes DNA methylation pattern mitotically heritable; new methylation patterns will persist in daughter cells.  </p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods in epigenetic development when epigenetic marks are mostly stripped away and then reestablished. These periods are from primordial germ cell growth through formation of gametes, and again as a fertilized egg reaches the blastocyst stage through to formation of the epiblast.  Introduction of drugs or other treatments which affect patterns of methylation during these sensitive periods are likely to do more harm than good in light of the current inability to target specific DNA for hypo or hypermethylation and the global effect any current treatments would have. </p></div>
