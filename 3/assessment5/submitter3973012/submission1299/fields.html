    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the chemical addition of a methyl group to (primarily) Cytosine in a CpG site - Cytosine bound through a phosphate to Guanin, converting the cytosine to a 5-methylcytosine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG Islands</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>In normal cells, most CpG sites within CpG islands are unmethylated. Where CpG sites within CpG islands are methylated, the implication is silencing of transcription of the gene downstream of the CpG island, either by direct effect of the methylated cytosines on transcription factors, or by recruting additional agents that lay down repressive histone modifications and remove activating modifications. These modifications colaborate to densely pack the chromatin, making it less accessible to transcription. These changes are (at least partially) conserved mitotically.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, CpG Islands become hypermethylated. Which CpG islands become hyper methylated depends on the cancer type and stage. Generally, these would be CpG islands upstream of tumor supressor genes. These may also be CpG islands of the epigenetic machinery. In some cases many genes in ranges of mega-blocks become hypermethylated (LRES).</p>
<p>In addition to the direct effect of inhibiting tumor suppresors, the dense heterochromatin does not lend itself as well to error correction, leading to genetic aberrations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repetitions and Intergenic Regions</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>In normal cells, most CpG sites and Intergenic regions are methylated. Methylating repeats is crucial in preserving genomic stability. It prevents aberrant alignment of non-homologous repeats, aberrant recombinations, translocations, etc.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, repeats and intergenic regions become hypomethylated, resulting in activated repeats, together with euchromatin that is more liable to aberrant recombinations at these repeats; there may also be transpositions, interrupting other genes, or - if the transposed element contains strong promoters - overactivating other downstream genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer processes interfere with DNA methylation - both adding and removing CpG metylation - including ICRs. As many imprinted genes are related to growth and growth control, they are naturally correlated to neoplasms.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, CTCF is able to bind to the unmethylated ICR. CTCF insulates the downstream enhancers from acting on the maternal Igf2, so that Igf2 is not expressed in a normal cell from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, disabling CTCF from binding into it. This allows the downstream enhancers to act on the paternal Igf2 and express it.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, both alleles are methylated, so that both are showing the paternal methylation pattern, and indeed the paternal Igf2 expression. This leads to increased Igf2 expression. As Igf2 is a growth promoter, its over-expression contributes to the development of a tumor.</p>
<p>In addition, the ICR methylation expands and methylates the H19 tumor suppresor promoter, decreasing its expression from the maternal allele in which it is normally expressed.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) drug, currently approved for the treatment of myelodysplasic syndrome that has progressed to AML. Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analogue; during mitosis, if decitabine is present in the cell, it can be incorporated into the daughter cell instead of cytosine. When the maintenance methyltransferase attempts to copy methylation from the parent strand to a (instead-of-cytosine) decitabine, the decitabine binds the DNMT and does not let go. This interrupts the maintenance methylation during mitosis, resulting in lower methylation of the daughter cells.</p>
<p>Cancer cells have a much higher frequency of divisions than normal cells. Hence, they are the most affected by decitabine. Lower methylation of CpG islands may reactivate tumor suppressors, and/or lead to apoptosis (self-destruct).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks remain for the most part stable along the life of a somatic cell. DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. as part of mitosis, maintenance DNA methyltransferase copies the methylation marks from the template strand to the daughter strand.</p>
<p>There are two periods where extensive epigenetic reprogramming takes place:</p>
<p>In early development, from the zygote through preimplantation and up to early postimplantation.</p>
<p>For germ cells, from premordial germ cells to eggs and sperm.</p>
<p>In both cases, the epigenetic information is removed (with some exceptions, e.g. repeats) and later new epigenetic marks are layed down.</p>
<p>During both of these periods, the delicate process of epigenetic remodelling is sensitive to environmental insults and may be hampered by them.</p>
<p>The existing epigenetic drugs, such as the ones described by Dr Baylin, are relatively non-specific - they do not only target cancerl cells; and by-design have significant effects on the epigenetic machinery. The full set of implications of these drugs is not fully understood.</p>
<p>Administering epigenetic drugs within sensitive periods (for youngsters with germ cells during development, perhaps also to pregnant mothers) is likely to interrupt with the epigenetic reprogramming, as the drugs are designed to do just that - interefere with the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
