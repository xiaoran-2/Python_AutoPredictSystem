    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands:</strong> CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation so that necessary genes are expressed.  However, if promoter CpG islands for tumor suppressor genes happened to become hypermethylated, these genes are silenced and the risk of cancer increases.  Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells of the cancer cell will also likely have silenced tumor suppressor genes and the cancer will spread.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements:</strong> These regions are usually methylated, resulting in densely packed chromatin.  In cancer cells, they are hypomethylated and the chromatins will have looser structure.  It causes genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats and more likely it gives rise to a cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, H19 of the paternal allele is methylated, thus not suppressing the enhancers from letting Igf2 be expressed, whereas H19 of the maternal allele is not methylated, thus suppressing the enhancers from letting Igf2 be expressed.  In total, single dose of Igf2 is expressed.  In Wilm's tumor, both maternal and paternal H19 alleles are methylated and double dose of Igf2 is expressed.  Since Igf2 is a growth factor, this means higher risk of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor that acts as a DNA-demethylating agent.  It acts on DNA when it is replicated and since cancer cells have much higher replication rate than normal cells, decitabine mostly affects tumor cells.  Since methylation in general is essential for cell functions including growth, deprived of that functionality, tumor cells will be eventually killed much more often than normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the effects of epigenetic treatment will be passed down to daughter cells.  However, there are two sensitive periods for human development when environmental effects on epigenetic control are fatal--first during the early development from fertilized egg to blastocyst and second during primordial germ cells development.  Therefore, epigenetic drugs are not advisable for pregnant women.</p></div>
