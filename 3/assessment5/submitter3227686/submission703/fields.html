    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells would have hypomethylation at CpG islands, which means no methylation in CpG in general. Normal cells would also have methylated repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and gene introns. Whereas in cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, with hypomethylated repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and gene introns. DNA hypomethylation activates oncogenes and initiates chromosome instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes. CGIs are found in tumor suppressor genes, and DNA methylation at CGI can silence tumor suppressor genes, which contributes to cancer. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer cell, both IR and RE are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation which occurs on intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer will lead to genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition, etc). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the maternal allele, unmethylated ICR allows CTCF (insulator protein) to bind and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. THe maternal allele will then produce a lncRNA H19. This cannot happen for the paternal allele, where the ICR is methylated. Methylated ICR blocks CTCF binding, and without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter for silencing, and enhancers will access Igf2 for activation, resulting in Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, ICR is hypermethylated on maternal allele. The result is an overexpression of Igf2. Because Igf2 is growth-promoting, therefore it is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNMTi (DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors). Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analogues, which means that they can be incorporated into DNA upon replication, and then irreversibly bind DNMTs when DNMTs are binding to copy the methylation for the daughter cells. This makes it replication-dependent. Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect because they deivide faster than a normal cell. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitoically heritable, altering the methylation therefore would have an enduring effects. Sensitive period is the period of epigenetic reprogramming which occurs in primordial germ cells and in somatic cells. There are 2 sensitive periods, that is during pre-implantation (early development) and primordial germ cell (PGC) development. On younger patients, the germ cells effects also needs to be considered because the treatment would still have effect on every cells. The risk is that with these treatments, we can accidentally turn off the ongoing epigenetic machinery that is continuously going in the primordial germ cells. </p></div>
