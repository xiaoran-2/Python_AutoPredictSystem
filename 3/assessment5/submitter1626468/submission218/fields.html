    <div class="field-value"><p>There is normally no DNA metyhylation at CPG islands. If there is methylation (termed hypermethylation) then the result is usually no expression of nearby genes and in this case the non expressed gene would be a tumor suppressor gene. Studies have shown that in many cancers, the CPG islands are hypermethylated resulting in the repression of the tumor growth suppressers allowing  cells to grow without regulation. The hpermethylation has been found to grow over time as the cancer progresses through stages and is mitotically heritable. In contrast there is usually DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Such methylation, genome wide, helps in overall stability. In the absence of methylation issues can arise. For example the reptitive regions  can become more active leading to insertions, delitions, crosses and unintended activation of local genes. In certain CPG areas that are considered poor promoters, the hypomethylation can cause them to activate local genes and have unintended cell growth.  In combination with enhanced cell growth and genomic instability and the inactiviation of the tumour repressing genes, you can get the hallmarks of cancer - unconstrained cell growth. The impact of each abnormality (hypo or hyper methylation) will vary by the type of tumour and thus have implications for possible treatments.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele This methylation means that CTFC cannot bind to the ICR and the nearby promotors will act on Igf2 and express it. Igf2 is a growth promotor. In contrast the ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated allowing the binding agent CTCF to bind the ICR. This prevents the promotors from acrtivating Igf2 and instead they activate H19. When imprinting is dirupted in Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele. The maternal allele thus works the same as the paternal allele (Igf2 expression). This results in a double dose (both parent's alleles)  of a growth gene resulting in the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several types of altered DNA methylation which are associated with cancer. In normal cells there is a general hypermethylation in the intergenic regions as well as in the repeat regions supporting genome stability. If this situation is altered to hypomethylation, these areas can become active leading to genome instability and aberrant behavior. CPG islands are usually hypomthylated and allow expression of tumour suppression genes. If these areas become hypermethylated, the suppessor genes will become inactivated and therefore uncontrolled cell division can occur. There are also instances of  long range alterations where large mega base areas are altered which can have wide ranging impacts. These changes can be mitotically inherited and therefore maintained and have enduring impacts on the epigenome. A sensitive period is when the genome is undergoing some level of reprogramming (clearing and remarking methylation)band thus is inherently less stable and the normal epigenetic programming (methylation marks)bcan be adversely altered. The period of primorial germ cell development and pre-implantation and early development have been identified as sensitive periods.  If treatment is applied at this point, there is an increased chance that undesirable changes can occur and therefore disturb the normal workings of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. By binding to DNMT it can inhibit its function and result in the hypomethylation of the cell. It binds to the DNA and is replicated resulting in a strong impact on cancerous cells which undergo multiple replications. The hypomethylation allows tumour suppressing genes to be expressed and operate and thereby result in the normal regulation of cell growth  -- extra active DNMT was causing the hypermethylation of the DNA and the inactivation of the tumour repressing gene (generating tumours)</p></div>
