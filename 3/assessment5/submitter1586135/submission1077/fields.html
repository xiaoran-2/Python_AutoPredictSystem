    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group at the 5 carbon of Cytosine. In mammals methylation occurs almost exclusively at cytosine followed by guanine, indicated as CpG, with p representing the phosphate bond. CpG islands are clusters of CpGs in the DNA, often associated with a gene promoter. Methylated CpG island results in silencing of the associated gene, via the formation of a repressive chromarin structure and the prevention of transcription binding factors: meCpG can be bound by MECP 1 &amp; 2, proteins that have a transcriptional repressive domain and cen recruit other factors that condense chromatin.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated, while in tumor cells, methylation occurs in a locus specific way, at tumor suppressor genes promoters, hence inhibiting its normal expression. Being mitotically heritable and strongly selected for, this epigenetic aberration behaves as a cancer genetic mutation with the major difference of being reversible.</p>
<p>In normal cells both repeats and intergenic regions are methylated. DNA methylation is mutagenic but the benefit of having such regions methylated is that methylation, in these cases, enhance genomic integrity: methylation at intergenic regions , prevents transcriptions conflicts, while methylation at repetitive elemnts , prevents transposition by silencing repeats.</p>
<p>In tumor cells we observe hypomethylation genomewide, hence repetirive elements as well intergenic regions are not methylated. As explained before this results in genomic instability (deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug belonging to the DNMTi class (i.e. DNA Methyltransferase inhibitors), small molecules that target the DNMT enzyme. DNMT innhibitors are nucleotide analogues, that  after being incorporated in the DNA, irreversibly bind DNMT, and are hence replication dependent. DNMTis are therefore hypomethylating agents.</p>
<p>Their mechanism of action, as above described, lacks of specificity, and can then have long term effects also on normal cells. By being replication dependent, DNMTis are although effective on tumor cells since these cells show an high replication rate.</p>
<p>Decitabine is indicated for Myelodysplastic Syndrome progressing into AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia), since this desease, as other haematological malignancies, is dependent on tumor suppressor genes hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 / Igf2 cluster can be characterized as follows:</p>
<p>Igf2 (gene) --&gt; CTCF binding domain --&gt; H19 (gene) --&gt; enhancers</p>
<p> The two alleles, maternal and paternal, in normal cells, show the following epigenetic marks:</p>
<p>MAT: lgf2(gene) --&gt; CTCF binding domain [NOT methylated] --&gt; H19 (gene promoter) [NOT methylated] --&gt; enhancers</p>
<p>PAT: Igf2 (gene) --&gt; CTCF binding domain [methylated] --&gt; H19 (gene promoter) [methylated]--&gt; enhancers</p>
<p>Methylation of the CTCF binding domain, does not allow binding of CTCF, creating a favourable loop enhancers - Igf2. Accordingly, in normal cells, we have the following gene expression / sileng, for the two alleles :</p>
<p>MAT: Igf2 SILENCED --- H19 EXPRESSED</p>
<p>PAT: Igf2 EXPRESSED --- H19 SILENCED</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, cancer cells show methylation of the CTCF binding domain and methylation of H19 for both paternal and maternal allele, hence resulting in doubling the Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Igf2 codes for insulin-like growth factor 2, a protein which promotes growth, doubling its expression hence leads to tumor cells overgrowth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the drug treatment period because DNA methylation marks are mitotically heritable: once laid down in a cell, they are conserved in mitosis thanks to the DMT1 enzymes that act on hemi methylated DNA.</p>
<p>There are two periods, defined as sensitive periods, in which the cells undergo reprogramming of the Epigenome: pre implantation early development, and gametogenesis. In these periods DNA methylation is erased (at a diffrent pace and via different mechanisms, for maternal and paternal genome) and then re established.</p>
<p>Interfering with natural DNA methylation during these periods, coud then result in altering the epigenome reprogramming, hence causing over expression or underexpression of a number of genes that will extend to somatic maintainance.</p></div>
