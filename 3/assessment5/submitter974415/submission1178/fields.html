    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In normal cells</strong>, CpG islands are generally <strong>hypomethylated</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In cancer cells</strong> CpG islands are more likely to be <strong>hypermethylated</strong>.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation in cancer is found at CpG islands in the promoter of <strong>tumor suppressor</strong> genes. Tumor suppressors are thus <strong>silenced </strong>by hypermethylation of their promoter.</p>
<p>While hypermethylation at CpG islands is a general feature of cancer, <strong>hypermethylation at particular CpG islands varies by tumor type</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the Knudson hypothesis, inhibition of tumor suppressors is not enough to cause cancer. Cancer is the result of <strong>multiple hits</strong>. In the case of tumor suppressors for exemple, inactivation of <strong>one or both alleles</strong>, <strong>coupled with</strong> the activation of an <strong>oncogene</strong>, is required for cancer to happen.</p>
<p>Moreover DNA methylation, once established, is <strong>mitotically heritable</strong>. Causing epimethylated cells to reproduce faster and to be <strong>rapidly selected</strong>. This occurs because silencing of tumor suppressors ultimately favors cell growth or disrupts cell death, giving tumor cells an advantage over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a normal cell,<strong> repetitive elements</strong> and<strong> intergenic regions</strong> are generally <strong>methylated</strong>. In cancer cells, <strong>repetitive elements </strong>and<strong> intergenic regions</strong> are<strong> hypomethylated</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Genome-wide hypomethylation</strong>, while naturally occuring with <strong>time</strong>, leads to <strong>genomic instability</strong>. Thus contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation at <strong>repetitive <strong>elements or intergenic regions</strong> </strong>contributes to general genomic instability by <strong>deletion</strong>, <strong>insertion</strong> and <strong>reciprocal translocation</strong>. <strong>Hypomethylated regions</strong> are often associated to <strong>euchromatin</strong> and allow <strong>illegitimate recombination</strong> between <strong>aligning or quasi-aligning repetitive regions</strong>. Both genetic identity and open chromatin are required.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation also causes the <strong>activation</strong> of repetitive elements. They <strong>transpose</strong> and<strong> disrupt</strong> the coding region of <strong>genes </strong>they jump into. Those repetitive elements can also disrupt <strong>neighbouring genes</strong> by activating their <strong>cryptic promoter</strong>, causing <strong>aberrant transcription</strong> like in the case of the Agouti or Axin gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a good example of imprinting disruption that leads to cancer.</p>
<p>In the <strong>paternal</strong> allele of a normal cell, the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is <strong>methylated</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of this DNA methylation, the CTCF insulator is <strong>unable to bind</strong> the ICR. This <strong>allows enhancement of Igf2</strong> by downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>Moreover, DNA methylation from the ICR spreads to the promoter of H19 inhibiting its transcription.</p>
<p><strong>Igf2 is expressed</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the <strong>maternal</strong> allele of a normal cell, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is<strong> unmethylated</strong>.</p>
<p>The CTCF insulator protein is thus<strong> allowed to bind</strong> to the ICR. Consequently <strong>Igf2 is insulated</strong> from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancement of the H19 is favored</strong>. H19 is expressed.</p>
<p><strong>Igf2 is not expressed.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of <strong>Wilm's tumor</strong>, the <strong>maternal allele </strong>is<strong> hypermethylated</strong>. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Both</strong> alleles <strong></strong>behave like the <strong>paternal allele</strong>. <strong>Igf2 is overexpressed</strong> leading to a <strong>double dose</strong> of Igf2.</p>
<p>Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) codes for a major fetal<strong> growth factor</strong>. It's overexpression leads to the Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a<strong> DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor</strong> (DNMTi). It <strong>hypomethylates</strong> DNA by <strong>inhibiting DNMTs</strong> (DNA Methyltransferases).</p>
<p>Decitabine is also a <strong>nucleoside analogue</strong>. It is similar enough to nucleotides to <strong>incorporate DNA upon replication</strong>.</p>
<p>Once incorporated, Decitabine <strong>acts specifically</strong> at the <strong>replication stage</strong> by <strong>binding irreversibly to DNMT1</strong> during methylation of the duplicated strand.</p>
<p>Decitabine thus takes irreversible effect.</p>
<p>Because Decitabine <strong>needs duplication</strong> to take effect, <strong>tumor cells</strong>, which duplicate faster, are <strong>more severely</strong> and <strong>rapidly</strong> affected than healthy cells.</p>
<p>Even at very <strong>small dosage</strong>, Decitabine has <strong>very good anti-neoplastic effects</strong>.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable</strong>.</p>
<p>Consequently, drugs that alter DNA methylation have <strong>long term epigenetic effects</strong>. This is because DNMT1 conserves methylation patterns during replication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation also occur during <strong>sensitive periods of development</strong>.<strong> </strong>Those are periods of <strong>active remodeling of epigenetic marks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods</strong> happen two times during development: during <strong>germ cells developement</strong> and during <strong>early embryonic development</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation affect <strong>all cells</strong> not only cancer cells. This includes <strong>germ cells</strong> and <strong>embryonic cells</strong>.</p>
<p>For this reason <strong>younger patients</strong>, particularly those having <strong>developing germ cells</strong> should be advised <strong>not to</strong> take epigenetic treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnant women</strong>, especially during <strong>early stage of pregnancy</strong> should be advised <strong>not to</strong> take epigenetic treatments because it migh alter the epigenetic state of their <strong>embryo</strong>.</p>
<p>Treatments during sensitive periods could have severe consequences including <strong>trans-generational effects</strong>.</p>
<p>It could directly affect the epigenome of <strong>future children</strong> of <strong>young patients</strong> through <strong>germ cell epigenetic aberrations</strong>.</p>
<p>This could also affect the epigenome of <strong>children</strong> and <strong>g</strong><strong>randchildren</strong> of <strong>pregnant women</strong>, by altering DNA methylation of <strong>early embryonic cells</strong> and <strong>germ cells</strong> of their <strong>future child</strong>.</p></div>
