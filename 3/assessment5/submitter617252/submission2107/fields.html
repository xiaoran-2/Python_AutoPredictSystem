    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a Normal DNA Methylation in a Normal Cell there is hypomethylation at the CpG islands but the genome would be normally methylated in the repetitive elements  through the intergenic regions and introns of the gene but in a Cancer cell the CpGislands are more likely to be methylated and the repititive elements, intergenic regions and the introns are hypomethylated. In cancer cells the Cpg Regions before the tumor suppresor gene are hypermethylated.<span>Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes. This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.</span></p>
<p><span>The Hypomethylation consequence depend on the location where it occurs. Tumorigenesis occurs due to many epigenetic errors in cancers and these mistakes occur over the life period and this is a general rule for cancer. The cancer cell's repetative regions are less methylated when compared to a noramal cell's repetative region and this leads to genomic instabilty which further leads to abnormal karyotypes. This is because of the promethylations of cancer cell's repetative sites, intergenic regions and introns due to which the aligning,misaligning of chromosomes which result in illigitimate recombinations because the chromosomes are not densely packed into heterochromatins.</span></p>
<p><span>The hypomethylations can also cause the activations of the repeats which can make the repeats transposable around the genome where it could interupt the codding sequence and can also activate the neighbouring genes. this leads to additional deletions and insertions which leads to genomic instability</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylations in a normal cells leads to disruption of imprinting where the the genes that display aonoallelic parent of origin expression will be expressing both the paternal and maternal expression or become silent from both parental allels. This is found in cancer because most of the genes that are imprinted are involved in growth promoting or growth suppressing.</p>
<p>In normal cells the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region is methylated in the paternal allele whereas it is unmethylated on the maternal-allele.The unmethylation leads to CTCF4 bind and form insulator element i.e. the maternal allel's enhancer will act on H19 but Igf2 will not be expressed.The methylation on the paternal allele led the enhancers to act on the Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to insulate the enhancer acting on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.But due to hypermethylations there is loss of imprinting and this leads to high premethylation of the imprint control region on both paternal &amp; maternal allele and If2 is expressed on the maternal allele &amp; there is double dosage of Igf2 which is a growth promoter and this is related to Wilm's Tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug which is sold as Dacogen by Eisai a Japanese company is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursors of myelogenous leukemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methy transferase. It can be incorparated into DNA strands</p>
<p>.Decitabine when exposed to tumour cells induces an anti tumour memory responce, including the subpopulation of cancer-stem like cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation can cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes. Also DNA methylation changes are passed from one generation to another and the DNA methylations are Epigenetic changes. Altering the DNA methylation will pass on the altered DNA methylation for generations and this can cause enduring effect on the epigenome These changes are passed on from one generation to another until it is actively removed. Once these changes are removed they do not return so De Stephen Baylin belives that if cancer's growth can be stoped without having to kill all of its cell by removing epigenetic changes which cause cancer.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during Developmental and rehabilitation crisis. the sensitive periods would include the final stages of the cancer or the initial stages of the tumour genesis. it would be <span>inadvisable to treat during these 2 periods because in the initial period where the tumour is just starting to multiply addition of the drug would spark the division of tumor or damage the surrounding area intensively and in the final stages of tumour it might cause the body to malfunction or would have no effect at all</span></p></div>
