    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in promoter of tumour suppressor genes. In normal cells CpG island is unmethylated and hypermethylated in cancer cells. Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence tumour suppressor in all tumors. Different tumours have different set of methylation and CpG island methylation progresses with time.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity and stability. In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated which lead to genomic instability (deletion, translocation, insertion, duplication).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region of paternal allele is methylated and CTCF can no longer bind. Enhancers are free to bind to Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression. H19 long noncoding RNA promoter is methylated and thus silenced.</p>
<p>The imprinting control region of maternal allele is unmethylated and bound to CTCF which is an insulator protein that insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers and thus Igf2 is silenced because of H19 activation.</p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to disease known as Beckwith syndrome. This disruption lead to problems with both Kncq1 and Igf2/H19 expression and also Cdkn1 which is tumour suppressor. This disruption lead to appearance of 2 paternal alleles witch mean too much Igf2 and on Cdkn1 expression and so not inhibiting the growth. This because of mutation or deletion within this region and cause loose of imprinting (uniperental disomy). This lead to fetal or post-natal overgrowth,macroglossia and pridisposition of embryonic tumours</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour( chilid tumour but not adult tumour) is due to loose of imprinting and over expression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is division dependent and that mean cancer cell are more severely affected because they are replicated more. Decitabine cause DNA demethylation. Very high doses of Decitabineis is toxic and nonspecific and not good to get rid of cancer because they are not acting on the range that they cause DNA demethylation and low doses have good Anti-neoplastic effect because they are causing DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells. When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. By this process of demethylation by Decitabine , normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is period of development when the epigenetic markers are deleted and re-sited again.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are during germ cell development and during early development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the epigenetic markers are re-sited in this period and methylation and acetylation patterns are differentiating.</p></div>
