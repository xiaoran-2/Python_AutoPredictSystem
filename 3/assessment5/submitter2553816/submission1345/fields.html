    <div class="field-value"><p>  Normally CpG islands are relatively free of methylation compared with the rest of the chromatin. Methylation is generally associated with silencing of genes and is found in especially high concentrations in the dense heterochromatin of the nucleus.  In contrast, CpG islands are areas of high activity. Methylated CpG islands are associated with cancer. This pattern disrupts normal replication, resulting in derangements that cause disease because these areas that are normally active are now silent.</p>
<p>  Intergenic regions of chromatin normally are methylated at repetitive elements. This may prevent competition with other sites, such as CpG islands, that are normally active in healthy conditions. In cancer, repetitive elements in intergenic regions become hypomethylated. This means that genes that should be silent can now be active, resulting in derangement of transcription. Together the reversal of the methylation pattern, (i.e. the migration of methyl epigenetic moities to CpG islands from intergenic regions and repetitive elements) creates a truly pathological biochemical state that causes disease conditions.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia. It removes excessive epigenetic methyl markers, thereby decreasing the silencing of genes that should be active under normal conditions, perhaps such as tumor suppressor genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic marks are transmitted through mitosis to daughter cells through many generations of cell replication. A sensitive period is one in which the epigenetic marks are in a state of flux. The sensitive periods are during gametogenesis, during early embryonic development, and also during artificially-induced creation of stem cells from mature cells. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the result is not predictable. Interfering with the epigenetic changes that are going on at ths time could be disastrous, having profound and/or far-reaching effects, such as major mutations, death, or sterility.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During imprinting, parental epigenetic patterns are erased. Methylation on the paternal allele reaches its lowest point only six hours after fertilization and that of the maternal allele during the blastocyte stage. Another imprinting period, also marked by a drop in methylation on both alleles, occurs in mid-gestation, when primordial germ cells of the embryo develop. Methylation is not necessarily associated with gene silencing during imprinting, but rather its effect varies among genes. The imprint control region associated with H19 and Igf2 in the paternal allele becomes methylated and this silences nearly all gene expression from the father. In Wilm's disease (embryonic/childhood cancer of the kidney, seen in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), the methylation pattern of the two alleles is such that both resemble the paternal allele. Cause may be mutation, deletion, epigenetic abnormalities, or uniparental disomy. The result is that a tumor suppressor gene is silenced, but Ig2, an oncogene, is not.  This leaves Ig2  free to create unrestricted growth: cancer, macroglossia, and general overgrowth. Disordered imprinting is commonly associated with cancer, perhaps because growth genes are so active at this time.</p>
