    <h1>Submission 877 from Anon (session_user_id: e683873de489818f3b17570b84ef733b7ab2d671)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, or a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is one of 4 FDA approved epigenetic drugs, and is currently approved for use in myodysplastic syndromes that have progressed to AML. It binds very tightly to DNMTs (irreversibly), and thus doesn't allow hypermethylation, since DNMT is one ofthe factors necessary for DNA methylation to take place. Cancer is characterized by hypermethylation of of DNA that causes the tumor-suppressing genes to not be expressed, since DNA methylation is a repressive epigenetic mark. This, paired with hypomethylation of oncogenes, generally allows cells to grow uncontrollably, encouraged by the oncogenes, and unstoppable by the silenced tumor-suppressors , forming a cancerous tumor that has the dangerous ability to metastasize (spread to and infect other tissues). However, Decitabine, which would selectively demethylate the tumor-suppressor gene, frees it from repressive methylation and allows it to be expressed, hindering tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal human epigenotype, CpG islands (regions with a large occurrence of CpG dinucleotides), when methylated, correspond to a silencing of gene expression. In cancer, however, DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in a most abnormal fashion. These CpG islands, and their neighboring regions 2kb away (shores) are frequently hypermethylated. In fact, this phenomenon is so common in cancerous cells, it occurs more frequently that genetic mutations! This hypermethylation deactivated many crucial tumor-suppressing cellular pathways, such as apoptosis (programmed cell death), DNA repair, and other tumor-suppressing factors. This results in the inability of the cell to cope with the frequent division, and it cannot control the growth of the cell, contributing to disease.</p>
<p>In a normal human epigenotype, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. This prevents transposition of the repetitive elements, that have a tendency to switch locations in the genome, and helps maintain genomic instability by preventing illegitamate recombination of the chromosomes. The methylation of these regions is viable for life, as knockout studies have shown (of DNMT1, a necessary element in DNA methylation.) In cancer, the alteration of DNA methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of those that promote growth. This alteration is one of the things that makes cancer so effective, as the body's genes to fight against it have been silenced by methylation, and the genes to increase it have been overexpressed. Hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and the intergenic intervals also creates genomic instability that can induce mutations.</p>
<p>Thusly, cells in a cancerous state have methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements that has been altered, promoting cancer and disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, on a paternal cell, the Igf2 is expressed, and is not methylated, while on the other hand, in the maternal cell, H19 is generally expressed and unmethylated. In addition, several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele, encouraging growth. However, on the maternal allele, these sites are not methylated, suppressing growth. This sex-specific genomic imprinting is important, as two parental cells that encourage growth could lead to rapid, uncontrolled growth and consequently, cancer.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster. The maternal epigenotype switches, and becomes that of the paternal. Now, both the maternal and patternal epigenomes have a methylated H19 with an unmethylated Igf2, as well as a methylated neighborhood around the H19 gene. This leads to a loss of imprinting, since there is no longer just the one copy of the allele's expression. Since both copies encourage growth, the cell develops Wilm's tumor as a result of the disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>This is one way in with disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 gene cluster can contribute significantly to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an example of an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. It is preserved through a process involving hemi-methylated DNA being recognized by DNMT1, that lays down DNA methylation on the opposite strand of corresponding unmethylated DNA. So DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome.</p>
<p>To allow totipotency from generation to generation, cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming, the wiping away of  epigenetic marks. During these periods, the epigenotype is more vulnerable and  prone to mutations and changes from the environment or from other sources. For this reason, these periods, where the DNA is actively being remodelled, and where intrinsic and extrinsic factors have the greatest effect on a person, are referred to as "senstitive periods".</p>
<p>The 2 different waves of epigenetic reprogramming, occurring during primordial germ cell development and early development are sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients with such epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because, during these intervals, the patients are more likely to be affected in a long-lasting manner, and DNA methylation could have a permanent effect on the patient. Thusly, using drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods is not advised, as it could have many long-term effects.</p></div>
