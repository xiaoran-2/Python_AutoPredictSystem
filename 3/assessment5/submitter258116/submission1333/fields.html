    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In the normal cells DNA methylation have two main functions: control of gene expression and maintain genomic stability. Both are abnormal in cancer cells.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands, often found at gene promoters, are mostly tend to be unmethylated in normal cells. Methylation of CpG islands located at gene promoter leads to inactivation of corresponding  gene. Talking about CpG island methylation in cancer cells, we need to say about overall changes in DNA methylation pattern changes. In cancer cells DNA methylation of whole genome is lowering, but </span><span>occurrence rate of methylated CpG islands is much higher</span><span>. It is known as a </span><span>C</span><span>pG </span><span>I</span><span>sland </span><span>M</span><span>ethylation </span><span>P</span><span>henotype (</span><span>CIMP</span><span>). Especially </span><span>CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes promoters</span><span> are tend to be methylated resulting in cancer behavior. On the other hand, CpG poor promoters that are methylated at normal cells can be unmethylated in tumor cells, for example oncogenes (R-RAS) or miRNA, suppressing tumor suppressor (miR21). I want to mention that not only CpG island methylation occurs in tumor cells, but methylation of CpG island shores (~2kb up and downstream around CpG island) too. And it is cancer biomarker too. </span></p>
<p><span><span>As I mentioned earlier, overall levels of DNA methylation are lower in cancer cells and this leads to consequent aberration in second major function of DNA methylation - stability maintenance. Stability function is achieved by methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. While methylated, repeats can not  be copied and so can't result in genome corruption. Also some data is present that DNA methylation at gene body protects from wrong start site binding or antisense transcription. When normal levels of DNA methylation in cancer cells is lowered thus lowering of intergenic and gene body methylation. Exempt from methylation repetitive elements begin to "jump" through genome resulting in crucial gene corruption and further cancer behavior establishment.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Imprinted genes (with parent of origin expression) are often known to be located in clusters, controlled by </span><span>I</span><span>mprint </span><span>C</span><span>ontrol </span><span>R</span><span>egion. Looking at Igf2/H19 cluster ICR is methylated at the paternal allele, resulting in block of CTCF insulator binding thus enhancers, located downstream of ICR are activating Igf2 expression. Methylation of ICR at paternal allele is also spread to H19 promoter, inactivating it's expression. At maternal allele ICR is not methylated, then CTCF blocks Igf2 from enhancement and enhancers activate H19 expression. In different types of cancer different changes at ICR's are known. Many of imprinted genes are associated with growth promotion and it is the case for Igf2/H19. Particular at Wilm's tumor imprinting at Igf2/H19 cluster is disrupted: both maternal and paternal alleles </span><span>have ICR methylated </span><span>resulting in Igf2 overexpression. I should mention, that in other ICR's not only hypermethylation may occur, but hypomethylation too. So type of disruption depends on genes in imprinted cluster and tumor type. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Deciatbine is one of antitumor drugs approved by FDA. It belongs to class of DNMT inhibitors. Mostly DNMTi are nucleoside analogues and are incorporated in the DNA while replicating. After this DNMT comes across this nucleoside to copy Me - mark on the daughter strand, but it's deadlocked thus mark is not established. This mechanism results in passive DNA demethylation. Tumor cells are dividing in very high rate in comparison to normal cells. Concrete mechanism of action is not clear enough, but it should be correlated with erasure of epigenetic marks crucial for tumor cells.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Dr.  Baylin combined treatment with DNMT inhibitors with HDACi. The long lasting effects, in my opinion, should be consequence of DNMTi. Demethylation, caused by drug, can result in activation of some of tumor suppressors or inactivation of some of significant, but not crucial for cancer cell genes. Thus epigenetic changes may not kill, but make tumor more susceptible to common therapy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Modern epigenetic drugs have little data on what middle and long term side effects they may lead to, but it is obvious that intervention in ubiquitous mechanism of DNA methylation lay down will cause some changes in future. Especially when this drugs are applied during sensitive periods of development. Sensitive period is time when epigenetic state of the organism is strongly changed. The main two are as follows: embryonic development and germ cells development. At sensitive period the process of epigenetic marks lay down occurs and so the major side effects of therapy will be present.</span></p></div>
