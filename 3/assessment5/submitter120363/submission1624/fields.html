    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally methylation at CpG islands is usually pretty low, hence the genes downstream of that CpG island are more accessible since the DNA is loosely packed. Which in effect allows for transcription of those genes and ultimately produces proteins that are coded by those genes. In cancer however, CpG islands are hypermethylated especially for Tumor Suppressor Genes(TSGs). This hypermethylation of TSGs allows for the cancer cells to escape Apoptosis and other DNA repair motifs making it crucial for cancer proliferation. Intergenic regions and repetetitive elements are normally methylated so they are tightly packed in the heterochromatin, but in cancer the DNA is hypomethylated genome-wide. This hypomethylation usually results in loss of genomic stability and creates a favorable environment for oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is mitotically hertiable so it gets passed on to the daughter cells through cell division. DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors like Decitabine lock DNMT to the methylated part of the genome that the DNMT was trying to bind to(so that it can copy that methylation profile to the daughter cells). This is a viable way to treat cancer because it effectively blocks the signal to pass on the hypermethylation motif to the daugther cells. It is advisable to avoid using these DNA methylation altering drugs on younger patients to avoid the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. During these sensitive periods of primordial germ cell development and preimplantation and postimplantation the epigenome is actively remodeled (removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks). Applying these DNA methylation altering drugs during the sensitive periods will severely alter the enivronment for proper development and the methylation marks will not be laid out properly so the patient's lifespan will be shortened. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor. It inhibits the proper function of DNMT which is in charge of reading the methylation pattern of the DNA so that it can replace them on the daughter cells. Decitabine achieves this by locking DNMT to the methylated part of the genome that the DNMT was trying to bind to in the first place. This in effect does not allow for the methylation pattern to be inherited by the daughter cells. In cancer Tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated and Decitiabine effectively blocks this hypermethylation from being passed on the the daughter cells, causing the TSGs to be active in the daughter cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/lgf2 cluter the imprint control region is unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal allele. The unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele allows for binding by CTCF  which insulates Igf2. The insulation of Igf2 allows for the enhancers to increase H19 expression. The methylation of ICR in the paternal allele blocks the binding of CTCF. The DNA methylation therefore spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and therefore the enhancers can then access lgf2 to activate it. In Wilm's tumor there is hypermethylation in the ICR on the material allele as well as the preexisting methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele. This hypermethylation causes Igf2 to be expressed in both the paternal allele and the maternal allele. The double dose of the growth promoting Igf2 promotes tumorigenesis.</p></div>
