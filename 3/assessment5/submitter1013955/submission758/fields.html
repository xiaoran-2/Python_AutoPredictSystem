    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands on chromosomes contain several non-coding CpG’s and are sites where histone signals that can turn regions on or off, they can also cause transcription to skip necessary genes because a promotor activates another section of genetic material. CpG islands are often found near promoters of active genes where they can open up chromatin that codes for proteins. In cancer they can become hypermethylated and this can even silence a nearby gene by disrupting the pattern of promoter activity.  There may be a reversal in the pattern of hypomethylation and hypermethylation which destabilizes the DNA, preventing synthesis of essential proteins and transcribing non-sense DNA instead. In normal cells intragenic areas and repetitive elements are both methylated, leaving CpG islands unmethylated so that the coding regions that follow them can be "read". This can be reversed in cancer so CpG islands are methylated and intragenic areas and repetitive elements are open. Tumour suppression areas become less available to be read and growth promoting areas get promoted in cancerous cells. The order and stability of the genome is compromised in such a way that the cancerous cell becomes alienated from its genetic programming and other healthy cells in the tissue. Normal cell differentiation is destabilized.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modelling is reversible, which is key to developing new drugs for cancer therapy. Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It works as a DNA-demethylating agent on CpG islands that have become hypermethylated and so reduce acessibility of chromatin to transcription factors. Specific cell formatting by epigenetic markers is damaged by cancer. Decitabine is used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, which can develop into acute myelogenous leukaemia, a blood cancer. Inhibitors such as Decitabine are small molecules that are able to target and bind specific modifiers on histones to disable their function. Tumours must be actively growing to be most vulnerable to inhibitor drug therapy, which can bind and replicate as cells grow in a solid tumour. It can be used if other therapies have failed and improves the lives of sufferers because side effects are less severe for these older patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modification is passed mitotically on to daughter cells during cell division, so beneficial effects of a drug continue to work without damaging cell tissue and healthy cells can outcompete the tumour. This therapy is more beneficial to the patient than injesting toxic drugs that destroys healthy cells as well as cancer also toxic side-effects debilitate patients. Sensitive periods are those during early embryo development when DNA is subject to the chromatin remodelling, removing and replacing genetic markers in imprinting, in the germ cells with maternal and paternal markers, transcription silencing and activation (for example during adolescence or pregnancy), and in tissue development where histone markers can turn key proteins on or off. Interfering with epigenetic markers during sensitive periods could cause cellular disruption that would have ripple effects from mitotic inheritance of those changes and may permanently alter the phenotypic expression of an individual and irreversibly damage their development. Epigenetic interference can cause lethal damage in placental or embryonic development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation patterns in the germ cells are set up through imprinting. Even though most histone marks are removed during early stages of embryo development, some imprinting is heritable and can be reset for the following two generations. This case is diffucult to prove in humans because of many different environmental pressures, and the impossibility of using control groups. Our chromosomes are inherited, one from each parent, females receive one copy of X from maternal DNA and one from paternal. Males inherit the Y chromosome paternally. A balance of cell products is set by epigenetic markers that can be imprinted for the maternal or paternal copy. Genetic competition for resources during gestation evolved into paternal imprinting to favour the mother devoting maximal effort towards "his" offspring, yet the mother needs to conserve her resources for future offspring, so maternal imprinting works in her defence (source Wikipedia). Cancer often causes imprinting loss in control regions for growth promoters, either hyper or hypomethylation. In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele does not express H19 due to methylation, instead enhancers promote nearby lgf2 on both maternal and paternal alleles, so lgf2 product is doubled and disrupts cell balance.</p></div>
