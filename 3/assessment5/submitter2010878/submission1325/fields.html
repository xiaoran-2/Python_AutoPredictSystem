    <h1>Submission 1325 from Anon (session_user_id: e53979a3c07004c411d27d86fcd5b521324824a6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. It's a nucleoside analog that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into the DNA, and therefore are replication dependent. It acts as a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, therefore leading to hypomethylation. Recently it was found that lower doses are effective in reducing DNA methylation, and thus the drug can be used in tumors where heavy methylation is described in the pathogenesis or poor prognosis. This is the case of myelodysplastic syndrome. Decitabine can restore the expression of tumor supressor genes whose supression by hypermethylation of CpG islands lead to the development of the neoplasia.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation pattern is mitotically heritable, through maintenance mechanisms mediated by DNMT1. Once the pattern of one single dividing cell is altered, all lines that are originated from further divisions will retain that same altered pattern. Therefore, a drug that was administered for a short period and changed methylation of a cell would retain the effect even after being discontinued. Besides silencing gene expression, methylation can also direct changes in other epigenetic marks, like histone acetylation or methylation, which can also supress or enhance gene expression. All these alterations in the epigenome and gene expression might enhance the response to other chemoterapeutic agents. During the life cycle, there are periods where existing epigenetic marks are removed and rebuilt, which is called epigenetic reprogramming. They are <span>sensitive to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.</span> These sensitive periods occur in the first days of embrionic development (8-10 days), and during gametogenesis. Treating cancer patients during these periods is inadvisable, since epigenetic drugs act on the machinery that is responsible for the reprogramming, and thus might alter key events of the development that would last for a lifetime.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are sites where there is a high frequency of CG dinucleotides. They are found in about 60% of promoters, and their methylation inactivates the gene. Usually, CpG islands are kept free of methylation independent of the activity state of the gene. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. Besides the CpG island, methylation can be widened to regions of approximately 2 kb regions surrounding it, which are called CpG island shores. The hypermethylation causes the silencing of the underlying gene, and targets are generally tumor supressor genes, that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Thus, the inactivation of these genes leads to disruption of the normal cell cycle, immortality or lack of mutagenesis control, which are hallmarks in the pathogenesis of cancer.</p>
<p>Besides CpG islands, DNA can also be methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Intergenic regions are located between genes, and are believed to contain regulatory elements (like promoters and enhancers) and to express non-coding RNAs. Methylation of these regions is important to fine control gene expression. Repetitive elements are unstable genomic regions, that can lead to aberrant recombination or jump throughout the genome (transposition), to then disrupt the code of other genes or induce their activation by acting like a cryptic promoter. Therefore, methylation is crucial to inactivate these sites and maintain genome stability. In the normal cell, both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated, but in cancer cells, they are hypomethylated. This can cause insertions, deletions or reciprocal translocations, with the net result of chromosomal instability.</p>
<p>Finally, both CpG island hypermethylation and intergenic regions/repeat hypomethylation increase progressively in the development of cancer. The final role of DNA methylation is dependent on where there is predominant inactivation of tumor supressors or chromosomal instability in the development of the tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the phenomenon where some genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner. Imprinting is controlled by ICRs, DNA sequences that control the expression of several genes nearby, forming a cluster. The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed by the H19 and Igf2 genes, the ICR and some enhancer regions. When demethylated, the regulatory protein CTCF binds the ICR, and thus disrupts the access of the enhancers to the Igf2 gene, therefore reducing its expression. On the other way, the CTCF allows the enhancers to drive the expression of the H19 gene. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and thus CTCF does not bind the ICR and Igf2 expression is increased. In the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated, and thus Igf2 expression is decreased. In Wilm's tumor, there is loss of imprinting at the maternal allele, such as the maternal allele ICR is methylated. Therefore, the maternal allele expresses Igf2, resulting in the transcription of a double dose of the Igf2 protein. Since Igf2 is involved in growth control, its overexpression leads to the development of a tumour.</p></div>
