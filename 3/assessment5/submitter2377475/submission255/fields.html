    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Ordinarily, the majority of CpG islands are hypomethylated (or unmethylated).  In cancerous cells, those CpG islands have become methylated, functionally silencing downstream genes.  Because the CpG islands are frequently found in the promotor regions of tumor suppressor genes, the silencing caused by hypermethylation may cause or contribute to the growth of the cancer.  Moreover, this epigenetic silencing is mitotically heritable by all future generations of the cancer cells, perpetuating the cancerous phenotype of the cell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic and repetitive elements in normal cells are hypermethylated (or heavily methylated) in normal tissues, but are hypomethylated in cancer cells.   Methylation at repetitive elements helps stabilize the genome, for example by preventing inappropriate recombination of chromosomes.  Removal of those methyl groups increases genomic instability.  The deletions, insertions of reciprocal translocations which may result may damage or inhibit tumor suppressing genes, for example.  Alternatively, alterations to the genes could duplicate or remove inhibition on oncogenes, leading to cancer.  Additionally, decreased methylation of poor (or weak) promotors may remove some epigenetic inhibition.  This can lead to activation of previously silent genes, or enhancement of genes which were previously only mildly active.  If these genes turn out to be oncogenes, tumor growth might result.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the H19/IGF imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele.  This methylaation prevents binding of CTCF to the insulator element, allowing the enhancers to act on the IGF coding region and increase IGF expression.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The maternal allele is not methylated, so CTCF does bind to the insulator element, preventing the enhancers from acting on IGF and leading them to increase expression of H19 from these allele instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region on BOTH alleles.  Effectively, they are both imprinted as "paternal" alleles, and there is no "maternal" allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This disrupted imprinting results in an overexpression of IGF, as there are now two alleles making this contribution, and no HG19.  IGF is growth promoting, possibly contributing to the out of control tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that specifically targets DNMTi by irreversably binding to the active site of this methyl transferase.  By preventing DNMTi from adding methyl groups to the DNA strand, over many cell divisions there is an overall loss of DNA methylation.  One of the hallmarks of cancer cells is a hypermethylation of certain areas of the genome (particularly the CpG islands in the promotor regions of growth regulating genes). Returning these CpG islands back to a hypomethylated state would effectively revert the cancerous phenotype of the effected cells back towards a more typical one.  While not a full cure, it might slow the growth significantly, or leave the cancer more vulnerable to combination treatments with other chemotherapies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The first thing we learned about epigenetic markers in this course is that they are mitotically heritable.  This means that however they are established in the mother cell, they are passed reliably from mother cell to daughter cells.  By rendering one cancer cell "more vulnerable", as Dr. Baylin puts it, to chemotherpies, we also make all the progeny of that medically altered cell more vulnerable...even after the epigenetic therapy has ended.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>That same fidelity with which epigenetic marks are passed from mother to daughter cell means we must be careful about which patients we administer these drugs to.  During sensitive periods of development, when epigenetic marks which were cleared in the course of normal development are being re-established, administration of substances which alter the cell's ability to make those marks may cause more problems than it solves.  Particularly we should be careful during the period immediately after blostocyst formation when previously cleared epigenetic marks are being reestablished, and during maturation of the germ cells.  Administration of such drugs at these times would make it impossible for appropriate marks to be established, a situation that we know can lead to a number of disease states and developmental disorders.</p></div>
