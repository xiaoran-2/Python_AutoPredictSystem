<p>nmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called <em><a title="CpG islands" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_islands">CpG islands</a></em>, which are present in the 5' <a title="Regulatory regions" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_regions">regulatory regions</a> of many <a title="Genes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genes">genes</a>. In many disease processes, such as <a title="Cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a>, gene promoter <a title="CpG island" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CpG_island">CpG islands</a> acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in <a title="Transcriptional silencing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptional_silencing">transcriptional silencing</a> that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. <strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>he normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands occurrs when</strong> the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes.</p>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands </strong>is that the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. They're not all methylated, but their more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell. It's recognized that DNA methylation and, consequent epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes can be, indeed, one of the, these hits.  CpG island hypermethylation, an associated gene silencing, occurs really frequently in tumors.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease </strong>when the CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. So, if you think about the way that a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes, it could do so genetically, or it could happen epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in acyl in active state.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements </strong>occur <span class="mw-headline">due to their regulatory functions, although they were once thought of as just "junk Genes".  </span></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline"> </span> </h2>
<p><strong>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease </strong>because of the hypermethylation of CpG islands associated with tumor suppressors. It is the most common type of hypermethylation found in tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

<p><strong>The methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status </strong>is H19 is only transcribed from the maternally inherted allele; the paternal H19 allele is not expressed.</p>
<p><strong>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour </strong>because the <em>H19</em> gene has a possible tumor suppressor function.<strong>          </strong></p>
<p><strong>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease </strong>has been recently reported that the <em>H19</em> gene may act as an oncogene in studies using human cells maintained in culture and injected into mice to produce tumors.         <strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,  </strong>with reference to effects on the epigenome - in the following way -</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In analogy to genetic mutation, tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation during tumor progression and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation has proven useful for tumor classification of different tumor types.</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to are identified as follows, (1) Zolinza (vorinostat; suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, SAHA). Nonselective, micromolar potent, (2) Istodax (romidepsin) (formerly FK228) Selective for class I HDACs; nanomolar potent, (3) CI-994, (4) (<em>N</em>-acetyldinaline, also tacedinaline)  , Belinostat (PXD101). Hydroxamic acid-type  </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation </strong>is that it may decrease DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </p>
<p><strong>     </strong></p>
<p><strong>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour </strong>because Decitabine can lower blood cells that help your body fight infections and help your blood to clot, which could cause you to get an infection.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment  are </strong>There are no known periods of development that one would avoid treating patients with such drugs</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>The altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome </strong>due to its a methyl deficient which leads to a decrease in DNA methylation.<strong>       </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong></p>
<p><strong>The sensitive period </strong> is difficult to pin down. The Understanding sensitivity is perhaps even more pressing than understanding resistance. Cancer researchers remain puzzled about why many therapies work when they do work (why are testicular cancer and pediatric leukemia so curable?). <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/15/12/3938.full">http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/15/12/3938.full</a>    <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The sensitive periods of development  </strong>is the initial Drug delivery period and may cause Reduction of DNA methylation may turnback on expression of genes down-regulated by hypermethylation,including tumor suppressor genes &amp; genes required for apoptosis.<strong>  <a href="http://www.aacrmeetingabstracts.org/cgi/content/abstract/2006/1/382">http://www.aacrmeetingabstracts.org/cgi/content/abstract/2006/1/382</a></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable </strong>because scientists, researchers and clinicians site that epigenetic side-effects of pharmaceuticals may be involved in the etiology of heart disease, cancer, neurological and cognitive disorders, obesity, diabetes, infertility, and sexual dysfunction<strong>. <a href="http://www.wellnessresources.com/studies/many_drugs_cause_adverse_epigenetic_changes">http://www.wellnessresources.com/studies/many_drugs_cause_adverse_epigenetic_changes</a></strong></p>
