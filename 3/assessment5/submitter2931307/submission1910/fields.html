    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">1) The normal cell is hypomethylated at the CpG islands.  </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">2) In contrast, almost all tumors have CpG islands hypermethylated. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The hypermethylation of the tumor supressors genes promoters CpG islands is a general characteristic in cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Aditionally the CpG island methylation progresses with time. </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">As DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, the silencing tumor suppressor epimutations can be selected rapidly because the epimutated-cells have competitive advantage over the non-epimutated cells in the surrounding tissues.</span></p>
<p>Also it is important to say that the DNA methylation profiles are unique to each of the particular genosubtypes.  </p>
<p>3) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The silencing a tumor supressive gene via hypermethylation can do the same job as </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">mutation. For example in the retinoblastoma gene hypermethylation and DNA methylation of the MLH1 markers in colorectal cancer, in Lynch syndrome.</span></p>
<p>In general we have the silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">(Melanie R. Hasslera,  and Gerda Eggera, Epigenomics of cancer – emerging new concepts Biochimie. 2012 November; 94(11): 2219–2230)</span></p>
<p>4) The genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes.</p>
<p>5) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In contrast, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer are hypomethylated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">6) </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The hypomethylation of the repeats leads to their activation, so they have the capacity to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">That can lead to transcriptional aberration in the surrounding regions of the repeats.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The outcome could be: additional deletions in cancer, insertions even reciprocal translocations.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In general genomic instability.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) <span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In the paternal allele the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and because of that the insulator protein CTCF doesn’t bind ICR. CTCF doesn’t insulate Igf2 and then the enhancers are free to access to Igf2, so Igf2 is express for the paternal allele. H19 is not express because the methylation of ICR is spread to H19. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">2) In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, and is bind by the insulator protein CTCF. CTCF insulates Igf2.  Because of that, the enhancers act on H19 and not on Igf2. That enhances the expression of H19. And Igf2 is silent for the maternal allele. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">3) </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The loss of imprinting leads to hypomethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele. That means having two paternal-like alleles.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele leads to a double dose of Igf2 (growth promoting) in comparison to the normal cell. And no expression of Cdkn1c (growth inhibitor).</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">4) </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">We have expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele leading to a double dose of Igf2 (growth promoting) in comparison to the normal cell. And no expression of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor gene). This is associated with Wilm's tumour.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and is approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to cute myeloid leukemia. </p>
<p>2) Decitabine causes DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>3) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Because decitabine is division dependent the cancer cells -which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body- will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.</span></p>
<p>That leads to DNA demethylation in the tumor cells.  Maybe that’s the reason it is most effective in myelodysplastic syndrome which is dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because those alteration are mitotic heritable.</span></p>
<p>It is possible the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes. </p>
<p>2) A sensitive period is a period of active reprogramming, active remodeling of the epigenome. </p>
<p>3) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The sensitive periods of development are:</span></p>
<p>The period of primordial germ cell  development through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the pre-implanted and early post implantation period. </p>
<p>4) <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the sensitive periods changes in the environment (even changes to the diet) can influence the epigenome in a permanent way and even (maybe) induce transgenerational epigenetic through the gametes.</span></p>
<p>It is possible that the environment changes in sensitive periods (ECSP) leads (in some cases) to the disruption of epigenetic reprogramming inducing to imprinting disorders (for example it is possible that imprinting disorders arise more frequently in children that are born from assisted reproductive technologies because of ECSP)</p>
<p>Therefore treating patients during sensitive periods could leads to imprinting disorders or another kind of prejudicial epigenetic alteration.  </p>
