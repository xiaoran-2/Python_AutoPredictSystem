    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic event which is implicated in the regulation of the expression of genes. This phenomenon is usually involved in down-regulation of certain genes when affects to the CpG islands of promoters; however, DNA methylation doesn't always mean expression repression.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, while in tumor cells they're hypermethylated because of a certain pattern of epigenetic changes which are mitotically heritable. The methylation of CpG islands affects moreover to the tumor suppressor genes, which are implicated in the control of the cell cycle and regulate, among other processes, the programed cell death of the abnormal cell, so this allows the tumor cell to divide and proliferate without any control. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, however, the epigenetic pattern differences between the normal and healthy cells and the tumor cells are just the opposite: normal cells are hypermethylated in those regions, while tumor cells remain hypomethylated. The methylation of these regions is associated with the maintenance of the genome stability, so a hypomethylation at this level would mean a higher risk of accumulating mutations as translocations, deletions or insertions in those cells due to the dissolution of the packed heterochromatin, which could have important consequences in a prognostic or therapeutic point of view.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can also affect to the Imprinted Control Regions (ICRs), which are regions of the genome implicated in the regulation of the expression of the imprinted alleles of a concrete gene, which may differ depending of the paternal or maternal origin of that allele. Some imprinted genes are related with the expression of growth promoters or restrictors, so the epigenetic modifications at this level could enhance or reduce the growth of the cell. For example, the expression of the insulin growth factor 2 (igf2) is different in both alleles: while in the paternal allele the ICR of this cluster is hypermethylated and that allows the enhancers to promote the expression of igf2; in the maternal allele the ICR remains hypomethylated, so that permits the enhancers to express H19 instead of igf2. The hypermethylation of the ICR of the igf2 cluster in the maternal allele brings about the overexpression of igf2 in a double measure, and this phenomenon is related to the early development of the Wilm's tumor. The overexpression of igf2 could promote the pre-neoplastic cells to divide and proliferate more aggressivly and, finally, to culminate in a malignant tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug whose target is the inhibition of the DNA methyltransferase. It is a nucleotid analog whose mechanism of action is to insert into the DNA strain and to inhibit the DNMT when it binds to its substrate in such a way that the methylation of the DNA cannot occur. This process brings about a DNA hypomethylation which can be very useful for those types of tumors whose development depends moreover of the repression of tumor suppresor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic outcome which is mitotically heritable. This means that the daugher cells would present the same epigenetic pattern in the next generation that its mother cells. Inhibiting the DNA methylation of tumor cells may make them to have their DNA less packaged and to express certain genes, and, then, to be more susceptible to traditional chemotherapy. However, these kind of drugs are not recommended to young people because of the sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming. These sensitive periods refer to a period of time when the epigenome is more sensitive to be modified, and it comprises the primordial germ cell development and the spermatogenesis and ovogenesis. Due to the fact that epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and persist over time after then, this period of time is crucial and it its long-term consequences remain unclear at the moment.</p></div>
