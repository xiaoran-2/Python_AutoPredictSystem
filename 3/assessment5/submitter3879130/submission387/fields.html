    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic inactivation of genes that are crucial for the control of normal cell growth is a hallmark of cancer cells. DNA methylation is one of the most commonly occurring epigenetic events taking place in the mammalian genome. DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription. Alterations in DNA methylation are common in a variety of tumors as well as in development. DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification, resulting in the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring. Even though most cytosine methylation occurs in the sequence context 5′CG3′ (also called the CpG dinucleotide). Between 60% and 90% of all CpGs are methylated in mammals. DNA methylation is brought about by a group of enzymes known as the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene Several transcription factors, including AP-2, c-Myc/Myn, the cyclic AMP-dependent activator CREB, E2F, and NFkB, recognize sequences that contain CpG residues, and binding of each has been shown to be inhibited by methylation. Second:  methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBD proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodelling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed heterochromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer. Repetitive elements is a common findingin human malignancies, gene-associated CpG islands are the targetsof hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a reversible epigenetic process that  leads to the silencing of either a maternal or paternal allele. This have a profound effect on gene transcription and cell's phenotype.The mouse <em>Igf2</em> and <em>H19</em> genes lie 70-kb apart on chromosome7 and are reciprocally imprinted. Two regulatory regions are important for their parental allele-spedfic expression: a differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream of <em>H19</em> and a set of tissue-specific enhancers downstream of <em>H19</em>. The enhancers specifically activate <em>Igf2</em> on the paternal chromosome and <em>H19</em> on maternal chromosome. The interactions between the enhancers and the genes are regulated by the DMR:  methylated DMR on the paternal chromosome inactivates adjacent <em>H19</em> and unmethylated DMR on the maternal chromosome insulates <em>Igf2</em> from the enhancers. These processes appear to involve methyl-CpG-binding proteins, histone deacetylases and  formation of chromatin insulator complexes. The <em>Igf2/H19</em> region provides a unique model in which to study the roles of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in regulation of chromosome domains.Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region(ICR) result in reciprocal changes in IGF2-H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It inhibit the expression of the de novo DNA methylating enzymes DNMT3B</p>
<p>It  is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and is under investigation for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other malignancies. Decitabine can reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation, a frequent event in all types of cancer. Because this epigenetic change is reversible, it is a good target for Decitabine therapy.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, play a very important role in both leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis. Because these epigenetic changes are very prominent in cancer cells and are reversible, they are potential targets for chemotherapy with Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Given the critical role of DNA methylation in gene expression and cell differentiation, it seems obvious that errors in methylation could give rise to various diseases, there are correlation between methylation abnormalities and diseases such as cancer, lupus, muscular dystrophy, and a range of birth defects that appear to be caused by defective imprinting mechanisms. Genetic studies have attempted to elucidate causal mechanisms for the development of complex disease, but genome-wide associations have been largely unsuccessful in establishing these links. As an alternative link between genes and disease, recent efforts have focused on mechanisms that alter the function of genes without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Known as epigenetic mechanisms, these include DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and, most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Although DNA methylation is involved in normal development, aging and gene regulation, altered methylation patterns have been associated with disease. It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to outline the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to genomic function, particularly in the development of complex behavioral phenotypes, focusing on the sensitive periods.</p></div>
