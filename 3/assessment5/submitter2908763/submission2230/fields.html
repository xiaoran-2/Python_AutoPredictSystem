    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alters gene expression. DNA methylation at CpG islands will cause the silencing or halt the transcribtion of the genes around the region. In cancer, there is there is aberrent methylation in the form of hypermethylation of the CpG islands.</p>
<p>  DNA hypermehtylation at the CpG islands can cause or contribute to cancer by transcribtional silencing of the genes around the CpG island that may contain sequences for tumour supressor genes that are suppose to halt the growth and multiplication of cancerous cells.</p>
<p>  Repetitive elements are long repeats of a single nucleotode, together with intergenic regions are supressed in normal cells by DNA methylation to prevent them from incerting into other regions of the genome and cause genomic instability.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is a general hypomethylation of these repetitive elements and the intergenic regions. this allows them to be transcribed and could therefore "jump" and incert into other areas of the genome, resulting in genomic instability which may be in form of transpositions, wrong recombinations, or disruption of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs have been developed that have the ability to target epigenetic procsses. Among these drugs is Decitabine, which is a DNA demethylating agent. this drug has the ability to remove methyl groups attached to the DNA in the genome.</p>
<p>In tumor cells, decitabine will remove the mehtyl groups on their DNA. This will mean that the hypermethylated CpG islands that have silenced the genes in the neighbouring area will be demethylated, and any gene that have been silenced as a result of the mehtylation will be transcribed, including the tumor supressor genes in the area, that will now be able to inhibit the growth and multiplication of the tumorous cells.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation and most epigenetic processes are mitoticaly heritable and therefore have lasting effects in the genome.</p>
<p>sensitive period is a period in development when epigenetic processes in the genome can be susceptible to environmental influence.</p>
<p>Two periods have been identified to be very sensitive in development; these periods are during premodial germ cell development and during the early blastocyst stage.</p>
<p>In these periods, the cells are in the form of stem cells, have the ability to transform into any of the cells of the body, and therefore their epigenome is susceptible to any chemical or physical challenge or alterations. and during these periods, any alteration done to the epigenome will be mitotically heritable.</p></div>
