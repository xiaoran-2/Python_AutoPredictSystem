    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, DNA methylation occurs via the addition of a methyl group to cytosine and adenine molecules (CG suppression); this occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context (at the 5' position of cytosine) to reduce gene expression in vertebrates. Normally, DNA methylation prevents a cell from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of cell. In addition, DNA methylation also serves the purpose of suppressing the expression of endogenous retroviral genes and other harmful stretches of DNA. In cancer cells, there are aberrant methylation patterns (such as hypermethylation and hypomethylation) present. These patterns can also introduce diseases other than cancer, as DNA methylation is also involved with X inactivation. Improper DNA methylation is also associated with genetic diseases such as Angelman syndrome, which results from genomic imprinting defects. Methylation functions in repetitive elements to silence transposable elements (transposons); when not contained, they act as mutagens. In cancer and other diseases, transposons insert themselves into functional genes and typically disable the gene; once they leave, resulting gaps are not repaired correctly. This can hinder precise chromosomal pairing during cell division and causes unequal crossovers. Transposable elements commonly cause diseases such as hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, works to treat myelodyplastic syndromes by DNA-demethylation. These work as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors; Decitabine works to treat cancer by suppressing stretches of oncogenes. Such epigenetic drugs also work to repress genes throughout mitosis and meiosis (unless they are actively erased) to enable long-term tumour suppression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In genomic imprinting, imprinted alleles are silenced such that certain genes are expressed only from maternal or paternal alleles; in Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), the paternal allele is not imprinted and is thus expressed. The maternal Igf2 allele undergoes DNA methylation and histone imprinting to ensure monoallelic gene expression. This results in Igf2 expression from only the paternal allele. Wilm's tumour, a type of kidney cancer that occurs typically in children, occurs from the combination of Igf2 overexpression and H19 hypermethylation. H19 DNA is biallelically hypermethylated, signifying that the H19 gene is genetically and epigenetically inactivated in Wilm's tumours. Abnormal levels of gene expression at these two clusters causes the additional encoding of putative 168 and 199 amino acid peptides.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As stated by Dr. Baylin, "<span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased." Ergo, generations of cells remain under the influence of these epigenetic controls regardless of continued administeration of medicine; a patient's cells will continue to exhibit altered epigenomes. In sensitive periods, a person's epigenome is actively being reprogrammed; such treatment may disrupt the methylation of areas other than target cells as well. DNA methylation is typically removed during zygote formation and re-established through successive cell divisions during development. To prevent complications, patients (particularly mothers carrying children) should not undergo epigenetic therapy during such sensitive periods to prevent abnormal gene expression in the developing child. Since the epigenome is "wiped clean" to restore pluripotency, drugs such as Decitabine would inhibit that effect and lead the zygote to fail to develop different cell types efficiently.</span></p></div>
