    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are commonly unmethylated since DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to the silencing of gene expression of the genes on that particular region.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands undergoes hypermethylation (more methylation than normal). The hypermethylation at the CpG islands causes the silencing of genes on that vicinity which might include the tumour-suppressor genes. Without the regulation of cell growth carried out by tumour-suppressor genes, cells will experience uncontrolled growth, leading to the development of tumour and cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. This helps to maintain genomic integrity through various ways: silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition, preventing illegitimate recombination and avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is a genome-wide lack of methylation at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. As a result, genomic instability might occur in the form of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition or activation of cryptic promoters. The disruption caused might affect proto-oncogene and/or tumour suppressor genes nearby. For instance, genomic instability can cause the translocation of strong promoter upstream of a proto-oncogene, leading to overexpression of oncogene and over-proliferation of cells. Alternatively, part of the tumour-suppressor gene could be deleted/interrupted due to the genomic instability, leading to the inactivation of tumour-suppressor gene and uncontrolled growth of cells. All in all, these cause the development of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as DNA methyltransferases inhibitor (DNMTi) drug.</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analogue and gets incorporated into DNA upon replication. As DNMT binds to DNA to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT so that DNMT cannot be released. This prevents DNMT from maintaining and carrying out methylation; or in other words, Decitabine has a DNA demethylation effect.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Decitabine is replication-dependent and therefore, cancer cells are more susceptible to the effect of Decitabine since they replicate much faster. With the reduction in methylation activity of DNMT, the hypermethylation of the CpG island regions can be mitigated and this also reduces the silencing of the genes on those particular regions. Consequently, this reduces the chances of tumour-suppressor genes being methylated and silenced. The activation of tumour-suppressor genes will lead to an anti-tumour effect due to the regulation of cell growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) of H19/Igf2 cluster is imprinted and methylated. The methylation prevents the binding of insulator protein, CTCF, at the ICR. Together with the methylation at H19 promoter, it enables downstream enhancers to access Igf2. Hence, paternal Igf2 is expressed, whereas paternal H19 is not expressed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the maternal ICR is not methylated, allowing CTCF and its cofactors to bind. The binding of CTCF to ICR insulates Igf2 from the action of downstream enhancers, which will then access H19 promoter instead. Hence, maternal Igf2 is not expressed, while maternal H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele at the H19/Igf2 cluster behaves like a paternal allele (expressing Igf2). This might be caused by various reasons: mutation or deletion that causes the loss of maternal imprinting and/or paternal uniparental disomy. As a result, there are now 2 copies of allele that expresses Igf2, leading to over-expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Since Igf2 is an oncogene, the over-expression of Igf2 leads to an over-production of growth promoting factors. Consequently, tumours/cancers might develop due to the uncontrolled proliferation of cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of epigenetic marks (DNA Methylation in this case) caused by the drugs are mitotically heritable, meaning that an epigenetically altered cell will pass down the epigenetic marks to all the daughter cells, which will then be passed down again to the subsequent generations of cells (assuming no mutation on epigenetic marks occuring). Without epigenetic reprogramming, the epigenetic treatment using the drugs will persist due to somatic maintenance.</p>
<p>Sensitive period refers to the period of development when the epigenome is the most susceptible to environmental signals/insults. During the sensitive periods, extensive epigenetic reprogramming is occuring.</p>
<p>Some of the sensitive periods of development are: the early development (pre-implantation embryo) and the primordial germ cell (PGC) development.</p>
<p>Drug treatment on patients during sensitive period, for example, by administering epigenetic drugs to a pregnant mother, may interfere and disrupt the process of epigenetic reprogramming. Since the pregnant mother carries a developing fetus, whose primordial germ cell is still developing, the drug will not just epigenetically affect the mother, but also the fetus and the primordial germ cell (potential 3rd generation) as well. This may cause unpredicted and unwanted future consequences that is lasting for more than one generation.  </p></div>
