    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are commonly found in promoter regions of genes and so they’re usually hypomethylated, to allow gene expression. However, mistakes can happen in CpG methylation in these promoters and sometimes that can lead to hypermethylation. This results in silencing the gene of that promoter, because hypermethylation in those areas ends up preventing the access of the transcription machinery to it. That can contribute to the formation of many diseases.  For instance, in cancer, tumor suppression genes are often silenced this way and so the cell becomes unable to stop frenzy cell division, if that ever happens. Therefore, one of the steps required for tumor formation is completed.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, in order to prevent their transcription, which is important in genomic stability. But, sometimes these regions are hypomethylated and that contributes to genomic instability, which is characteristic of cancer. Genomic instability is influenced by hypomethylation of these regions in basically three ways:</p>
<p>Firstly, these regions, which would be “protected” by heterochromatin and safe from structural changes, are now susceptible to such changes, as now they’re more exposed.</p>
<p>Secondly, since they’re more exposed, they can be transcribed. This cryptic transcription can result in bad products to the cell (For example, oncogenes that normally wouldn't be expressed could be in this situation.) and can disrupt the transcription of "normal" genes, like tumor suppressors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Thirdly, since repetitive elements and transposons can now be transcribed, they can invade other regions of the genome and bring forth more structural changes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This cluster is paternally imprinted, which means the ICR region is imprinted in the paternal allele, whereas it isn't in the maternal one. Normally, the methylation associated with the paternal allele  silences the ICR center, which acts as an insulator of the Igf2 enhancers. Therefore, the enhancers can act directly on Igf2 and so it is expressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR isn't imprinted and so, alongside the CTCF protein, it acts as the insulator mentioned before. Therefore , the enhancers can't act on Igf2, they act on the H19 region instead (which is also methyllated in the paternal allele). So, igf2 isn't expressed in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Problem is when this imprinting is disrupted. If the maternal allele, by some mistake in the methyllation machinery, becomes imprinted too, then it starts to behave just like a paternal allele. This leads to Igf2 expression in both alleles. As Igf2 is a cell growth promoter, the cell receives more information that it must grow than usual and that contributes to cancer, in this case Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor(DNMTi) drug. It acts as a nucleoside analog, which binds irreversibly to this enzyme and so renders it useless. Thing is, it only does that after the DNMT has binded to the DNA. That implies it's most useful on cells that divide a lot, such as cancer cells. Since it inhibits DNMTs, it's meant to decrease DNA methylation on CpG islands, in other words, to treat DNA hypermethylation in those areas. DNA hypermethylation is responsible for much of the gene silencing found in cancer cells, such as the silencing of tumor suppressors. Since DNMTi drugs, such as Decitabine, prevent such hypermethylation, then genes like tumor suppressors aren't silenced and so they can "fight" cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally speaking, epigenetic marks don't change their distribuition throughout one's life. During most of one's life, they only change because of eventual mistakes in perpetuating pre-existing marks. In the case of DNA methylation, it's stablished in early embryonic development and then perpetuated through one's life, except in the germ cell development, where it's remodelled.</p>
<p>These two periods (early embryonic development and germ cell formation) are known as sensitive periods. These are periods when the epigenetic landscape changes the most, new epigenetic marks are being put and old ones removed. That is the time when the epigenome is most susceptible to change from the envirionment. So, the use of drugs that change the epigenome would change the epigenome dramatically and that can have serious consequences. In the case of early embryonic development, the embryo may end up with genes that shouldn't be active and vice-versa which can lead to syndromes or even the death of the embryo. That's why preagnant women shouldn't take such drugs. In the case of germ cell development, the same effect can be observed, which can lead to fertility issues, for instance.</p></div>
