    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the basis for every different epigenetic case we’ve seen, such as imprinting, X inactivation, etc. This methylation phenomenon is generally related to gene expression. We know we can find CpG islands in the promoter region of many genes, like tumor suppressor genes. In a “normal” sate of the genome, CpG islands are usually free of methylation independent of the gene activity state.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation profiles can cause genomic instability, deregulation of imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes which control cell apoptosis or DNA repair. Hypermethylation at CpG islands can cause the same effect as a mutation.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, we find hypermethylation of these islands. Promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated causing gene silencing. Locus specific DNA hypermethylation can serve as biomarker to differentiate cancer cells from healthy cells and to verify tumor occurrence. During tumor progression, tumors apparently accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation. CpG island methylation can be useful for disease diagnosis and maybe treatment.</p>
<p>The genome is mostly conformed by intergenic and/or repetitive regions. When it is in an epigenetically normal state, genes can be found in heterochromatin and methylation is normal. These regions tend to undergo hypomethylation and cause genomic instability, which leads to a particular cancer type.</p>
<p>If there’s hypomethylation, promoters can jump or activate promoters causing aberrant transcription. DNA methylation promotes tumorigenesis as it can cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions can cause illegitimate recombination which leads to translocations and repeats can misalign.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICR’s can cause loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2 expression is determined by methylation of its ICR. Usually the paternal allele has an ICR that presents methylation, in which case CTCF insulator isn’t able to bind. As there’s no insulator activity, enhancers act on Igf2 allowing its expression and therefore promoting growth as it is a growth factor.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, ICR in the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind causing enhancers to act upon H19 instead of Igf2. There’s no expression of Igf2 and therefore no growth promoting activity.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the second most common children cancer, there’s hypermethylation in paternal AND maternal alleles causing overexpression of Igf2 and promoting this kidney’s tumor growth.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting factor that can be observed in preneoplasic tumors. Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of the ICR can occur in early stages or even originate tumors, causing the disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a group of DNA-demethylating agents. It is considered an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug. Every drug considered a demethylating agent is usually used for myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of AML (myelogenous leukemia).</p>
<p>This drug consists on a nucleoside analog which can incorporate to DNA upon replication. When DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) gets to bind to these nucleotides, it isn’t able to separate and keep methylating other genome regions. This is why we consider Decitabine a DNMT inhibitor as it interferes with DNA methylation restoring normal function of tumor suppressor genes. It works on cancer cells as they are on constant replication, allowing its incorporation to DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine is also consideres an antimetabolite agent. It can work as antineoplasic drug when used in lower doses. When cancer cells incorporate antimetabolite drugs, they act in its metabolism producing direct cytotoxic effects and therefore causing apoptosis of rapidly dividing cells. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are a lot of benefits on using drugs that alter epigenetic state of cells to treat cancer. Drugs targeting specific mutated forms that don’t affect neighboring cells and drugs that can be useful for other diseases other than cancer.</p>
<p>However, there are some stages in development where the use of these drugs can have adverse effects like altering epigenetic reprogramming natural course and provoking transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods of epigenetic reprogramming where cells undergo the removing of specific epigenetic marks, like DNA methylation. Early development and primordial germ cell development are the sensitive periods where paternal and maternal genome experience epigenetic reprogramming and have little or no DNA methylation.</p>
<p>If during these sensitive periods an epigenetic altering drug is administered, such as demethylating agents, genome epigenetic marks can be permanently altered causing gene silencing and probably increasing the risk of tumor appearance. There’s also a high risk of altering imprinted genes and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance can increase the patient’s offspring risk of disease. <strong></strong></p></div>
