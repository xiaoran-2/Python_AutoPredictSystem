    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at the promoter CpG islands silences gene transcription. DNA methyl binding protein MecP1&amp;2, bind to the methylated regions, which further recruits other epigenetic modifiers, such as HDACs and HMTs, to lay down multiple inactive markers and form the condense chromatin structure. MecP1&amp;2 probably inhibit transcriptional factor binding, which is the second mechanism for silencing gene expression. In normal cells, DNA is hypermethylated in the intergenic and repetitive regions and hypomethylated in CpG islands. In cancer, DNA methylation patterns were altered. Hypermethylation occurs at promoter CpG islands to inactivate the tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells. The hypermethylation also results in loss of imprinting, which overexpressing the growth promoting genes and reduceing the growth resitrict gene expression. The function of DNA methylation in intergenic and repetitive regions is to maintain the genome integrity and silence the cryptic transcriptional start sites or cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation at repeats maintains the genome integrity by a couple of mechanisms. First, methylation silences mobility of repetitive elements. Second, it mutates repeats to prevent transposition. It also silences repeats by avoiding the transcriptional interference from the strong promoter in transposable elements. Finally, methylation also avoids the illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, DNA becomes hypomethylated in the integenic and repetitive regions, which results in genomic instability. Loss of DNA methylation in these regions leads to the high frequencies of insertion, deletion and translocation in cancer cells, which may also interrupt the normal functions of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, and the methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence H19 expression. The methylation in ICR also blocks the CTCF insulator binding, allowing the enhancer to interact with <em>igf2</em> and activate<em> igf2</em> expression. In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF binding to prevent the enhancer to access to <em>igf2</em> and activate <em>igf2</em> expression. In Willm’s tumour, the loss of <em>igf2</em> imprinting is due to the methylation at ICR at the maternal allele, which blocks the CTCF binding, inactivating H19 and turning on igf2 expression by enhancer access. Methylation makes the maternal allele behave like paternal allele, which igf2 is express from both paternal and maternal alleles, and H19 is silenced. The overexpression of igf2 and inactivation of H19 results in uncontrolled cell growth, leading to tumor formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue, and irreversibly binds DNMTs after incorporating into DNA. During DNA replication, decitabines incorporate into the newly synthesized daughter strands, and DNMTs bind to the daughter strands but cannot release from them. With more cell division and DNA replication, the amount of free DNMTs reduces, and newly synthesized genome has lower methylation levels than the template. Therefore decitabine decreases methylation levels in the replication dependent manner. One characteristic of the cancer cells is hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes. With the proper dosage of decitabine, the amount of DNMTs decreases in the cancer cells, and may not have big influences on normal cells since cancer cells divide much faster than normal cells. Without sufficient DNMTs in cancer cells, some previously methylated tumor suppressor genes would be turned on by declined methylation levels, which elicit anti-tumor function.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have long-lasting effects because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable, which means the altered DNA methylation can be copied into the newly synthesized DNA strands in the divided cells during cell division without drug treatment. The epigenetic drugs can be used to treat adult and senior patients, but not in children or adolescences before puberty and pregnant women. There are two sensitive periods during the development, the permodial germ cell development and early embryonic development (preimplanation stage), in which the epigenetic markers are removed and then restored in the next generation, called epigenetic reprogramming. The epigenome is vulnerable to environmental stimuli during these periods since the epigenetic reprogramming process might be disrupted by stimuli. Epigenetic drugs are inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers. Therefore, young patients whose germ cells undergo development, and pregnant women whose babies are in early development, should not be treated with these drugs which might interrupt the epigenetic reprogramming and have terrible effects on the next generation through altering the epigenome. </p></div>
