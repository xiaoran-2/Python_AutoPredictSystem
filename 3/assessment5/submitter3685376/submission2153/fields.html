    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to gene silencing by leading to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, and/or by interfering with transcription factor binding. It is an important part of X chromosome inactivation. In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated and this causes silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells, so that they are silenced and don't cause genomic instability. In cancer however, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomehylated and are therefore active, leading to genomic instability through deletions, translocations, insertions, cryptic promoters, etc. Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, as it disrupts the normal functioning of the cell and can lead to inactivation of tumour suppressors and/or activation of oncogenes, leading to the uncontrolled proliferation of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to the DNA methylation normally found at Imprint Control Regions, either hypo or hyper methylation, can lead to loss of imprinting (by either expression both alleles, or expressing neither) and this can result in silencing of growth restricting genes or in overexpression of growth promoting genes, both of which aid cancer development.</p>
<p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, a normal cell will only express the paternal allele as its ICR will be methylated and thus not bound by CTCF, which being absent cannot block the activity of enhancers acting on Igf2, which is then expressed. The maternal allele will have an unmethylated ICR, which as a result can and is bound by CTCF, which in turn blocks the passage of enhancers that are then unable to act on Igf2 and instead act on H19. Therefore, the maternal allele in a normal cell does not express Igf2, but does express H19.</p>
<p>In a diseased cell, both the maternal and the paternal allele have a methylated ICR, and therefore both express Igf2. Igf2 is then overexpressed, and as it is a growth promoting gene, it can lead to the development of cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi), and a such it leads to DNA demethylation. It acts by irreversibly binding DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, thereby inhibiting them from laying down methyl groups in hemimethylated DNA strands. This results in a decline in DNA methylation as a result of cell division. It has an anti-tumour effect because it counteracts the hypermethylation found in/near tumour suppressor genes (which cause them to be silenced). By fighting the hypermethylation, Decitabine leads to re-activation of tumour suppressor genes, which would have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment through the interplay of genetics and epigenetics. Changes to methylation can lead to genomic changes through variations in the level of genomic instability (through intergenic regions and repetitive elements in the case of methylation), as wells as through changes to the level of aberrant DNA repair in heterochromatin. These effects are enduring because of their genomic nature.</p>
<p>Additionally, during sensitive periods like primordial germ cell (PGC) development and early development -- when most of the epigenetic reprogramming is taking place-- it is important to avoid treating patients with epigenetic drugs. These drugs are in general not targeted, meaning they affect epigenetic marks in all cells including normal ones, and can have a deleterious effect on the latter. Particularly during these periods of intense epigenetic reprogramming, tinkering with epigenetic marks can have far-reaching repercussions for the patients.</p></div>
