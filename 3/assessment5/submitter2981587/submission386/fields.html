    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA and this occurs at cytosines. The methyl group is added onto the carbon group to make H3C at the 5-methyl cytosine. CpG’s are clustered into CpG islands. Methylation at CpG islands equals silencing of gene expression. TheCpG islands are more likely to be methylated in cancer cells. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.</p>
<p>In cancer there is a genome wide lack of methylation, with hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and repeats and therefore genomic instability. DNA methylation is laid down by de nova methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) in mammals.</p>
<p>Genome instability and mutation leads to tumour promoting inflammation and therefore disease states.</p>
<p>Methylation at CpG islands leads to a tumour invasion and disease. Disease cells, such as cancer cells, stimulate their own growth and they also resist cell death (apoptosis).With CpG island methylation playing an important part in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development, this situation is frequently altered in disease situations, such as cancer.</p>
<p>The majority of CpG islands are normally unmethylated, however a sizeable proportion can become methylated in pathological situations. Sequencing, DNA repeats and DNA structure are correlated with CpG island methylation. DNA composition of CpG islands (sequencing, repeats and structure) plays a very important role in the predisposition of CpG islands for DNA methylation and in the development of disease.</p>
<p>As DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modifier in the control of gene expression these patterns are particularly important. These methylation patterns are modified in cancer cells and are therefore distinguishable  from normal cell tissue. DNA methylation  directly interferes with the binding of transpositional factors that are sensitive to methylated CpG islands. Alteration of DNA methylation patterns is the hallmark of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypomethylation leads to oncogene activation, hypermethylation and tumour suppressor gene silencing, which acts with methyl changes to modify gene expression, which results in disrupted genome imprinting contributing to a high risk of colorectal cancer and leads to Wilms tumour.</p>
<p>Methylation marks upstream of the region of the H19 gene , is not only methylated in parent of origin specific way, but also regulates the silencing of the maternal Lgf2 and paternal H19 alleles respectively. This means that the paternal allele becomes partially  demethylated, where as the maternal allele gains methylation.</p>
<p>This leads to activation of the silent maternal Lgf2 allele, which leads to Wilms tumour, which arises from increased expression of the Lgf2 gene responsible for a predisposition to tumours.</p>
<p>The H19 gene being hypomethylated on the expressed maternal allele and hypermrthylated on the silent paternal allele. Also since hypermethylation is inherited from sperm and retained on the paternal allele throughout development.</p>
<p>In the case of the paternal allele, the methylation pattern found in sperm undergoes further modification during embryogenesis.</p>
<p>The imprinted locus encompassing the oppositely imprinted H19 and Lgf2 genes. The methylated domain of the H19 gene, blocks access of the Lgf2 gene to shared enhancers on the maternal allele and inactivates H19 expression on the methylated paternal allele.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer medication that interfers with the growth and spread of cancer cells.</p>
<p>It is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic  syndrome.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and it has shown substiantial potency in reactiviating epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Genes can become transcriptionally silenced during tumour development, which is associated with aberrant DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Aberrant hypermethylation of the CGI’s is associated with the transcriptional silencing of genes, which plays a significant role in tumourigenesis. Reversal of gene methylation and epigenetic silencing can influence tomour growth and sensitivity to anti cancer agents.</p>
<p>This demethylation therapy has the ability of causing DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to revert hypermethylation induced gene silencing: This results in hypermethylation induced gene silencing of tomour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The reversion of these epigenetic mutations can restore control and apoptosis sensitivity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene function may be altered by either a change in the sequence of the DNA or a change in epigenetic  programming of a gene in the absence of a sequence change. With epigenetic drugs it is possible to reverse aberrant gene expression, associated with different diseases.</p>
<p>The drugs that alter DNA methylation and hence effect and reverse epigenetic programming will therefore last beyond the drug treatment therapy. DNA methylation is essential for cell differentiation  and embryonic development.</p>
<p>Research has determined that mice that lack a particular DNMT have reduced methylation levels and die early in development ( Suzuki &amp; bird 2008). So the altering of DNA methylation does have a definite effect on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA is long term and reasonably stable, however in some cases in germ cells, when silencing of imprinted genes must be reversed, demethylation can take place to allow for epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>The epigenetic mechanism that assist with the regulation of gene activity in the CNS are recognized for their role in cellular differentiation, genome imprinting and some diseases. However the epigenome remains sensitive to environmental influences particularly in developmental and behavioural neuroscience. Early life experiences interact with genes in these sensitive periods in the developing brain.</p></div>
