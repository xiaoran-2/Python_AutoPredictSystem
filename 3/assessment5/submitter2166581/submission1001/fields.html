    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (usually gene promotors) are mainly unmethylated - unless on inactive X chromosome - in normal cells, but are hypermethylated in cancer cells which turn off tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, therefore contributed to tumorgenesis. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells to silent the repeats, but are hypomethylated genome-wide which lead to genomic instability, i.e. activation of repeats and transposition which lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, and activation of cryptic promoters therefore disruption of neighboring genes (all of these can lead to disease).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 and express paternal allele, on the other hand ICR is unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind to ICR. CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Therefore the maternal allele of igf2 is not expressed (instead H19 is expressed). In Wilm’s tumor ICR is hypermethylated which leads to overexpression of Igf2 (maternal allele is also expressed), a growth promoting gene, which lead to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It acts as nucleoside analogues which bind to DNMTs and reduce the DNA methylation. The goal is to reverse hypermethylation on tumor suppressor genes and therefore control tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable altering can have enduring effects. Pre-implantation early embryonic development and primodial germ cell development are two sensitive periods when genome-wide epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Because epigenetic machineries are used for all cell types, and in normal cells as well as tumor cells, the inhibition is not specific and therefore inadvisable especially during sensitive reprogram periods.</p></div>
