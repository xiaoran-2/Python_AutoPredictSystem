    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands varies with context. It's generally thought to cause the silencing of the downstream gene expressions. There's unusually hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands in the cancer cells e.g in colorectal cancer.The hypermethylation of CpG islands lead to genomic instability, deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation in intergenic regions may have a role in genomic instability and to silence cryptic transcription start sites or cyptic splice sites.  DNA methylation in repetitive elements are important for the genomic stability by silencing the repeats from transposition and avoid interference from strong promoters. There is DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. The DNA hypomethylation causes the activation of transposons and oncogenes that subsequently drives carcinogenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There is DNA methylation at the ICR that blocks the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein and also the H19 promoter on the paternal allele allow the enhancers to bind to the Igf promoter and activates the gene. On the maternal allele, there is no DNA methylation at the ICR which allows the access of CTCF to bind to it, isolating Igf2 from downstream enhancers and allows the transcription of H19 gene. Loss of DNA imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to the aberrant expression of Igf2 gene which is normally imprinted and contibutes to cancer. Increased Igf2 expression upregulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway and subsequently drives the tumorigenesis of Wilm's tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA demethyltransferase inhibitor. It irreversibly binds to DNA demethyltransferases (DNMTs) after being incorporated into the DNA and inhibits DNMTs' function. There is generally DNA hypermethylation found in the promoter CpG islands, hence by inhibiting DNMTs, decitabine can prevent the hypermethylation process that plays a role in driving the tumorigenesis in certain cancers. This has been proven to be useful in myelodysplastic syndrome that progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are passed on from generation to generation during mitosis until they are actively erased. Thus, by altering the DNA methylation e.g. by drugs can lead to the complete removal of the methylation marks after a couple of cell divisions. And once the methylation mark is erased, there's no point of return. This is why drug altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the cells beyond the treatment period. Sensitive periods are the timing when altered environment can have an effect on the epigenetic remodeling. The sensitive periods of developments are the period from primordial germ cell development till the production of mature gamates, pre-implantation and early post-implantation periods. if treating patients during these sensitive periods, the drugs will alter the epigenetic reprogramming which is important for the development of the organisms during the embryonic phase as well as the production of viable gamates. </p></div>
