    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Some "house-keeping" genes have CpG islands in promotor. These genes are expressed in different tissues, and methylation helps them to be expressed in each tissue in a right way. For example, there is difference between metylation in kidney and eye.<br />2. Methylated CpG  are "hot points" for mutations. CpG hypomethylation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation are important parts of beginnig of cancer. </p>
<p>3. Hypomethylation in gene suppressor's promotor can make its expression lower and contribute to cancer.<br />4.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, because they don't have special function and there is no sense "to work" for them. There are ither genes with the same function. And it is important to make them silent. And methylation do this.<br />5. In cancer they are not methylated, so they begin express and make their protein products. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. <span>Methylation and demethylation related to control of gene expression. </span><span>Methylation of promotor site of the gene, or close to it plot inhibits transcription. DNA demethylation restores the expression of a gene. Decitabine activation of the gene can be expressed in the induction of differentiation, a desirable effect in therapy different cancer syndromes and other malignant tumors of blood, activation of genes tumor suppression and other genes whose effects extend to many types of tumors. Complexes of the enzyme DNA-methyltransferase and 5-Aza-deoxycitidin may cause apoptosis, when the cell is stuck in a loop of DNA synthesis and induced cell cycle insulation and mitotic lock. The result of the Decitabine effects can be overcome drug resistance, relief immune responses, the induction of apoptosis. Decitabine operates in the S phase of the cell cycle. The cells themselves have to walk to the S-phase, to the Decitabine effect manifested as possible.</span></p></div>
