    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation  in cancer can occur as two types. They can be either locus specific DNA hypermethylation as seen at CpG islands or Genome- wide DNA hypomethylation as seen at repetitive regions. First let us consider methylation at CpG islands: CpG islands are usually located at promotor regions of tumor suppressor gene. In normal cells, CpG islands are protected from methylation and promote expression of these tumor suppressor gene. In Cancer cells, CpG islands are methylated which results in condensation and silencing of these genes. This is considered one of the multiple hits resulting in cancer as per Knudson hypothesis. This is also one of the most frequently seen abnormality in tumors as they are mitotically heritable. CGI methylation is also known to increase with tumor progression. Eg: single gene - RB in retinoblastoma and BRCA1 in breast cancer; CIMP - set of genes hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Next let us consider, genome-wide DNA hypomethlation that occurs at repetitive and intergenic regions. In normal cells, these regions are methylated to maintain genomic instability. It prevents transcription interference and illegitimate recombination between repeats. In cancer cells, there is hypomethylation at repeats and CpG poor promoters. Of these two regions, repeats are more important. Hypomethylation at repeats in cancer cells causes genomic instability which causes illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. The genomic instability can further promote development of cancer. Hypo methylation at CpG poor promoters causes activation of oncogenes thus can result in tumors</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR) control expression of genes in parent specific manner.  Methylation of this region can cause tumors. An example for this is H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells, this cluster is methylated in paternal allele but not in maternal allele, so it is imprinted on paternal allele. Upstream of this ICR is Igf2 which is a strong growth promotor and downstream is H19 which has role as a long coding RNA and strong enhancers. When this ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele, it binds an insulator protein called CTCF. This insulates binding of enhancers to Igf2 due to this the enhancers are free to act on H19. In paternal allele there is methylation at ICR so the insulator protein does not bind and the enhancers are free to act on Igf2. Thus the expression of Igf2 occurs from paternal allele. Also, the methylation spreads to H19 which results in silencing of the gene. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele functions as paternal allele resulting in methylation at ICR resulting in increased expression of Igf2 gene. Igf2 is a growth promotor which results in increased growth and thus can cause tumors</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs such as decitabane target enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Decitabine acts as DNA methylation transferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and used for Myelodysplastic syndrome which progresses to AML. DNMT transfers methyl groups to daughter strands when there is cell division. For DNMTi to be effective the cells should be active and dividing as happens in MDS. Decitabine among other actions prevents DNMT from transfering methyl groups. This is important for MDS as - it has hypermethylated CpG islands probably in regions of oncosuppressor genes. Decitabine by removing methyl group may help in expression of these genes and thus promoting anti-tumor effects</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period is the time when there is heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. There are two such periods when there is a reprogramming of the epigenetic marks happens in the germ cells. The first happens during primoridial germ cells and the second is during pre and post implantation time. This is the time during which DNA methylation are reset and it can be inherited transgenerationally. DNA methylation that happen during other phases are also mitotically heritable. Thus, changing epigenetic marks with drug treatment can cause long enduring effects which can last beyond period of drug treatment.</p></div>
