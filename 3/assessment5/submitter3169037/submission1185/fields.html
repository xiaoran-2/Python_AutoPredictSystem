    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions which contain a concentration of  PhosphoDiester bond linked, Cytosine and Guanine.  CpG islands are usually unmethylated. Methylation of CpG Islands that act as promoters cause gene silencing, and heterochromatin formation, parental imprinting. In cancer the CpG islands are hypermethylated and this could include island shores. Such hypermethylation causes disease by acting to silence tumor suppressors leading to uncontrolled division. Activation of oncogenes occur also due to hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters. Methylation of intergenic regions prevent instability and maintain genomic integrity. Intergenic and repetitive elements are typically methylated. In cancer they are found typically hypomethylated, happens early with sustained increase with time.  Such hypomethylation leads to instability driven insults as a result of ensuing illegitimate recombination - repeats duplicating itself and transposition, leading to disruption of self or neighboring gene. This leads to instabilities ranging from deletions through reciprocal translocations to additions. This heterogeneity of methylation as causal factors for Cancer makes the addressing of this problem more difficult and would need finer grained characterisation to identify the selectivity specific factors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 ncRNA occurs along with Igf2 protein coding gene which exhibits paternal expression.  In the case of insulator (CTCF)mediated imprinting,  H19 is maternally expressed and Igf2, paternally expressed. Overexpression is the cause for disease. Maternal Imprint Control Region(ICR) is unmethylated, thereby allowing CTCF (and its cofactors, cohesin and p68/SRA)insulator binding. This binding allows downstream enhancers to access H19 promoter. Paternal ICR is methylated, causing  blocking of insulator binding. The H19 promoter is also methylated. The enhancers in the paternal allele therefore access the Igf2, leading to its paternal expression.</p>
<p>The loss of Imprinting in H19/Igf2 cluster is due to biallelic expression of Igf2 caused by HyperMethylation(CTCF binding sites) of the Maternal alleles H19 Proximal Imprint Center[Ref: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/4/4/283.full] This methylation specificity is heterogeneous to the cancer type and for example, paternal hypermethylation  is implicated in Bladder Cancer[Ref above]. Also a Differentially Methylated Region(DMR) located upstream of Igf2 is found to carry a maternal Methylation mark. Loss or HypoMethylation is also implicated in Wilms Tumor[Ref above]. Therefore site specific heterogeneity of the methylation effect extends down to within a cancer type further complicating analysis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can arise from Epigenetic effects. Unlike genetic (mutations), epigenetcs are reversible, mitotically heritable.  Therefore, epigentics can identify/treat cancer. Two of epigenetic modifications are Methylation of the DNA either directly or via 3D structure forming proteins that support those DNAs in chromosomes - Histone Methylation or Acetylation. Often, Methylation has been found to have a silencing effect.  When silencing is ascribed to Overactive Methylation of tumor supressors, it results in  cancer, as there is no stabilizing control, which would have been otherwise afforded by the tumor suppresors, over uncontrolled division of tumor cells. Decitabine works by demythylating DNA (DNA Methyl Transfer Inhibitor, DNMTi)so that tumor supressors are now active and can stabilize uncontrolled growth. These work by permanently binding the DNMT irreversibly.  Therefore its effectiveness is dependent on cell division cancer cells are therefore favorably selectively affected.  It is indicated for the treatment of Myelodysplastic syndrome, progressed to Acute Leukemia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can cause cancer and being reversible are leveraged to treat cancer.  Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, often transgenerationally heritable. A treatment for cancer based solely on chemotherapic drugs typically act by killing all the cancerous cells. Therefore, such treatment could be viewed as more symptomatic approach, as opposed to an Epigentic treatment, wherein due to the inheritability, the tumor nature of the uncontrollably dividing cells is now removed across the mitotic heritance chain.  Therefore, with a combination of Epigenetic treatment followed by Chemotherapy could result in a better and faster cure than a chemotherapic treatment alone, due to the persistence of tumor cancellation effect of the Epigenetic modification across this mitotic (and possibly transgenerational) inheritance chain, the Chemotherapy now having to deal only with the subset of  cancerous cells that escaped possibly the Epigenetic modifications making the problem more tractable.</p>
<p>Epigenetics affect all tissues inheritably,  and therefore the side effects could be across the board and passed on down. Sensitive periods, periods of development susceptible to environment signals  such as childhood, germ cell development phase, pre-implantation phase therefore run the risk of permanently have the effects, including side effects, of Epigenetic modification pass on down the heritance.</p></div>
