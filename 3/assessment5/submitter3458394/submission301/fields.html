    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found throughout the genome but often in greater concentrations in the promotors of genes. Normally these islands are unmethylated so that the gene can be expressed but if they are methylated, (as they are increasingly so in cancerous cells), the effect would be to silence the gene. This is often achieved by causing the chromatin to develop into a more repressive heterochromatin structure such as in the case of X inactivation.   In cancerous cells there is hypermethylation of some CpG islands and their island shores. Whilst this is generally true for all tumours so far studied, the precise genes targetted seem to be specific for each cancer.  They are usually the CpG islands associated with the promotors of tumour suppressing genes, eg those controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair so in cancerous cells these genes are silenced. As the cancer progressses so does the level of hypermethylation, often of a set of genes,  so this can be used as a diagnostic tool.</p>
<p> In non-cancerous cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated but are hypomethylated in cancerous cells. As the cancer progresses so do levels of hypomethylation.  In normal cells this methylation serves to promote genome stability by preventing the transposons within the intergenic regions from moving, and creating regions of hetrochromatin so disallowing illegitimate recombination sites which could lead to genome changes such as translocations, deletions and insertions - all of which occur in cancerous cells with these regions hypomethylated. The methylation also normally serves to silence cryptic transcription start sites, possibly inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing (week 6 reading) all of which would be disrupted in hypomethylated cancerous cells, leading to the activation of some genes eg growth promotors or the silencing of others, eg tumour supressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele shows methylation of the Imprint Control Region.  CTFC, an insulator protein,  therefore cannot bind to the ICR so the downstream enhancers cannot promote the transcription of H19 and instead loop to Igf2 and promote its expression. This methylation of the ICR spreads  to the promoter of the H19 region, further silencing it.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is NOT methylated, so neither is the promoter for the H19 gene,  the CTFC protein can bind to the ICR which insulates the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, so Igh2 is NOT expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, a childhood or early embryonic tumour of the kidney, imprinting is disrupted so that the maternal allele is methylated in the same way as the paternal allele, therefore an affected individual effectively has two alleles, both of which act in the same way as normal paternal alleles. Thus CTFC cannot bind to the ICR on either allele leading to over expression of Igf2 - a growth promoter. The Kcnq1 cluster ,is close to the H19 cluster on chromosome 11 and if it’s imprinting is disrupted as well there will also be a lack of expression of the maternal Cdknlc - a tumour suppressor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine acts as a DNA demethylating agent, belonging to the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into the DNA during DNA replication.  However, when DNMT1 comes to methylate the DNA after mitosis the decitabine binds to DNMT1 irreversibly, thereby preventing the methylation of the new strand of the DNA. Thus every time a cell divides the new cell does not have its DNA methylated so the level of methylation in the tumour’s cells overall falls.</p>
<p>Decitabine therefore only effects actively dividing cells, since cancer cells divide much more rapidly than non-cancerous ones this means that they are preferentially targeted. In cancer cells, particularly blood cancers such as myelodysplastic syndrome,  where decitabine is used, there is hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressing genes, the removal of this methylation could ensure these genes are not silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. Therefore if the DNA methylation pattern is altered in one tumour cell, during drug treatment, when that cell divides, the epigenetic marks it carries will be copied into the daughter cells and in all subsequent cells arising from the one altered cell even after treatment finishes.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are involved in the remodelling of epigenetic marks - the clearing of parental and the laying down of new DNA methylation marks. These sensitive periods occur during very early preimplantaion development of the foetus or during the development of primordial germ cells, for example this is when  much imprinting takes place. </p>
<p>These periods, eg in pregnant women, /are therefore particularly sensitive to changes in the environment when laying down epigenetic marks, for example, it has been shown in mice that dietary changes in the mother during these periods can alter the epigenetic marks in the offspring.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods is therefore inadvisable as there may be long lasting consequences for any offspring as their imprinting, X inactivation and the laying down of their and their offspring in the next generation may be affected.</p></div>
