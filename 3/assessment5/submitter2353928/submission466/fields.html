    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is usually involved in silencing certain regions of DNA. In cancer this methylation is usually altered and thus the cell doesn't function properly.</p>
<p>- For example, CpG islands are usually not heavily mehtylated on normal functing DNA if the gene is expressed.</p>
<p>- DNA methylation of CpG islands can cause the promoters to be silenced, meaning they can't do their normal function.</p>
<p>- If CpG islands are mehtylated, then they can't function properly. And since they are often involved in cell regulation, this can cause a series of interference with normal cell function, such as telling the cell when to stop replicating.</p>
<p>- Intergenic region and repetitive elements of normal functioning DNA have no known function and are often non-coding regions.</p>
<p>- Cance can disrupt intergenic regions by unmethylating them and making them active, causing the cells to code essentially non-sense DNA</p>
<p>-Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetiive elements can contribute to disease if they become active. This is because they will start coding for stuff that isn't needed by the cells which can disrupt normal cell functioning leading to many harmful effects.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can interfer with which parental allele is expressed and which one is silenced. If both alleles are expressed or silenced when only one specific paternal allele needs to be expressed it can lead to interference of cell regulation.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- The paternal allele of H19/lgf2 is usually heavily methylated while the maternal allele is usually hypomethylated. When the promoter of the H19 is methylated it causes<span> the H19/Igf2 cluter to be silenced. This would mean that the maternal copy is expressed, but not the paternal copy.</span></p>
<p><span>-  Imprinting can cause increased levels of H19/Igf2 expression and Wilm's tumor has been found to be associated with increased levels of expression of the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>-H19/Igf2 is linked to the <span>ploidy of cells and if this isn't properly regulated it can lead to certain forms of tumors and cancer such as Wilm's tumor</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylator. As cancer is sometimes caused by over methylation of certain gene clusters, unmethylating them can prevent new cancer cells from forming. </p>
<p>- Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demethylation agents.</p>
<p>- Decitabine demthylates certain parts of the DNA</p>
<p>- This has an anti-tumour effect by preventing new cells from forming as over methylation of DNA has been show to cause cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>- Seeing that DNA methylation is invovled in regulating DNA expression, using drugs that alter DNA methylation can have long lasting effects as they may alter the methylation pattern of genes that are not involved in the cancer and thus can disrupt cell function; especially over a long period. This happens because we still do not have the technology to alter methylation at specific regions of the DNA without effecting other areas of DNA.<br />- In the elderly this may not be as big of an issue as their cells are not replicating as often and therefore are less influenced by epigenetics and mehtylation. So treatment of this sort for them would work well. On the other hand this could have very bad side effects for younger people and especially those still developing as their cell may be going through a sensitive period (a period in time during which the fetus's cell are going through epigenetic reprograming. So the previous DNA methylations are cleared out and new ones are being made) as it could disrupt the formation of methylations thus altering cell function and impairing development.</p></div>
