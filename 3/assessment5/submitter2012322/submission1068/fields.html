    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation at CpGs islands is related to the silencing of gene expression, probably by recruiting proteins which in turn recruit protein complexes associated with chromatin remodeling (heterochromating formation that avoids the coupling of transcription machinery). In general, DNA methylation at CpGs islands tends to be diminished. In cancer cells, however, DNA methylation at CpG islands tends to be increased (hypermethylation). Such disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease by silencing tumor supressor genes which control cell cycle by avoiding cell division. On the other hand, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is increased since it plays an important role in silencing (by heterochromatin formation) transposable elements, repetitive elements, cryptic promoters, among other sequences.  In cancer cell genomes, DNA methylation in such regions tend to be decreased (hypomethylated). Hypomethylation at intergenic regions reduces chromatin packaging which in turn may activate transposable elements. The activation of such elements leads to increased mutation rates and to the inactivation of tumor supressor genes or the activation of oncogenes. Furthermore, this loss of packaging could lead to cryptic promoters activation. Such promoters control the transcription of non-coding RNAs that could affect the expression of genes relevant to the control of cell cycle. Finally, hypomethylation of repetitive elements could lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats which would lead to abnormal chromosome recombination. In fact, chromosomal aberrations are common in cancer.    </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which avoids CTCF (i.e., an insulator) to recognize its target sequence. As no insulation occurs, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter and silences it. Then, enhancers placed downstream to H19 promoter can access Igf2 to activate. Conversely, in the maternal allele the ICR region is unmethylated and the CTCF binds its target sequence, exerting its insulation function. In this case, the H19 promoter does not get methylated and, therefore, it remains active. Thus, enhancers do not access Igf2, remaining inactive. In Wilm's tumor both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated due to hypermetilation events ocurring in maternal chromosome. Thus, the maternal copy of H19 is also methylated and enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it. Then, such disruption of imprintong leads to two active copies of Igf2. Given that Igf2 is a growth factor that is able to induce cell growth and division, the double dosage generated by the two copies can induce cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent or a hypomethylating agent. The active inhibitor in the cell is its triphosphate form which incorporates into the DNA to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and, thus, to reduce DNA methylation levels. Then, Decitabine exerts its anti-tumour effect by reversing epigenetic silencing generated by aberrant DNA methylation of genes that supress tumorogenesis, that is to say, it reactivates tumor supressor genes previously inactivated by increased methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation tend to be a very stable mark: once adquired it is mantained across cell divisions, and only will be erased by active mechanisms. In addittion, some researchers believe that once are lost, methylation marks are never recovered. According to this view, alterations in DNA methylation profiles can have enduring effects on the epigenome that can last for a long time (even the entire lifetime). This effect could be stronger if DNA methilation occur in sensitive periods, i.e., a periods of time in which there are increased probabilities of being affected by a stimulus (in this case, DNA methylation). There are two sensitive periods of development: during epigenetic reprogramming following fertilization and during gamete maturation. However, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because treatment could disrupt normal epigenetic processes involved in development which in turn could induce developmental alterations leadind to death or disease (in the case of developmental treatment), or to heritable alterations that could affect the offspring development and/or health (in the case of treatment carried out in gametes).</p>
