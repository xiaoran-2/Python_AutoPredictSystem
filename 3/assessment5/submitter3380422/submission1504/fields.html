    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are hypomethylated for genes that must be expressed, signaling starting points for transcription. In cancer the CpG islands at promotor epigenes are errantly methylated when a gene must be expressed or errantly unmethylated when a gene must be repressed. By inactivating tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenes in combination, cancer cells reproduce at a rapid rate and gain immortality, two of the hallmarks of cancer.  Since methylation is highly heritable, once a tumor suppressor gene is silenced by hypermethylation, tumor suppression is locked into an inactive state. Daughter cells with silenced tumor suppressor genes become the more dominant cells and malignancies form. On the other hand, usually oncogenes are silenced in normal somatic tissues, but when expressed under conditions of promoter hypomethylation, cells will divide and grow out of control. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in normal cells, when DNA is methylated genome-wide, nearby associated genes are suppressed, which is very important in tissue differentiation, gene imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and control of endogenous retroviral insertions and repetitive elements.  Consequently, much of the human genome has hypermethylated CpG pairs.  Methylation has an effect on the chromatin structure, creating densely packed heterochromatin that is not easily transcribed where there are intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In cancer, however, epigenetic changes in methylation occur causing hypomethylation genome-wide and DNA instability.  When this happens in areas that contain repetitive elements, the repetitive sequence can be transcribed, amplifying the usually silent genes and creating an overabundance of a particular product.  Genetic sequences that are usually silenced in normal cells such as reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions become activated.  Multiple copies of oncogenes that control cell growth and longevity, for example, can begin to be expressed causing a flood of signals for uncontrolled growth and contributing to disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes slow fetal growth so that mothers can more easily carry and deliver smaller offsprings.  In gametes, paternal alleles of genes that cause growth are inactivated whereas maternal alleles that suppress growth are activated.</p>
<p>The H19/lgf2 cluster imprint control region on chromosome 11 works to block an epigenetic enhancer. In normal cells the maternal alleles are unmethylated while the paternal alleles are methylated.  The unmethylated maternal allele is bound by insulater protein CTCF.  Growth promoter Igf2 is insulated from the action of a downstream enhancer in the cluster.  The enhancer instead acts upon H19 creating a long non-coding RNA that is a reservoir for a micro-RNA.  The methylated paternal allele cannot be bound by CTCF so the downstream enhancers act on and promote the Igf2 oncogene.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor the maternal allele is errantly hypermethylated at the ICR and the H19 gene and it begins to act like the paternal allele.   Loss of imprinting occurs in pre-neoplastic tissue.  The insulator protein CTCF cannot bind, the downstream enhancers are then free to act upon igf2, and there is a double dose of the oncogene.  When an oncogene is overexpressed, unregulated growth begins and cancer ensues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cancer targeting drug classified as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is chemically similar to cytosine so it is incorporated into the DNA creating DpG dinucleotides.  It probably acts at promotors for tumor suppressor genes where it blocks DNMT1 during mitosis. The methyl group is blocked from being incorporated into the daughter cells and the promotors become hypomethylated which has a positive effect on neoplastic cells because it epigenetically restores the normal functioning of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, tumor suppressor genes are silenced by hypermethylation at epigenetic control regions creating heterochromatin.  If the action of methyltransferase is inhibited, the daughter cells can begin to become unmethylated so that the chromatin can open into euchromatin and the tumor suppressor gene and other cancer controlling genes can be expressed.  Over time, the tumor will stop growing as the unmethylated (and healthy) versions of the daughter cells begin to proliferate. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic methylation causes silenced genes and is genetically stable in somatic tissue. Upon mitosis, methylation is copied into daughter cells. Additionally, alteration of methylation during primordial germ cell development can have effects in subsequent generations.</p>
<p>There are periods when the epigenome is sensitive to changes in methylation.   If mutations or methylation alterations occur at these periods, the effects can be permanent as well as genome wide. Sensitive periods are during X-inactivation and imprinting, during early development of fertilized eggs when DNA methylation is being reprogrammed and during development of primordial germ cells.  The latter periods are different for males and females because the primordial germ cells mature into eggs and sperm at different ages. Sensitive periods thus occur just before fertilization and during early embryo development and while we are youngsters. </p>
<p>Treatment with epigenetic-altering drugs during sensitive periods may alter epigenetic markers genome wide. We may use a drug, for example, to effect the methylation at CpG islands of a tumor suppressor and end up changing the methylation genome-wide. Oncogenes which are normally silenced by hypermethylation could become activated. We may control cancer of the patient but create cancer in future generations of offspring from the patient. </p></div>
