    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions with higher content of CpG dinucleotides than the rest of the genome. In mammalian genomes, CpG islands are encountered in the promoters of approximately 60% of the genes. In normal, non-cancerous cells, CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer cells, the opposite happens, CpG islands are progressively hypermethylated as the cancer progresses with time. Methylation of these islands in promoters correlates with gene silencing. The hypermethylation at CpG sites in promoters of tumor suppressor genes is one step towards uncontrolled cell proliferation. Tumor suppressor genes are involved in the cell cycle as their role is to constrain cell division. When such genes are silenced by hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters, they can no longer carry out their normal function, and this results in excessive cell division.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells which significantly contributes to genomic stability. Methylation of these regions prevents from ectopic recombination and reciprocal translocations between non-homologous chromosomes. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated which can result in chromosomal aberrations like deletions, insertions and translocations, i.e. genomic instability. Hypomethylated repetitive elements which in normal cells are inactive could reactivate themselves and transpose from one place in the genome to another. This process could disrupt the normal function of genes if they become affected. If the affected genes are tumor suppressors, this could lead to uncontrolled cell division. A third mechanism of contribution of hypomethylation at repetitive elements to oncogenesis is through activation of the promoters of these elements. This could lead to transcriptional aberrations of neighbouring genes. If these genes are oncogenes, i.e. genes promoting cell growth and division, the upregulation of their expression can result in uncontrolled cell proliferation.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene which codes for a major embryonic growth factor and the H19 gene located downstream of it whose product is a long non-coding RNA. Between these genes lies an imprinting control region (ICR). On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated which allows an insulator protein called CTCF to bind to it. The binding of CTCF prevents distal enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene and thus Igf2 transcription from this allele is inhibited. Instead, the enhancers stimulate expression of H19. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF from binding and allows distal enhancers to promote expression of Igf2. Methylation at ICR spreads to the promoter of H19 silencing this gene. So, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele but not from the maternal one. In patients with Wilm’s tumor, e. g. patients with Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, the ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated which causes the Igf2 gene on this allele to behave like the one on the paternal allele, i.e. to be expressed too. This leads to overexpression of Igf2 which results in excessive cell growth and division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors  are nucleoside analogues, meaning that their structure is similar to that of nucleosides. Therefore they are incorporated by DNA polymerase into the daughther strands of DNA in the process of DNA replication. Hence the action of these drugs is replication dependent. Once incorporated into DNA, Decitabine irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases which inhibits their normal function to methylate DNA. The result is less methylated DNA.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated which leads to their silencing and uncontrolled cell division. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, Decitabine helps to reduce methylation of tumor suppressor genes allowing them to regain proper function and control cell proliferation again.</p>
<p>High doses of Decitabine are toxic, but low doses have anti-neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications, like DNA methylation, are reversible but mitotically heritable. The last means that epigenetic marks are passed down to daughter cells in cell division. Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects beyond the period of drug treatment because of this mitotical heritability. The altered methylation marks in one cell will be inherited by all her daughter cells <span>until they are actively erased.</span></p>
<p>There are two periods of active epigenetic reprogramming known as sensitive periods. One of them is the development of primordial germ cells. The other one is the preimplantation and early implantation period. During these periods epigenetic marks are erased and new ones are laid down. Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because drugs that alter the epigenome can disrupt the process of epigenetic remodelling, like it sometimes happens in the processes of in vitro fertilization, ICSI and cloning.</p></div>
