    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is usually resulting in silencing of genes. In cancer cells CpG islands (and shores) are more often methylated than in normal tissue, we say that CpG islands are hypermethylated. This usually happens at promoter regions of tumor supressor genes, effectively silencing these and thereby contributing to disease. And importantly, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so will be maintained in new daugther cancer cells. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in normal cells to silence these regions and contribute to genomic stability. In cancercells, such regions are often hypomethylated (not methylated) which results in genomic instabillity by e.g. allowing for illigitimate recombinations between repeats. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoter regions is also present in cancer cells and contributes to disease by activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting means loosing or gaining methylation of imprint regions, and can contribute to disease by leading to overexpression of growth promoting genes or underexpression of growth restricting genes. In the example of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the maternal allele is not methylated allowing for CTCF insulator protein to bind and disallowing enhancers to react with lgf2 gene which is silenced. The paternal allele is methylated so CTCF does not bind which allows the enhancers to get to lgf2 wich is active. In Wilm's tumour, imprinting is disrupted by hypermethylation of the maternal allele, resulting in expression of lgf2 from both alleles, hence overexpression of lgf2. This contributes to disease as lgf2 is an oncogene, a growth promoter, and the disruption of imprinting is mitotically heritable, so will be maintained in new cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It inhibits the DNMT which is responsible for laying down the methylation patter on daughter cells. The decitabine lowers the amount of methylation in daughtercells by making DNMT unable to lay down multiple methylations. This means that later generations of cells will have less methylation. It depends on cell-division to have an effect as methylation is only lowered in new cells, hence fast dividing cancer-cells are more affected than normal cells that divide less frequently. By lowering the efficiency with which the mehtylation pattern is copied to later generations, tumours can not develop as effectively as new cells does not have the methylation pattern needed to continue development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, changes in DNA methylation in one cell will be preserved in all daughter cells, and hence the epigenome would be changed in all future generation cells. DNA methylation patterns are naturally erased and recreated in what is called sensitive periodes of development. The first sensitive periode in humans are the periode from fertilised egg to blastocyst, and after that when primordial germ cells develop. Traeting patients during sensitive periodes is inadvisable as reconstruction of the methylation patterns would be distorted/disrupted with potentially devestating effects on future generations (in the case of germ cells) or all future cells of the organism when the fertilised egg develops to blastocyst, these few cells are the orign of all future cells so wrong DNA methylation patterns will be inherited by all future cells.</p></div>
