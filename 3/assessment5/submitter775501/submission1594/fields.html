    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The cancerous methylome differs from DNA methylation found in normal cells in at least 2 ways.  One involves CpG islands, where these marks are key to cell differentiation, imprinting and X-inactivation.  Normally, promoters are kept mostly clear.  But in cancer these regions become hypermethylated,. resulting in silencing of the underlying gene.  When that gene is a growth inhibitor or tumor supressor, this abnormality can contribute to cancer.</p>
<p>A second alteration is observed in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Hassler and Egger report that the normal pattern of DNA methylation here is thought to "repress transcriptive noise, inhibit anti-sense transcription, direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing."  In cancer, these regions are found to be hypomethylated.  The resulting disruption of those processes causes disregulation of gene profiles and chromatin compartmentalization.</p>
<p>These methylome modifications are known to be more common than genome mutations in cancer.  Futher, they are mitotically inheritible.  Thus, abnormalities accummulate over time, exposing the epigenome to multiple hits.  This picture of vulnerability conforms with the Knudsen Hypotheses.for cancer etiology.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruptions to imprinting found in Wilm's tumor are thought to contribute to cancer.  The proposed mechanism involves methylation at the ICR locus of the H19/lgf2 cluster.  Normally the paternal allele has methlated ICR, resulting in H19 silencing and lgf2 expression.  The maternal allele has unmethylated ICR enabling CTCF binding at the site resulting in H19 expression and lgf2 silencing.  In Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR is found to be methylated.  The result is a double dose of lgf2, which is a growth promoter.  This in turn causes such cells to grow at a faster rate, which is a property associated with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitibane is a drug in the class of DNA demethylization agents, acting to hypomethylate DNA by interfering with DNA methyltransferase.  This appears to result in an anti-tumor effect by making subsequent generations of the cell line more susceptible to standard chemotherapies.  When used in conjunction with deacetylization inhibitors it may also prevent proliferation of cells where promoters for tumor suppressor genes have become silenced through promoter hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can produce effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment by virtue of the fact that those marks are preserved and reproduced by the DNA replication machinery.  Hence, once modified subsequent generations of the cell will all share the modification, and thus any therapeutic potential those mods may have engendered.</p>
<p>Since DNA methylation is crucial to cell differentiation and regulation, disruptions to the methylome can impact cell and organism viability.  This is especially true during the "sensitive periods" when methylation is either cleared (during germ cell genesis) or layed down (during differentiation within the blastoma).  Administration of these drugs during those periods would be expected to introduce abnormalities in either the zygote or developing fetus.</p></div>
