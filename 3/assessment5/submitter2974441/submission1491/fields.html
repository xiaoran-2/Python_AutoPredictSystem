    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells there is hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethlation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">CpG islands are used to regulate the expression of genes. In normal cells tumour suppresor genes are active (unmethylated), whilst in cancer cells they are silenced due to hypermethylation of the CpG island promoter. This includes DNA repair proteins, that fix errors in the cell's DNA, and control of the cell's life cycle, that stops cell division if there are errors in the DNA. With the loss of tumour suppressors, a cancer cell is able to divide without the normal restrictions, resulting in uncontrolled growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The hypomethylation at repetitive elements causes genomic instability. These repetitive elements are normally found in heterochromatin, but the reduced methylation opens the structure, making it more accessible. This can result in recombination between different repetitive elements, which alters the length of the chromosome, and transciption of the repetitive elements (which does not occur normally).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Similarly, the hypomethylation of intergenic regions can result in transcription of DNA that is normally not accessible, such as oncogenes. Oncogenes are genes that promote tumour growth or target tumour suppressors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA demethylating agent</span><span>. It inhibits DNA methyltransferases, such as DNMT1, thus reducing the methylation of the chromosome. Decitabine is used to target cancers where there is excessive hypermethylation. In the targeted cells there is hypermethylation of CpG islands, which can spread to the shores and</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> silence of tumour suppressor genes. By reducing the presence of DNMTs, the methylation does not spread to the CpG island shores, and the tumour suppressor genes remain active. The tumour suppresor genes then stop or slow the division of cancer cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In imprinted cells, there is differential methylation on the maternal and paternal strands.</p>
<p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele does not have methylation at the ICR. This allows the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR and block the enhancers, so H19 is expressed and not Igf2. T<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">he paternal allele has methylation at the ICR, so CTCF can't bind to the ICR and Igf2 is expressed by the enhancer. Also, the H19 promoter is methylated on the paternal allele (due to the localised spread of methylation marks), so it is not expressed.</span></p>
<p>However, in cancer cells, there is hypermethylation of ICRs. If this occurs in the H19/Igf2 cluster, both DNA strands are methylated and act like the paternal allele, causing over-expression of Igf2 and under-expression of H19. The hypermethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster is observed in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation change the epigenetic marks in the targeted cells. When these cells divide, the epigenome of daughter cells are identical to the mother cells, so the effects of the drugs are seen in subsequent cell generations. This means that the drug has a lasting effect beyond the initial use.</p>
<p>These epigenitic drugs should be avoided during sensitive periods, because this is when the epigenome is sensitive to the environment. There are two sensitive periods during the life of a person, early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. This translates to early puberty and early pregnancy, where the epigenetic marks of the offspring are cleared and replaced. Hence, if a person were to take epigenetic drugs during a sensitive period, the epigenome of their offspring may be negatively altered, causing disease in the offspring in the future.</p></div>
