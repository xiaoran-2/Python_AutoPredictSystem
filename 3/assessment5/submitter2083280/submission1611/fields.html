    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>
<p>CpG  islands usually are unmethylated. If they are, then chromatin becomes more condensed, which means that nearby gene cannot be ‘read’ and expressed. Therefore, methylation at CpG islands means silencing of gene expression. Also methylation of CpG  islands plays important role in X chromosome inactivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands are likely to be hypermethylated – as opposite to normal cells. However, which CpG islands (or sets of CGIs) are methylated depends on the tumor type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CpG islands methylation leads to silencing of gene expression. In case of cancer it’s usually silencing of tumor suppressors (methylated CpG islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes). CpG island hypermethylation progresses with tumorigenicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repeats are usually methylated, which helps maintain genomic integrity: prevents transposition and illegitimate recombination, avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cancer cells, repeats and intergenic regions are hypomethylated, and hypomethylation progresses with time and tumor growth. Hypomethylation of repeats is more common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability: illegitimate recombination (e.g. deletions, insertions and translocations), activation of transposition, repeats and cryptic promoters, disruption of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in oncogene activation and gene/microRNA expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most cancer cells show loss of imprinting. Imprint control regions can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated, which leads either to expression of the same gene from both parental alleles, or to silencing of both parental alleles. It can result in overexpression of growth promoting genes, or other way around - silencing of growth restriction genes.</p>
<ul><li>For example, in normal cell gene Igf2 expresses only on the paternal allele (due ICR methylation). <br /><br /></li>
<li>On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, CTCF (an insulator protein) binds with the unmethylated ICR and enhancers/promoters have access to H19 gene. Therefore, H19 is expressed, Igf2 is silenced.  <br /><br /></li>
<li>On the paternal allele it's the other way around: ICR methylation blocks CTCF from binding, methylation spreads to H19 gene, H19 is silenced because of that, and enhancers now have access to Igf2.<br /><br /></li>
<li>When ICR on the maternal allele is hypermethylated, then double dose of Igf2 is expressed. It leads to childhood kidney disease (Wilm’s tumour).</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.<br /><br /></li>
<li>
<p>It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which leads to DNA hypomethylation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cancer cells, DNA hypermethylation leads to more compact chromatin and ‘switching off’ gene expression because of that. Decitabine incorporates into DNA and binds DNA methyltransferase (i.e. enzymes responsible for the methylation). Therefore, in the daughter cells normal level of gene expression and control over cell growth are eventually restored.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>
<p>Epigenetic state is mitotically heritable. It means that during cell division all epigenetic marks are copied to the daughter cell. Therefore, altered DNA methylation is inherited by the daughter cell as well. Because of that, drugs that target epigenetic machinery may have effects that last beyond the period of the treatment: epigenetic alterations caused by these drugs just passed from one cell to another during the cell division.</p>
</li>
<li>Sensitive period is a time of establishment of epigenetic marks, when the organism  is maximally sensitive to environmental influences.<br /><br /></li>
<li>
<p>Sensitive periods take place during embryonic and fetal development, infancy, early childhood, and adolescence. The germ cells development, for example, begins in fetal life, but they mature only during the puberty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Default">While epigenetic drugs seem to be very effective, we still don’t fully know about all their long-lasting effects (or side effects), so there’s certain wariness to their usage, especially with younger patients. It's known that damaging environmental exposures may occur during sensitive periods, and manifest itself immediately or much time later (e.g., harm to germ cells can affect an adult's own fertility as well as the health of the offspring). So, if the drug potentially has some unknown long-lasting effects, it’s better not to treat younger patients with it.</p>
