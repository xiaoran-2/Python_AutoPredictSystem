In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1.A substance known as JQ1, which inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocks the activity of a gene by the name of </span><em class="Italic">Myc</em><span>. </span><em class="Italic">Myc</em><span> encodes a protein called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation system. This particular transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes. Not surprisingly, then, when it goes wrong it is one of the most common causes of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Alterations in the DNA Methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restrctng genes and over expression of griwth promoting genes.</p>
<p>2. In maternal allele CTCF is un methylated due to binding to insulator and activity of enhancers on the H19 leads to the silencing of the igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>3. n paternal allele CTCF is methylated where CTCF is not binded to insulator and the activity of enhancers act directly on the igf2 and leads to the expression of igf2   </p>
<p>4. IN willm's tumor cell, there is expression of the methylation in the both maternal and paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> Decitabine belongs to class <span>DNA-demethylating agents of <span>epigenetic inhibitors. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect. This is how is here. According to various forms of gene regulation involvng  translation factors, the epigenetic changes passed to daughter cells  and next generation untill thet actively erased. Due to this effect the <span>epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span> Thus it is showing the anti-tumour effect. </span></span></span></span></p></div>
