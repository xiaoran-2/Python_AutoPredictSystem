<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer. DNA hypermethylation is frequent at CpG islands. Frequently found in gene promotors, CpG islands are in general unmethylated in normal cells. In tumors however, these CpG islands tend to become methylated causing gene silencing. In particular, CpG island methylation can be used by the cancer cell as a mechanism to inactivate tumor suppressor genes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In contrast with CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancer. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are often methylated which has an important role in genomic stability. The hypomethylation of these regions in cancer leads to genomic instability.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Loss of imprinting is common in tumors. IGF2 is an example of an imprinting gene. In normal cells, the IGF2 gene is only expressed through the allele inherited from the father. This occurs because the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele. IGF2 is present in a gene cluster together with H19. Which of these two genes is expressed (H19 or IGF2) depends on the methylation status of the ICR. When it is unmethylated, such as in the maternal allele, H19 will be expressed. When methylated, as in the paternal allele, IGF2 is expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In cancer, hypermethylation of ICR is commonly observed. Hypermethylation of the H19/IGF2 complex will lead to loss of imprinting of IGF2. IGF2 will then be expressed through both the paternal and maternal allele, resulting in overexpression and in excess cell growth since IGF2 is a growth promoting gene. This biallelic expression of IGF2, associated with hypermethylation of the ICR, has been observed In Wilm's tumor.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>           </p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is a  DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor. When a cell replicates during cell division, DNA-methyltransferase adds methylation to the daughter strand to maintain the tissue methylation pattern. Drugs like decitabine block the function of DNA-methyltransferase, reducing methylation. Because cancer cells divide more frequently than normal cells they will be particularly sensitive to the drug effects. Expression of tumor suppressor genes that were previously silenced by DNA-methylation of CpG islands in their promoter will in this way be restored. This results in a reducing tumor growth.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Alterations in DNA methylation patterns induced by epigenetic drugs are subsequently mitotically inherited, i.e. passed to the progeny cells. The epigenetic makeup might at the same time make the tumor cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Because these drugs are systemically administrated and then be available to all the cells in the organism they will alter the epigenetics of all the cells. This might have a negative effect especially during sensitive periods, such as gametogenesis. In younger patients, particularly those that are still developing germ cells the effects of using epigenetic drugs can be anticipated to be severe.</span></span></span></p></div>
