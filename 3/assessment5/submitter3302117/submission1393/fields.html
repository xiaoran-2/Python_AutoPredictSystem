    <div class="field-value"><p>Clusters of CpGs, known as CpG islands, are often found at promoters of genes and are usually unmethylated. When a CpG island is methylated it basically translates into silencing of gene expression. In cancer, there is disruption of CpG island methylation: hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands on tumor suppressor genes is commonly found, repressing these genes and as consequence, impairment of growth control and apoptosis in altered cells occurs. Contrary to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. It is thought they create genomic integrity by impeding genomic instability (prevent transposition, illegitimate recombination) and silencing cryptic transcription start sites between genes, as well as to protect the genome from transposable elements. Disruptions on methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements also aids in the occurrence of cancer, since the chromosomal instabilities produced by hyper/hypomethylation leads to deletion, translation phenomena commonly seen in cancer. Some other proposed mechanisms leading to cancer by means of hypomethylation are enhanced recombination, activation of endogenous retroviral elements and modulation of transcription factors at tandem DNA repeats. Aberrant methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements has also been found in senescent cells and not only in cancer cells. It is thought the process of “aging”, which is related to an adverse metabolic cell environment (i.e., reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial abnormalities), may also add up to the modifications of gene expression, especially in SINEs and LINEs and LTR-retrotransposons, sequences that possess transcriptional activity which have been thought to be cis regulatory elements. Thus, aberrant hypomethylation in these sequences may alter gene regulation activities leading to diseases other than cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, both genes are separated by an Imprinting Control Region (ICR) where an insulator protein, CTCF, binds and blocks the enhancers located on the H19 side to access the Igf2 gene. In the paternal allele, both the ICR and H19 gene are methylated, these blocks CTCF binding and allows enhancers to access <em>Igf2</em> and represses <em>H19</em>. On the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and binding of the CTCF is allowed. <em>H19</em> is then activated, whereas <em>Igf2</em> is repressed. Thus, <em>H19</em> is maternally expressed whereas <em>Igf2</em> is paternally expressed. In Wilm’s tumor, imprinting of the ICR is disrupted on the maternal allele and overexpression of <em>Igf2</em> by means of maternal activation occurs. Following the previous knowledge, when ICR imprinting is disrupted, that is, there is ICR methylation on the maternal allele, CTCF binding is blocked and <em>Igf2</em> is accessed by the enhancers located on the H19 side, thus activating <em>Igf2</em>. H19 regularly inhibits cell growth, whereas Igf2 promotes it. When there’s overexpression of Igf2 due to loss of imprinting on the maternal allele, the inhibiting role of H19 is lost and cell overgrowth ensues. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic mechanisms for gene regulation (DNA methylation, histone modification and remodeling and RNA interference) are somatically inherited and reorganized during gametogenesis. Several phenotypical effects arising from epigenetic modifications have been studied, cancer being the leading one. Altered epigenetic patterns and mutated epigenetic enzymes have been studied for the development of antitumoral drugs. Among such drugs, Decitabine, a cytosine analogue, is one of few with a known epigenetic effect that’s been FDA approved. As a cytosine analogue, decitabine is incorporated into the DNA, where it covalently binds the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT). This irreversibly inhibits the DNMTs, thus inducing DNA hypomethylation. As such, decitabine is included in the class of DNMT inhibitors. As heterogeneous DNA methylation has been found in tumors, where hypermethylation, and inactivation, of tumor suppressor genes is common, decitabine may lead to the reëxpression of such genes and eventually lead to apoptosis of the tumoral cell lineage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>With prolonged use of epigenetic drugs, epigenetic marks would be increasingly established in somatic cells during serial generations such that most of the cells in a specific tissue would eventually harbor them. Somatic inheritance and long-term effects would thus be assured. It is to keep in mind side-effects may be observed, though:  Environment can exert an effect on the epigenetic makeup, the time of occurence known as “sensitive period”. Two well-known sensitive periods exist in mammals: the period of primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period, where active remodeling of the epigenome takes place (brief periods of sensitivity arise during organ development, but are not as genomewide). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes has been found, that is, changes in the phenotypic expression independent of genotypic status may be transmitted among generations. As such, any environmental pressure (i.e., diet, temperature) during sensitive periods may affect the overall remodeling of the epigenome and produce long-term effects. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods would be inadvisable for it may add up to a higher risk of affecting epigenome remodeling and of inducing either widespread organic or tissue-specific alterations.</p></div>
