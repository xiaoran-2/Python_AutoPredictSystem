    <div class="field-value"><p>It is now accepted that dysregulation of DNA methylation is a major cause of cancer.  DNA methylation occurs at cytosine when it occurs in the sequence CpG.  In a number of mammalian gene promoters, areas of higher than normal CpG density known as CpG islands occur.  CpG islands are normally not methylated, regardless of the gene's activation state.  However, this changes in a cancer cell, where promoter CpG islands become hypermethylated, leading to downregulation of the relevant gene.  In many cancers, the silenced gene encodes a tumour suppressor or similar protective protein.  Many groups have undertaken profiling of specific hypermethylated sites within tumour cells in the hope that these could act as prognostic biomarkers and in some cases, DNA methylation profiling has been used used to define particular tumour subgroups. </p>
<p>DNA methylation does not only occur in gene promoters, but also in intragenic regions and repetitive elements.  In these cases, methylation is often associated with highly expressed genes and it is thought that it may act to silence alternative transcription initiation or splicing sites.  In cancer, the DNA becomes hypomethylated, which is speculated to lead to reactivation of repetitive elements and other drivers of genomic instability.  Both hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intragenic regions are also implicated in diseases other than cancer.  For instance, fragile X syndrome is caused by methylation of a CpG island near the FMR1 gene.  This methylation prevents expression of the Fragile X Protein, and disruption to normal neural development.  Studies in Type 2 diabetes have found that induction of hypomethylation correlates with a higher likelihood of developing the disease, and some think that detection of hypomethylation at certain sites could even be used to diagnose Type 2 diabetes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Another mechanism by which epigenetics can contribute to cancer is in the disruption of imprinting.  Imprinting is the process by which a gene is only ever expressed from the allele inherited from one parent.  For example, the Igf2 gene is only expressed on the paternal allele because several sites upstream of the H19 gene (the H19 imprinting control region, or ICR) are methylated.  This methylation prevents transcription of the H19 noncoding RNA and allows expression of IGF2 which stimulates cell growth.  The ICR is not methylated on the maternal allele, and H19 is transcribed so that the ncRNA is able to repress IGF2 expression.  In Wilm's tumour, loss of imprinting (LOI) of the Igf2 gene occurs as a result of hypermethylation of the H19 ICR.  This LOI leads to expression of Igf2 by both maternal and paternal alleles, resulting in excessive cell growth which eventually leads to cancer.  In addition to the growth promoting actions of Igf2 overexpression, there is evidence that the hypermethylated ICR allows for greater genomic instability by preventing transcription of the h19 ncRNA.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a DNA methylase (DNMT) inhibitor.  Treatment with the drug inhibits DNA methylation, leaving genes in a hypomethylated state.  In cancer cells, this hypomethylation leads to the reactivation of tumour suppressor genes such as p53.  Currently Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes such as CML.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the methylation state of DNA can have long term epigenetic effects.  Drug-induced changes to the chromatin could persist after treatment, until multiple cell divisions have diluted the effect.   This can be of great benefit to cancer patients, as it can allow a greater responsiveness to other treatments (e.g. chemotherapy) in addition to the direct effects of the epigentic drug.  However, this enduring epigenetic legacy can also be of potential concern, and there would definitely be periods during which patients should not be exposed to epigenetic drugs.  A sensitive period is that time when an organism is more acutely sensitive to environmental influences or stresses than at other times.  We know that epigenetically sensitive periods occur during early development of an embryo, therefore treatment with epigenetic drugs would be clearly counterindicated during early pregnancy. Animal studies have shown that maternal exposure to drugs or stress during pregnancy can alter epigenetic gene programming in the brain and correlate with neurodevelopmental defects in the progeny.</p></div>
