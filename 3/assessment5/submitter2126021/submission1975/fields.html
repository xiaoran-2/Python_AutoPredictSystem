    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG dinucleotides (cytosine followed by a guanine with a phosphate bond) islands are areas of the DNA genome that have more CpG dinucleotides than would normally be expected. These CpG islands tend to be associated with promoters in the genome - areas where transcription factors bind.  In the normal genome, CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation.  When CpG islands are methylated gene silencing tends to occur.  A normal function of methylation of CpG islands is in X inactivation.  CpG methylation (mitotically inheritable) is essential for X inactivation in normal cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands throughout the genome are hypermethylated and these CpG islands tend to be in the promoter regions for tumor suppressor genes. Therefore suppression of the promoters for tumor suppressor genes results in the silencing of the transcription for these genes and thus cell growth can occur unabated...resulting in cancer.</p>
<p>In normal genomes, intergenic and repetitive regions are the areas of the genome that methylated.  Methylated areas of the chromatin are compacted and thus protected from transcription.  Methylation in these regions tends to protect and maintain the integrity of the genome and protect the genome from transposable elements that can cause DNA mutations.  In cancer the intergenic and repetitive regions of the genome become hypomethylated and thus the normal protections from transposition and mutation </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>For the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is located between the two genes for Igf2 and H19. This imprint control region is paternally imprinted (methylated on the paternal allele).  On the maternal allele, a protein called CTCF binds to the "unmethylated" ICR.  When CTCF (an insulator protein) is bound, transcription of the long noncoding RNA H19 can take place. The H19 acts on the downstream "enhancers". On the paternal allele, methylation of the ICR prevents the binding of CTCF and thus methylation of the H19 region also occurs and H19 is silenced.  This silencing of H19 allows the enhancers to actually feedback upstream and activate or enhance Igf2 which is then expressed.</span></p>
<p><span>Igf2 is an oncogene and promotes growth.  In Wilm's tumor the imprint control region on the maternal allele is also methylated...thus Igf2 is being expressed by both the paternal and maternal alleles resulting in overexpression and twice as much Igf2...thus leading to growth and Wilm's tumor in the kidney.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.  It is a nucleoside analog and during replication is incorporated into the DNA.  DNA methyltransferases are responsible for maintaining the mitotic heritability of the DNA methylation.  After replication occurs, DNA methyltransferases recognize and methyl the unmethylated daughter strand. In the case of decitabine, the DNA methyltransferase irreversibly binds to the drug and thus cannot methylate the DNA. As DNA methylation is responsible for silencing the expression of tumor suppressor genes, if the DNA methylation cannot be maintained in the rapidly dividing cancer cells, then eventually the tumor suppressor genes would once again be expressed and tumor growth would be inhibited.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation of CpG islands can suppress the promoter regions of the tumor suppressor genes, uncontrolled growth of cells can occur.  DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable (in normal cells necessary for the maintenance of X inactivation).  Thus epigenetic marks (laid down by DNA methylation) will be passed onto daughter cells and thus have enduring effects on the resulting daughter cells.</p>
<p>There are two times during normal development when epigenetic reprogramming takes place, during the germ cell development and also during early embryo development.  These normal periods of epigenetic reprogramming are referred to as the “sensitive” periods.  Imprinted genes require methylation and for proper growth to occur, the must be methylated properly.</p>
<p>If patients were treated with, for example, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, the DNA methylation necessary for imprinting might not take place and this would cause abnormal development and probable death of embryos. </p></div>
