    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer might be provoked by alterations in DNA methilation patterns. In normal CpG islands near tumor supressor genes, the area is kept free of methilation, regardless of the activity state. However, in cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to be hypermethilated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene, in this case a tumor supressor, preventing for the cancer spreading to be stopped. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in normal cells there is methilation, which means inactivity, while in cancer cells there is no methilation (hypomethilation genome-wide), which then leads to genomic instability: illegetimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, there's no methilation on the mathernal allele, which means that the CCTF is active, and the enhancers act on H19, which will be expressed, whie Igf2 is silenced. In the paternal allele, in normal cells, there is methilation on CCTF, so the enhancers act on Igf2, and the growth promoter is expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, what we have is a case of hypermethilation, where CCTF will be methilated in the mathernal allele, therefore allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2, which will be expressed. The patient will have a overdose of Igf2, which is characteristic of cancer cells..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA Methilase Inhibitors (DNMTi). It binds irreversibly to DNMT after they re incorporated into DNA, therefore are replication dependent. Decitabine will prevent the cell from preserving its epigenetic marks (DNA methilation, in this case) after mithotic division. Once this is lost, it won't be recover, so the daughter cells will be hypomethilated.</p>
<p>Decitabine may have an anti-tumour effect by removing the methilation near tumour-supressor genes, which will then be activated.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because, once the epigenetic marks are erased, they do not return: all daughters and grand-daughters cells will be free of those marks. Because of this, treating young patients, or pregnant woman, should always be avoided, because there are germ cells in development, and any change in the epigenome would be kept and would probably have disastrous consequences (infertility), . There are 2 sensitive periods of development: primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm, and preimplantations and postimplantation periods. Like I wrote before, treatment should be avoided during these two periods.</p>
