    <div class="field-value"><p>      Normally, DNA methylation at CpG islands results in a more tightly bound, heterochromatic DNA arrangement. This arrangement prevents genes that are meant not to be expressed in a given cell to remain silent, as the cellular machinery necessary for transcription is not able to access the DNA near the methylated CpG islands. In cancerous cells, methylation as a whole is decreased throughout the genome. This includes introns, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements. However, hypermethylation at certain CpG islands also a characteritic of cancerous cells. DNA hypermethylation at CpG Islands contributes to disease by causing a more tightly compacted chromatin structure near promoters of tumor suppressor genes, prohibiting transcriptional machinery from accessing these genes. This results in the silencing of tumor suppressor regions. This lack of tumor suppressing gene expression can allow cancerous growths to form.</p>
<p>      The main function of methylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability. Methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genetic stability because it causes a closed, heterochromatic arrangement of DNA. This prevents illegitimate recombinations of chromosomes with similar nucleotide sequences as are commonly found in repetitive elements.</p>
<p>      In cancerous cells, there is hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, leading to a more loose, euchromatic packaging of DNA in these regions. This Hypomethylation and euchromatic arrangement of the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to increased activation, potentially allowing copying and transposition of repetitive elements or intergenic regions into other parts of the DNA. This can cause disruption of proper expression of a gene they transpose into. This can also lead to aberrant activation of neighboring genes, such as in the example of activation of the cryptic promoter in the agouti mice. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      On the Paternal allele the Imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated, CTCF binds to the ICR, allowing the enhancers to act on H19 instead of Igf2, leaving Igf2 silent. Conversely, when the ICR is methylated, as on the paternal allele, CTCF does not bind to the ICR. Therefore the enhancers act on the IGF2 promoter instead, causing expression of IGF2, and not H19.</p>
<p> With loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation on the maternal allele, causing Igf2 is expressed from both the maternal and paternal alleles. This double dose of the growth-promoting Igf2 results in Igf2 overexpression, which in turn causes aberrant increases in cell proliferation, which is the cause a childhood kidney tumor known as Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitadine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It has an anti-tumor effect by activating tumor supressors through hypomethylation of CpG Islands. The anti-tumor effect is caused particularly by demethylation of CpG Islands around the transcription start site of genes that are involved with tumor suppression.</p>
<p> Decitadine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Decitadine is a nucleoside analog, and is therefore incorporated into the DNA during replication. It binds irreversibly to DNMT, preventing it from reestablishing methylation in the DNA strand that did not receive the methylated parent strand, preventing the normal mitotic heritability of methylation. This causes a more euchromatic arrangement allowing transcriptional machinery access to DNA necessary for tumor suppressor genes to be transcribed. With DNMT inactive, methylation is diluted with each cell division. This allows a gradual activation and expression of tumor suppressor genes, ceasing or slowing the cancerous cell proliferation, that is the tumor growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation alteration can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is mitotically heritable as long as DNMT is free and active. This means that if DNA methylation is altered in cell(s), that alteration will be passed on to all daughter cells from the original cell(s) with the original altered DNA methylation. Sensitive periods are periods of time in which active rearrangement of the epigenome is taking place where the environment may have an effect on epigenetic control. In mammals, the two main sensitive periods are the time from primordial germ cell development through the time that production of mature egg and sperm cells begin, and the pre-implantaion through early post-implantation periods. Treating patients during sensitive periods is not a good idea because the epigenome is so malleable during this time. Therefore treatments aimed to create epigenetic changes may have more widespread, permanent changes than desired, resulting in potentially very negative consequences in long-term health.</p></div>
