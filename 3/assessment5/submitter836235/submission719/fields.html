    <div class="field-value"><p>The unmethylated CPG islands are CpG dinucleotides grouped in clusters associated with regulatory regions of genes..  In normal cells, CpG islands are kept  free of methylation irrrespective of their activity state.  Methylation is normal and  has a role in x-inactivation, genomic imprinting, and the formation of heterochromatin. Thus stability is maintained so the genetic/epigenetic processes proceeed without disruption.</p>
<p>Cancer cells undergo hypermethylation of the CpG islands (found in 60% of the promoters).  If these promoters happen to be in tumor supppressor genes (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair), the genes will be silenced, with the ensuing inability of the genes to kill the cancer cells. Conversely, hypomethylation of CpG islands can lead to the increased production of cancer cells when they are associatted with oncogenes.</p>
<p>Diseases.  CpG hypermethylation of the11beta-HSD-2 has been associated with an increase of high blood pressure.  Hypomethylation of the gamma-globin chain gene leads to development of sickle cell anemia through increased production of fetal hemoglobin.  This is done by overexpression of the gene in the first case, and underexpression in the other, which leads to protein disregulation</p>
<p> DNA is normally methylated at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity.   DNMT1 null cells are unstable.   DNA methylation silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. At repetitive elements DNA methylation also maintains genomic integrity by silencing and mutating repeats to prevent transposition  by silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and by methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination., In short, the function of  the DNA methylation is believed to be the protection of the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p>There is hypomethylation in the above regions, which leads to genomic instability, and thus, cancer (characterized by deletions, reciprocal translocations, and insertions) if this instability inactivates tumor suppressor genes.  With regard to disease. if the intergenic regions and repeats are not silenced , the resulting translocations and transcriptional interference might hinder the expression of proteins related to gene function</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele the H19 long coding RNA is expressed in normal cells.  The ICR is non methylated, and is bound by a protein called CTCF (an insulator protein). This proteins binds to the ICR and  orevents the enhancers to act on the  maternal Igf/2, resulting  in the enhancers'  acting on H19 to increase H19 expression.</p>
<p>In the  paternal allele, the ICR region is normally methylated, so CTCF can not bind to it,  The DNA methylation proceeds to  spread to the H19 long coding RNA, silencing it.  The enhancers can then act on Igf/2 to activate it.</p>
<p>In Wilmur's tumor, both ICRs, maternal and paternal,  lose their imprinting.  This results in hypermethylation of the ICRs in both paternal and maternal alleles and the activation of the Igf/2 with a double dose of the Igf/2 growth promoters.  This increase in growth factor is the cause of Wilmur's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The use of  epigenetic drugs that limit the use of DNMT,  such as DNMTi's, can decrease the amount of methylation that cancer uses at the CpG islands to prevent apotptosis and thus cell death. By disrupting the use of cancer cells of this mechanism, there is a higher probability that the chemotherapy will be successful.  DNA methylation can alter the expression of the genome, and thus, of the epigenome, since both act upon each other,  leading to  the hypermethylation of repeats and intragenic regions which result in permanent changes to the genome through translational errors and translocations, which in turn, modify  the epigenome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive period: the time where  there is clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. It happens in the maternal/paternal genomes during  PGC development  and early embrionic development, Imprinted genes don't undergo reprogramming or clearing  during early development, but do undergo clearance/reprogramming during PGC development. PGC and early development stages are crucial since in both epigenetic programming takes place. In the PGC stage (where imprinting is being reprogrammed), one should be careful, since damage to imprinting could happen,  resulting in  Wilbur's tumor. Sensitive periods occur when DNA methylation is being established in many genes, including  tumor suppressor genes. Improper methylation in the promoters of the latter genes during these periods may result in tumorgenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitor.They are nucleoside analogs, that bind to DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA.  Thus, they are replication dependent.  By binding to DNMT, they inhibit DNA methylation.  However, the inhibition is not linear. At small doses the effect of the demethylation increases, but at larger doses, in spite of an increase of Decitadine, the demethylation effect begins to decrease.  The reason for this decrease is that at high levels, the drug is very toxic.  The reason that it is effective, especially in myelodisplastic syndrome, is that this syndrome is associated with hypermethylation of the CpG islands, so the inhibition of said methylation is effective.  Thus, the inhibition of methyltransferase,, by limiting the ability of cancer cell to recruit methyl groups to silence the promoters in genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) limits the growth of tumor cells.</p></div>
