    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions that have a high CpG density and are found in about 60% of promoters. In normal condition, they are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. Small subset of CpG islands are dynamically methylated between cell types, most retain unmethylated status. Methylation at CpG island triggers silencing of the underlying gene expression - tumor suppressor gene. Therefore this will lead to alterations in controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair, resulting in cancer.</p>
<p>In the other hand, methylation usually occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity. The same thing applies with repetitive elements since methylation at it silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, prevent illegitimate recombination, and relates to replication timing. Hypomethylation at these regions will lead to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, which in turn will resulting in&lt;Ma cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and also known as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine.</p>
<p>Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation <em>in vitro  </em>do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. Disruption or loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.</p>
<p><em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster is located at chromosome 11 and regulated by insulator model. This cluster is paternally imprinted, which means methylation occurs in paternal allele. When this happens, imprinted control region (ICR) at maternal allele will bind to CTCF, an insulator protein which insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers. Enhancers then can act to <em>H19</em> freely. When methylation does not occur in paternal allele, chromatin will go heterochromatin state. There will be no CTCF bound to ICR, enhancers then will directly act to <em>Igf2</em>.</p>
<p>Beckwith Weidermann syndrome is a syndrome that is caused by this imprinting disruption. In this syndrome maternal allele acts like paternal allele, result in upregulation of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene that promote growth. It will cause fetal and postnatal overgrowth, macroglossia, and predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumor like Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. When drugs use this mechanism to treat tumour cells, the changes in the epigenetic marks will also be passed on until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. But in the other hand, there is an epigenetic reprogramming. Epigenetic reprogramming is a clearing of epigenetic marks. These marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. Period when epigenetic reprogramming occurs is called sensitive periods, like primordial germ cell and gametes and preimplantation periods.</p></div>
