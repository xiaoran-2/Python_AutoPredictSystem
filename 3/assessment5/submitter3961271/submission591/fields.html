    <div class="field-value"><p>There is DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands in normal cell, so this means their is really no methylation in general at CpG island, but the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and intron of genes, and one of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability. Whereas in cancer cells, CpG Island is more likely to be methylated than in normal cells i.e we found CpG island Hypermethylation at this region while the rest of the genome in general incuding the repetitive and intergenic elements and the intron of genes are hypomethylated. As cancer is a consequence of both epigenetic and genetic abnormalities, the two major feautures observed are (1). inactivation of tumour suppressor genes (2). activation of oncogenes (growth promotor). Therefore the  disruption in DNA methylation at CpG Island (Hypermethylation) is associated with gene silencing, which occurs really frequent in tumours, and this is a very effective way of silencing a tumour suppressor gene, since they are inactivated in cancer, also DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which means this is a very good locking down mechanism interms of epigenetic silencing. Notable examples of DNA hypermethylatioon associated with single gene include RB in retinoblastoma which is a heredictory cancer, MLHI in colorectal cancer and BRCAI in breast cancer etc.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic and repective elements contributes to disease as a result of hypomethylation (i.e they have less methylation) at these locations as stated earlier, because this leads to genomic instability and this instability arises from illiegimate recombination between repeats ( reciprocal translocation), activation of repeats and transposition, this means that the repeats have the capacity to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome, thereby disrupting the coding region of a gene and finally activation of crptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation pattern of imprint control region will determine whether the gene is maternally or partenally imprinted.  On the paternal allele where the inprint control region is methylated, CTCF (is an isulator protein) no longer bind, therefore their is no insulator action then these enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2 expression in partenal allele. (note that H19/Igf2 Cluster are found closely linked on the human chromosome 11 and its controlled by enhancer blocking.) While on the maternal allele, when this imprint control region is unmethylated, it is bound to the insulator protein which means it is able to insulate CTCF's  binding insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancer. because its insulating these Igf2 these enhancer are now free to act on H19 on the maternal allele and hence H19 expression, also Igf2 will be silenced.</p>
<p>In wilm's tumour, what is abserved is loss of imprinting, that consequently result in hypermethylation of the imprint control region and therefore loss of expression of growth restricting genes, and overexpression of  Igf2 both maternal and paternal gene. Therefore in most cancers alteration in DNA methylation at Imprint control regions at H19/Igf2 cluster (hypomethlation or hypermethylation) can results in upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting gene).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltranferases (DNMT1) inhibitors, which is a nucleoside analogue and was approved by FDA for the treatment of myeoldysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. DNMT is normally an enzyme that catalyzes the tranfer of a methyl group to DNA, thereby ensuring DNA methylation. DNMT maintains this methylation process that preserves DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication, and as DNA Methylation funtions to maintain genomic stability in cells. Therefore in the presence of DNMT1 inhibitor( Decitabine), tumour suppresor genes which was silenced by DNA methylation during tumour formation will be re-expressed or re-activated.</p>
<p>Lower dose Decitabine causes DNA methylation, thereby having a very good antitumiur effect. In this case, DNmti Inhibitor get incorporated into DNA upon replication and the DNA methyltransferase come to bind irreversibly to the nucleotide to copy methylation to the daughter strand. since this mechanism is cell replicating dependent, tumour cell which are rapidly dividing are affected.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in the promter region of a gene has been associated with decreased transcriptional activity, because it can Inhibit the binding or transcription factors directly by masking the DNA.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period when an environmental effects affects gene expression.  These environmental effects can be through altered diet or chemical egents and it can results in hypomethylation or hypermethylation as the case maybe. These periods are also when epigenetic marks (DNA methylation and Histone tail modification) that are been laid down in one lifetime are wiped off and to ensure that subsequent generation will have totipotency.</p>
<p>These periods are identified as the preimplantation or early embryonic development i.e the period before embryonic implant that makes a placenta, whereby DNA methylation can be actively and passively demethylated in the genomes.The second sensitive period is the primordial germ cell development, in this case DNA methylation we have differential resettting in spermatogenesis vs oogenes.</p>
<p>Therefore treating patient during these sensitive periods would disrupt epigenetic reprogramming that always ensure clearing of epigentic marks and can also results or re-activate CpG island hypermethylation or DNA methylation at the intergenic and repetitive element of the genome, which is commonly seen in cancer cells and these effects can last beyond the period of the drug treatment.</p></div>
