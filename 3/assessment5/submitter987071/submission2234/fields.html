    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation at CpG island silences the gene expression.</li>
<li><span>In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene (Egger et al.)</span></li>
<li><span><span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA (Li et al., Yoder et al)</span><span>.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing(Ball et al, Manuakea et al, Shenker et al, Aran et al).</span></span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The paternal allele is methylated and and blocks binding of CTCF and thus enable the expression of enhancer and promote Igf2's expression from paternal alleles.</li>
<li>The maternal allele is unmethylated and is bound by CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancer.</li>
<li>In Wilm's tumor, the loss of maternal like allele and appearance of two paternal like allele leads to expression of two Igf2/H19 cluster, leading to overdosage of Igf2 (oncogene) and no expression of Cdkn1c ( tumor supressor).</li>
<li>Disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 leads to fetal and post-natal overgrowth as unable to express supressor; furthermore can leads to macroglossia and predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>hypomethylating agent</li>
<li><span>hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase</span><span>.</span></li>
<li>Many cancers are caused by hypermethylation and silence of tumor-supressor genes and therefore by demethylation using decitabine can lead to production of more tumor-supressor due to decrease of silence of genes.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>epigenome is heritable and can pass on during cell division to daughter cells.</li>
<li>A sensitive period is period of cell division which epigenetic changes are passed on until they are actively erased. </li>
<li><span>Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span></li>
<li><span> It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma (solid tumours are harder to treat, because the drug has to penetrate them). And, second, some of the participants in Dr Baylin's study who did not show much response to the trial itself then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next (Economist).</span></li>
