    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are often at the promoters of genes, are usually unmethylated except in a small number of specific cases. DNA methylation of CpG islands causes silencing of gene expression and is seen in certain cell types and in X chromosome inactivation. The methylation leads to gene silencing by condensing the chromatin structure and prohibiting transcription factor binding. In cancer there is hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. The CpG islands affected vary with tumour type and an increase in CpG island methylation is seen as the cancer progresses with time and often indicates poor prognosis. Tumour suppressor genes are usually involved in regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair and so when they are silenced uncontrolled cell division, resistance to cell death and other hallmarks of cancer occur.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated which is thought to help maintain genomic stability, for example by preventing transposition, or transcriptional interference from cryptic promoters. Methylation will also result in compaction of the chromatin which will prevent illegitimate recombination from occurring. In cancer there is genome-wide hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements which leads to genomic instability. Recombination may occur between repeats that would have been prevented if they were methylated. This genomic instability may result in deletions, insertions, or reciprocal translocations. Alternatively, hypomethylation of strong promoters may affect the transcription of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster DNA methylation at the imprint control region (ICR) blocks the binding of CTCF an insulator protein. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to the promoter of H19 silencing it. The downstream enhancers can then reach Igf2 and activate it. On the maternal allele there is no methylation of the ICR and so CTCF is able to bind to it. In this case H19 is expressed and the downstream enhancers are unable to activate Igf2. In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting and the ICR is hypermethylated on the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele resulting in the over expression of Igf2, i.e. it is expressed on both alleles, and no expression of H19. Igf2 encodes for a growth promoting hormone, insulin-like growth factor 2, and so higher levels of this in the cells is likely to result in uncontrolled growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It is a nucleoside analogue, i.e. its chemical structure is very similar to cytidine, and during DNA replication it becomes incorporated into the DNA. DNA methyltransferases will then bind to decitabine irreversibly and will no longer be able to methylate DNA. Since this process happens during replication, rapidly dividing cancer cells will be more affected than normal cells. At high doses decitabine is highly toxic to all cells but at low doses it results in decreased DNA methylation and has been shown to have an anti-tumour effect. Many cancers are associated with hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, resulting in their silencing, so it is likely that decitabine is effective by reducing the methylation of these areas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable: after DNA replication DNMT1 copies the methylation onto the daughter strand, therefore methylation patterns are maintained through cell division. There may also be transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation so any changes in methylation could be passed on to future generations. There are sensitive periods when epigenetic marks are being established or reprogrammed which are susceptible to disruption by environmental factors. These sensitive periods are during early (pre-implantation) embryonic development and primordial germ cell development (which occurs mid-gestation). There is also evidence of a sensitive period during childhood, just before puberty, in relation to environmental factors such as food supply and smoking. Treating patients during sensitive periods, such as pregnancy and pre-puberty, would be inadvisable because changes in DNA methylation may then be passed on to future generations.</p></div>
