    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate the expression of the neighbouring genes (silencing and/or enhancing depending on the case). In the case of cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands is disrupted at specific locus which differ by tumour type (set of genes) and not genome-wide. In cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to the disease by silencing the neighbouring tumour supressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements increases the stability of the genome and prevents the expression of some genes by hiding cryptic promoters. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted genom-wide in cancer, essentially in repetitive elements. It contributes to the disease by increasing the genomic instability in the case of repetitive elements. The genome instability favours the occurence of illegitim recombinations. On the other hand, DNA methylation at intergenic region activates cryptic promoters and enhances the expression of oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is normally methylated at the ICR preventing the insulator CTCF from binding at the ICR. Thus, enhancers downstream are activated and promotes the expression of the Igf2 gene which is a growth factor. The maternal allele is normally unmethylated at the ICR allowing the insulator CTCF to bind at the ICR. Thus the H19 gene (growth restrincting gene) is expressed and the enhancers downstream are repressed. As a consequence the Igf2 gene is silenced. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is anormally methylated at the ICR so the two alleles of the Igf2 genes are expressed resulting in overproduction of the growth factor encoded by this gene and enhancing the tumour growth. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT (di-nucleotide methyl transferase) inhibitor (DNMTi) as well as 5'-azacytidine (Vidaza).</p>
<p>Decitabine by inhibiting DNMT in a non specific way prevents DNA methylation, especially at CpG islands and thus precludes the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. By this mechanism, Decitabine has an anti-tumoral effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since this epigenetic modification is mitotically inheritable and therfore is transmitted to daughter cells by the way of cell division. A sensitive period owing to the epigenome, is a period when occurs the active or passive reprogramming of the epigenetics modifications such as X chromosome inactivation or imprinting of genes. The two sensitive periods of development correspond to the maturation of germ cells in the gonades and to the early development of the embryo (blastocyst). Treating patients with drugs that disrupts the epigenetic machinery during these period could have very severe side effects since it could interfere with the formation of germ cells (and thus could affect the descendance of the patient) and alter the development of the embryo. In this respect, the treatment of pregnant women with such agents should be forbidden.</p></div>
