    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation occurs at cytosine guanine dinucleotides (CpG). There are regions of high CpG frequency known as CpG islands located in promoter regions that are hypomethylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypermethylation is found at CpG islands in cancer cells and may cause repression of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of methylation at CpG islands may cause non-cancer disorders including Angelman’s syndrome (AS) and Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) caused by disruptions at the <em>Snrpn </em>cluster. In AS there is a failure of methylation of the PWS imprint control region (ICR) in the maternal allele resulting in transcription of the LncRNA Snurf/Snrpn from both alleles. This results in antisense transcription of the Ube-3a gene in the brain causing mental disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PWS is due to silencing of the PWS ICR in the paternal allele, LncRNA Snurf/Snrpn is not produced causing mental disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of intergenic regions promotes genomic stability through minimizing illegitimate recombination and transcriptional interference. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions reduces heterochromatin and increasing euchromatin. This will promote pairing during cell division resulting in illegitimate recombination causing chromosomal duplications, translocations, insertions and deletions that compromise cell function. The effect of oncogenes may be increased through multiple copies resulting from illegitimate recombination. Cryptic promoters will be functional causing up regulation of oncogenes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repetitive elements have strong promoters and the ability to change position in the genome or to multiply and for copies to locate elsewhere in the genome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Transcriptional interference results from strong promoters in the repetitive elements transcribing into functional genes. This prevents genes being transcribed normally. This may compromise the effectiveness of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Changing transposon location or locating copies of retrotransposons in other regions of the genome can result in insertions into tumor suppressor genes compromising their function.</p>
<p>Multiple copies of transposons across the genome will promote illegitimate recombination.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 are examples of parent of origin mono allelic gene imprinting. The alleles of these genes coming from the different parents are expressed differently due to differential imprinting of the imprint control region (ICR) shared by these two genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated so the blocking protein, CTCF, will not bind to the ICR. Methylation spreads to the H19 promoter silencing this gene. The downstream enhances up regulate the expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a cell growth promoter oncogene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The maternal allele ICR is non-methylated so CTCF binds to the ICR. Also, H19 is not methylated and encodes for an RNA. The downstream enhances are blocked by CTCF. This insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers so it is not up regulated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The upstream tumor suppressor gene, Cdnk1c, is activated on the maternally imprinted chromosome inhibiting tumor development. Cdnk1c is silenced on the paternally inherited chromosome as the Kcnq1 is not silenced and produces a LncRNA that silences Cdnk1c. </p>
<p>Cdnk1c can be silenced on the maternal if there is a loss of imprinting of the ICR in Kcnq1 allowing transcription of LncRNA. This predisposes children to cancer of the kidneys (Wilm’s tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of methyltransferases. The role of methyltransferases is to ensure that the daughter chromosomes have the same CpG methylation after mitosis as the mother chromosome. Consequently, decitabine will, after a number of cell divisions, result is in hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine irreversibly binds the methyltransferase after they are incorporated in the DNA inhibiting the action of the methyltransferase. It is, therefore, replication dependent. Cell division is commonly much more rapid in tumors than in normal cells so decitabine will impact selectively on the cells of cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine will have an anti-tumor effect if the consequence of CpG methylation is to silence the expression of a cancer suppressor gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are passed on without change during mitosis. This is mediated by maintenance DNA methyltransferases dnmt1. Treatments that alter the epigenome at any stage of development will to be passed on to daughter cells. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides can only be removed by active intervention that happens naturally prior to epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods when the organism undergoes epigenetic reprogramming. Reprogramming will insert epigenetic marks including DNA methylation and acetylation and histone modification that will govern future tissue differentiation, development and cellular homoeostasis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable. The epigenome required for normal tissue differentiation and development and for cellular homoeostasis is established during early embryonic development. Consequently, treatments that affect the epigenome during this sensitive period could result in abnormal tissue differentiation and development and cellular homoeostasis for the life of the organism. Epigenetic factors that will impact on the subsequent generation are established during primordial germ cell development. Treatments that impact on the epigenome during this stage may result in abnormal growth and development and cellular homoeostasis of the progeny of the embryo where the primordial germ cells are developing.</p></div>
