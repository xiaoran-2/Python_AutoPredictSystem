    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells there is little methylation at CpG islands. In cancers cells there is hypermethylation of the CpG islands (ie more methylation than in normal cells). Usuallly CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor supressor genes. And since DNA methylation is mitotichally heritable, once a tumor supresson gene is silenced by DNA methylation its daughter cells will inherit the tumor supressor gene in its silenced (methylated) state. If a tumor supressor gene is silenced, then the cell is more likely to be able to divide and proliferate uncontrollably (ie become a tumour). If tumor supressor genes are functioning properly, a cell cannot become cancerous; so some tumor supressor genes need to be silenced for a cancer to develop, and DNA methylation is one way this can ve achieved (the most common one).</p>
<p>In normal cells there the global methlyation levels are quite high (ie integenic regions, repetitive elements, and even introns are usually methylated. In cancers cells there is hypomethylation in these regions (ie less methylation than in normal cells). This is because hypomethylation of repeats &amp; integenic intervals leads to genomic instability in many ways. For example it allows illegitimate recombinations between repeats which leads to reciprocal translocations between non-homologous chromosomes (ie different chromosomes) [In normal cells the repeats are methylated and also the chromatin is tightly packed so recombination cannot occur between these regions.] Also when the repeats are not methylated they can be active ie get copied and transposed (copy is pasted in a different part of the gene) where they can dispupt the gene they land into, and/or activate neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For imprinted genes, only one in allele is expressed. This is the normal situation. With disruption of imprinting we can have either both alleles expressed, or neither of them expressed. And usually imprinted genes are involved in growth and development so it is not surpising that disruption of impriting can lead to tumours. </p>
<p>In the case of H19/Igf2 ICR, in normal cells the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele, hence the enhancers cannot promote the expression of H19, and promote the expression of Igf2 instead. In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and the enhacers promote the expression of H19, and not Igf 2 is produced by the maternal allele. So in normal cells, only the paternal allele expresses Igf2 and only the maternal allele exprsses H19.</p>
<p>One way the impriting can be disrupted is with hypermethylation of the ICR. In this case the maternal allele ICR is <em>also</em> methylated. So the maternal allele does not express H19, but instead it also expresses Igf2 2. Hence the cell does not express H19 at all, and over-expresses Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and its overexpression leads to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are now several drugs that affect epigenetic processes. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, so it helps remove methylation from genes that are over-methylated in cancer cells. More specifically Decitabine is a DNMTi, ie a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, and it inhibits the function of DNA methyltransferase by binding to its active site. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and is incorporated into the DNA. during DNA replication DNA methyltransferase binds to it irreversibly and cannot be released and copy the the methylation onto the daughter strand.So the action of such inhibitors is replication dependent, ie the cell needs to be dividing for these inhibitors to work. Since tumour cells are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, so they are affected more by the presence of these DNMT inhibitors than normal cells. In low doses these inhibitors cause DNA demethylation and so have an anti-neoplastic effect, ie they are killing tunour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotichally heritable, hence the daughter cells inherit the methylation pattern. Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic marks are established (rather than maintained). Two sensitive periods are: The period of early embryonic development ie upto the blastocyst stage. In this period there is epigenetic reprogramming, and all the epigenetic marks are cleared, and then the new marks -according to cell type- are established. The stage of primordial germ cell development in the embryo is also a sensitive period. Again the existing epigenetic marks are cleared, and then new marks are laid down on the gametes, depending on whether they to be are eggs or sperm. Another sensitive period is in young adults (8-12 years old) where production of gametes is happening (meiosis is completed, in sperm/eggs where meiosis was suspended). It is not advisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods, as the establishment of the correct epigenetic marks which is happening at the time will be affected, and this would have adverse consequences.</p></div>
