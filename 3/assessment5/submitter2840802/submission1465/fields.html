    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is required for the normal functioning of a cell. It is reponsible for genomic imprinting, X inactivation and fromation of heterchromatin. The normal function of methylation at CpG islands is to methylate parts of the gene like the repetitive elements and intergenic regions such that genomic integrity is maintained. In the intergenic regions, the cryptic promoters get methylated while the repititive elements like transposons, are also methylated. This is needed for proper functioning of the cell.  In Cancer, hypomethylation of the genome takes place, but there is hypermethylation of genes like tumor suppressors.The CpG islands of the promoters in the cells which are cancerous become hypermathylated and this silences the genes. If the DNA methylation of CpG islands in the tumor suppressor genes,transcription factor genes, CDK genes, genes responsible for apoptosis are disrupted, formation of tumors will result. Sometimes oncogenes are also activated by this process.  When genome is hypomethylated globally, this affects the satellite DNA, repititive elements and other gene bodies like introns such that they get activated and are capable of causing disease. If DNA methylation was disrupted at intergenic regions and repititive sequences, there would be an increased risk of  deletions, translocations, inversions and duplications due to the random insertion of transposons. If a certain gene that is transcribed in lower amounts comes under a strong promoter, more of the product can be produced. Especialliy if the product is a growth factor, there will be over proliferation of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA de methylation class of drugs. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome. This drug is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. In Cancer, a lot of specific genes which are important could be hypermethylated. For example tumor suppressor genes. If the CpG rich islands of the promoters of these kind of genes are hypermethylated, they will not be able to control growth a cell and a tumor may result. Hence a drug like this helps to demethylate such regions that are unecessarily methylated by inhibiting the enzyme that is responsble for adding methyl groups to DNA called DNA methyltransferase. Hence Decitabine can have an anti tumor effect.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome. This is due to the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic marks. If a parent cell has specific marks, all of the daughter cells will have them too unless it is erased. This propety is useful in cancer because once a cell is demethylated correctly, it will pass on the marks to the daughter cell. This will prevent the tumor or malignant cells from growing and spreading further. A sensitive period is that period where the epigenetic marks are being established or laid down in a cell. It is called "sensitive" because any disturbance from the environment or any other factor can lead to incorrect establishment of the epigenetic marks and this will lead to disease. The sensitive periods for the establishment of epigenetic marks are during the primordial cells to germ cell development and during pre-implantation and early post implantation. An incorrect establishment of marks could be caused due to the diet as well as the paternal or maternal evironment. Hence it would be inadvisable to give such drugs to pregnant mothers as it would mess with the development of the fetuses. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene is insulin like growth factor gene 2. It is a growth promoting gene when active. This gene is an imprinted gene and is expressed exclusively from the paternal allelle.Since Igf 2 is growth promoting, it promotes the growth of tumors. The H19 gene on the other hand, is active on the maternal chromosome. This is a tumor supressor gene. If it is inactivated, growth of tumors will be the result. The mechanism of the H19/Igf2 cluster is as follows : CTCF is an insulator protein that blocks Igf2 from enhancers on the maternal gene. This leads to H19 being active. On the paternal gene, the ICR is methylated, CTCF is absent and hence the enhancers activate Igf2 and H19 is silenced. In Cancer, the the ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster on both the maternal and paternal chromosome are methylated. This leads to biallelic expression of Igf2 and loss of H19 expression which promotes tumor growth. This is called Wilms tumor. </p></div>
