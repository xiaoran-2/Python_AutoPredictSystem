    <div class="field-value">Q1.1  you go into great unasked-for detail about methylation but you missed to answer the point. The very last sentence of the first paragraph is missing "(hyper)methylation in" at the beginning... perhaps and edition error? Sorry I have to grade you based on what I can read.

You say "... silencing them permanently." Since methylation is in fact reversible, "permanently" is too much of a strong word. I understand that you mean that is passed down to daughter cells but using that word does not convey that accurately.

You say "... Such genes are propagated through mitosis.."... of course the genes are propagated but that is irrelevant here... I guess you wanted to say that "such EPIGENETIC MARKS are propagated through mitosis".

"CRs" -> "ICRs"

"Aberrant de novo hypermethylation in transformed cells is another manner for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes"... if this is "another manner" where is the first manner then?  

"Epigenetically silenced genes by CpG island hypermethylation, alters the epigenetic memory." What you mean with "epigenetic memory" here? And why is the "silenced genes" the subject of that sentence?

When you talk about intergenic and repeat methylation in cancer and its effect you talk about CpG islands and tumor suppressor genesagain... not sure about the intention but it is possible that there are some misconception here... just saying, perhaps there is none.

Q2. 

There is a high correlation between lost of imprinting in that cluster and occurrence of Wilm's tumor but it not 100% certain which seems that is what you try to reflect in some parts of the text ("(Wilm's tumor)", "produces"); in some other parts you do it right ("contributes"). The second is the best approach, in scientific literature you have to avoid to make strong statements of that kind unless the link  or causality is shown to be 100%

Q4. 

"until they are actively mutated" ... what you mean with that? no clue.

You kind of give to conflicting definitions for "sensitive periods", I got the impression that you did not grasp the concept completely. 

You completely miss the last point of the question.

Beside the comments above, your works shows that you understood many of the concepts in the lecture series and reading material, congrats! however I think you need to go through the material again to consolidate your newly adquired knowledge on epigenetics.
