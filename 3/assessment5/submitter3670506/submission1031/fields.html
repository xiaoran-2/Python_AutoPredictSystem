    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation demarks the start and end of genes, provides structure to the chromosome, and leads to genes being expressed active or inactive. DNA methylation occurs symmetrically in specific 5 mC within CpG dinuclceotides and are maintained through cell division (~70-80% of CpGs) in somatic cells and in some non-CpG embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation intervenes in different epigenetic processes (X chromosome inactivation, imprinting, and heterochromatin formation). CpGs are often clustered into CpG islands at promoters regions and correlates with silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation patterns undergo two main changes: 1) locus specific (focal) DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes as well as loss of imprinting of imprinting control regions (CRs); and 2) genome-wide (global) hypomethylation in repetitive regions, satellite DNA, CpG poor promoters and ICRs loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>Focal hypermethylation in distinct subsets of promoter-associated CpG islands in cancer, affect tumor suppressor genes by silencing them permanently. Such genes are propagated through mitosis and are maintained in the malignant clone. Aberrant de novo hypermethylation in transformed cells is another manner for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Epigenetically silenced genes by CpG island hypermethylation, alters the epigenetic memory.</p>
<p>Normally intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and maintain structural integrity of the genome (silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, producing mutation of the repeats -meC to T- to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters and methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination).</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and can result in genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes that controls cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands.</p>
<p>Genomic instability traduces anormal recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition (seen as chromosomal deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions), activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neigbouring genes (oncogene activation).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs) does not necessarily mean silencing of gene expression and each ICR cluster has a different mechanism of action. Alterations at ICRs methylation is a common, early event often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>
<p>Paternal ICR methylation produces blocking of binding of CTCF (insulator protein). Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter producing H19 silencing. This action allows enhancers can access Igf2 producing Igf2 activation. </p>
<p>Maternal ICR hypomethylation provides Igf2 can be insulated by CTCF from downstream enhancers producing Igf2 inactivation and expression of H19.</p>
<p>Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster by maternal ICR hypermethylation provokes its disruption (Wilm's tumor), that means ICR methylation acts blocking from binding of CTCF to the H19 promoter producing H19 silencing; then enhancers can reach Igf2 producing Igf2 activation. The overexpression of Igf2 (from activation of both paternal and maternal alleles) produces Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to Wilm's tumor (nephroblastoma), producing upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene that promotes growing). Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is a macrosomic fenotype linked to Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 clusters. It is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele and results in loss of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor, growth suppresing) and upregulation of Igf2 (growth promoting oncogene).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an antineoplastic, DNA methylation inhibitor. Dicitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation of apoptosis. Decitabine acts similarly to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated to both DNA and RNA strands.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation and induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to critical genes for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells, the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attribuited to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA.  </p>
<div style="font-size:16px;font-family:serif;" dir="ltr"> </div>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (acute myelogenous leukemia -AML).  </p>
<p>Anti-tumor effect of the drug is by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase which attaches methyl groups to histones. Histone hypermethylation results in silencing of tumor supressor genes. The amount of histone overmethylation declined dramatically during drug use and also was found that reduces the proliferation of tumor cells while having no apparent effect on nearby normal cells.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively mutated. Once erased, they keep their new information for successive generations (tissue homogeneity). This principle might be applied to stop cancer growing cells altering genome methylation without having to kill sorrounding cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period in this case refers to the time necessary for an antineoplasic drugs to act once an epigenetic drug has produced an active mutation (changing genome methylation accordantly).</p>
<p>Epigenetic control is important throughout development. Sensitive periods of development are periods when epigenetic marks can be removed. Those sensitive periods are referred as 1) epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells and early development and 2) active remodelling of epigenetic marks during differentiation.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because changes (reprogramming) take time, require multiple cell division after the active mutation might be able to be expressed, tissues have to experiment complex processes that require multiple interelated systems, germ cell reprogramming require active reproductive processes.   </p></div>
