    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypo or hypermethylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in a loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or an overexpression of growth promoting genes. Igf2 is a growth promoter. H19 is a long noncoding RNA.  H19/Igf2 is an imprint cluster on human chromosome 11. </p>
<p>CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. Normally, on the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks the binding of the CTCF.  Without CTCF, methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it, and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it.  Therefore, Igf2 is only expressed from the paternal allele.  The maternal allele, an unmethylated imprint, is bound by the protein CTCF, insulating the Igf2, and silencing it. Because CTCF blocks the Igf2, enhancers loop over to H19 to enhance its expression, thus H19 is expressed from only the maternal allele (due to lack of methylation).</p>
<p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele’s ICR can become hypermethylated. This results in a loss of imprinting.  Now the mother’s enhancers can act on Igf2.  She begins to express Igf2, and now BOTH paternal alleles are expressing Igf2. This double dose of growth promotion can lead to childhood kidney tumors called Wilm’s tumor, and various other abnormalities.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are reversible. Decitabine is one of a class of drugs (that target epigenetic machinery) called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which can progress to become acute myelogenous leukemia. It uses nucleoside analogues which irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferases after they are incorporated into DNA.  The cancer cells will replicate and carry this inhibitor throughout, and will be more affected because they replicate so fast.  Use of Decitabine at lower doses has anti-neoplastic (anti-tumor) effects.  This over-methylation of certain areas has silenced many surrounding genes including those genes that are normally switched on to stop uncontrolled growth. Though the mechanism of action isn’t precisely clear, it is thought that Decitabine causes DNA de-methylation.  By removing the methylation from the DNA, it is thought that this allows the tumor suppressor genes to become active again, and can thusly work at suppressing the cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One must be cautious when treating patients with epigenetic therapies because altering the epigenome may endure from one generation to the next.  DNA methylation is important throughout the entire genome, and is mitotically heritable.  It is important in genomic stability.  Say one uses a drug that causes system wide de-methylation like Decitabine, and the lasting effects on the epigenome may later go on to cause another disorder/cancer because this DNA methylation is missing from the area of the genome where it is required to stabilize the genome or silence oncogenic marks. Sensitive periods are when the epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed and cleared. The DNA methylation is removed and is very low during early embryonic development and germ cell development (sperm/egg).  Without the DNA methylation to act as a protector/silencer, these periods could be greatly affected by outside influences.  Some forms of epigenetic inheritance may be maintained even through the production of germ cells (meiosis).  Altering DNA methylation could affect vital Imprinting, X inactivation, or other loci that may cause epigenetic disorders.  This type of therapy could affect your sperm/eggs, and thus your offspring.  This therapy should be used with caution on pregnant women, and younger patients who have a long life to live, and have not yet had children. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands (CPGI) are predominantly unmethylated independent of their activity state.  In cancer cells, promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.  Hypermethylation of their promoter CpGI will lead to silencing of Tumor Suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair.  This hypermethylation progresses with time. CpGI hypermethylation has been found in retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and gliomas.  Hypermethylation of CpGIs differs by tumor type. CpG Island shores also tend to become hypermethylated in cancer, and are a good indicator of gene expression.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells.  The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity.  At intergenic regions it also silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  Methylation of repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity by 1) silencing of repeats to prevent transposition so they won’t jump around the genome 2) mutation of repeats to prevent transposition 3) silencing of repeats, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and 4) methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination, as greater compaction makes it less likely to recombine.</p>
<p>In cancer the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome-wide hypomethylation where intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, and was found in all cancers ever studied. This hypomethylation leads to genomic instability.  It can lead to an abnormal karyotype with possible deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, or mutations.  It can lead to 1) activation of repeats 2) transpositions where they jump around the genome 3)  illegitimate recombination between repeats--the chromatin is usually tightly packed and heavily methylated to prevent this and 4) activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes.  </p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation in cancer is context dependent and can be driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation or chromosomal instability.  The stage of tumorigenesis also plays a role. </p></div>
