    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often located around promoter regions of genes frequently express in the cell. Methylation of the CpG islands lead to a stable silencing of gene expression. In a normal cell the CpG island tend to be hypomethylated, in contrast in a cancer cell the CpG are hypermethylated. DNA methylations at the intergenic region not only guarantee the genomic integrity of the chromosomes avoiding deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertion or duplication of the chromosomes, but also help to silencing cryptic promoter to avoid transcriptional interference and to silencing splice sites.  DNA methylations in the repetitive region also contribute to genomic stability by silencing the repetitive elements preventing the transposition, and hence the disruption of other genes in the genome, and avoiding the transcriptional interference and the transcription of the neighboring genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the DNA methylation pattern is inverted, there is a locus specific DNA hypermethylation and a genome wide hypomethylation. These DNA methylations are mitotically heritable. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands could lead to cancer because the CpG island are found in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes leading to the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene. The hypomethylation in the intergenic region and the repetitive elements leads to the genome instability that is seen in cancer. These hypomethilation ocurrs early in tumorogenesis and progress within time. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region in the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele but unmethylated on the maternal allele. Because of this the CTCF4 bind to the imprinting control region on the maternal allele leading to the expression of the H19 gene because the enhancer can act on the H19 gene. Igf2 allele is silent in the maternal allele and therefore there is no expression. On the other hand, on the paternal allele the methylation in the imprinting control region do not permit the binding of CTF4 and therefore the enhancer acts on the Igf2 gene. In Wilm’s tumor, the hypermethylation of the imprinting control region leads to loss of imprinting.  In this case, CTCF4 is unable to bind to the imprinting control region and therefore the enhancer acts on the Igf2 gene leading to an overexpression of the growth promoting gene, which would result in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genetic and epigenetic alterations could lead to the initiation and progression of cancer. Epimutations contrary to genetic mutations are reversible through pharmaceutical manipulation of enzymes that are responsible for DNA modification. Decitabine is a drug that hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase enzyme in a process that is division dependent. This hypomethylation would lead to the expression of tumor suppressing genes. As DNA methylations are mitotically heritable this drug could replace the changes in DNA methylation and elimiate the tumor without actually killing the cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment becase DNA methylations are mitotically heritable, so if the drug replaces the changes in the DNA methylation pattern all daugther cells will have the correct DNA methylation pattern. Periods in which an active remodeling of epigenome is observe, like the primordial germ cells, the gametes, the pre-implamentacion and early post-implamentation are said to be sensitive periods. Because cells during this period are constantly dividing if you treat a pating during this period you would affect the normal methlation DNA pattern and hence the division of the cells. </p></div>
