    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, between 60-90% of CpG islands are methylated in humans. Unmethylated groups of C-G's are often found clustered together in a formation called islands. The islands are unmethylated and so transcription is not impeded.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are often found hypermethylated, or showing higher methylation rates compared to non-cancer cells. The hypermethylation is locus specific, focused on islands and shores of tumor suppressor genes and Imprint Control Regions (ICR) that show loss of imprinting. The hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes leads to downregulation, or silencing, of the tumor suppressor genes and loss of a critical safeguard against unchecked cellular proliferation found in cancer.</p>
<p>In addition to CpG islands and shores, methylation is altered in repetitive regions and intergenic regions in cancer. These regions are hypomethylated, showing lower rates of methylation. This lower rate of methylation unwinds the chromatin, causing genomic instability. The genomic instability comes from illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, or activation of cyptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. If hypomethylation occurs in CpG poor promoters then oncogene activation can occur. Repetitive regions and intergenic regions are typically methylated in normal cells to silence gene regulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the Hg19 paternal allele is methylated and therefore silenced. This allows enhancers to activate Igf2 expression..</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the Hg19 maternal allele is not methylated and so enhancers activate expression of Hg19 and Igf2 is not expressed. Igf2 is silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated and Igf2 is overexpressed. The maternal allele is methylated, the paternal allele remains methylated, and so Igf2 is overexpressed through expression from both alleles, rather than only one allele.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Alterations in DNA methylations at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs), through hypomethylation or hypermethylation, can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In Wilm's tumor, overexpression leads to cellular growth and tumor formation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA demthylating agents. It is a DNMT inhibitor.</p>
<p>While the mechanism of action is still a bit unclear, Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that irreversibly binds DNMT's after they are incorporated into DNA and are therefore replication-dependent. DNMT transfers methyl groups to DNA and so by binding DNMT, Decitabine inhibits methylation.</p>
<p>Inhibition of methylation by Decitabine prevents inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. The tumor suppressor genes can then function normally to clear the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. It is possible that epigenetic treatments can effect changes that stop a cancer from growing without killing the cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic marks are being laid down or erased during normal development. Humans have 2 main sensitive periods: First, during early development as the fertilized egg develops into a blastocyst. Second, during germ cell development as the gametes are formed.</p>
<p>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because lasting changes, and possibly mutations or negative epigenetic modifications, would be made to the germ cells and passed on to children. Depending upon the exact modifications, negative impact could be felt for multiple generations.</p></div>
