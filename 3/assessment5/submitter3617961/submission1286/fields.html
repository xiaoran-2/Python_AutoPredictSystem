    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is caused by the addition of single methyl group to cytosine at position 5 in approximately 70-80% of CpG dinuceotides in somatic mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, DNA methylation is required for proper embryogenesis and development, as well as to maintain genomic stability. It is mitotically heritable and therefore faithfully passed onto dividing cells and maintained by DNA methytransferases. Alterations to DNA methylation such as genome-wide hypomethylation and/or tumor supression hypermethylation leads to abnormalities in epigenetic control resulting in diseases including cancer as explained below:</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA is methylated at intergenic and repetitive elements and un-methylated at CpG islands near transcription start sites. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark for gene silencing. By keeping CpG islands methylation-free, normal cells enable gene expressions for proteins responsible for normal biological functions. When promoter CpG islands and CpG island shores become hypermethylated, gene expression is blocked. Failure to express genes for normal biogical processes contributes to abnormalities. If tumor supressor genes are affected by CpG island hypermethylation, proto-oncogenes turn into oncgenes resulting in uncontrolled growth of tumor cells (for example: single tumor supressor hypermethylation as in RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT or affecting set of genes as in colorectal cancer CIMP).exons</p>
<p>On the other hand, genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements, that are hypermethylated in normal cells, could result in various abberations such as:</p>
<p>illegitimate recombination between repeats; activation of repeats and transpositions; activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes resulting in genomic instability.</p>
<p>Also, 5mC is prone to spontaneous deamination and point mutationto thymine hence making CpG dinucleotides to point mutations in human genetic disorders and single nucleotide polymorphisms in exons.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters could result in oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting results in parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression where maternally and paternally expressed genes share enhancers and their imprinting is governed by insulator located between them.</p>
<p>In H19/Igf2 cluster of normal cells, CTCF binds to sites within imprint control region (ICR) of the maternal allele and acts as an insulator blocking enhancers on the H19 side of insulator from Igf2 whereas methylation of ICR region on the paternal allele prevents CTCF from binding, allowing IgF2 to engage enhancers, methylate H19 promoter, and silence H19 gene. However, alterations in DNA methylation at ICR (hypo or hypermethylation) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or over-expression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICR region on the maternal allele will prevent CTCF from binding and behaves the same way as the parental allele causing over-expression of Igf2, a growth factor. This loss of imprinting caused by expression of the otherwise repressed maternal allele in addition to the paternal is associated with enhanced growth of increased cell proliferation resulting in tumor initiation or progression (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Wilm's Tumor etc.,)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dacogen (Decitabine) is a nucleoside  metabolic inhibitor / DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).</p>
<p>According to studies, MDS is caused by hypermethylation of many genes including p15 (tumor supressor gene), estrogen receptor, calcitonin etc.. Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis.</p>
<p>By inducing hypomethylation in neoplastic cells, Decitabine restores normal function to tumor supressor genes that might have been epigenetically silenced by hypermethylation thereby exerting anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are transgenerational. However, one has to be cautious on the timeliness of such treatments. In mammals, epigenetic marks are established during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. In addition, slow growth period (9-122yrs in boys / 8-10 yrs girls) is another sensitive period when establishment of epigenetic marks are sensitive to dietary changes. The clearing and re-programming of epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods shouldn't be disturbed in order to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>The advent of next generation sequencing, reduced cost of sequencing and analyzing personal genome have enabled effective diagnosis of diseases and enhanced opportunities for treatments that weren't possible a few years ago. Drugs can noe be used to treat diseases by reversing abnormal epigenetic changes caused by environmental factors in a more effective manner than widely used conventional methods today. However, one has to bear in mind various factors including the above-mentioned sensitive periods, patient's age, genomic and epigenomic knowledge, environmental, ethical, soci-economic factors, clinical validity and clinical utilityetc.,before weighing the best option for a positive outcome of curing diseases that are non-transgenerational ensuring not only safety of the existing patient but of future generations as well.</p></div>
