    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>In normal cells CpG islands</strong> are usually hypomethylated. This are located at promoters or in genes and controlling their expression. Therefore genes with similar function were activated and contribute to the maintenance of genome stability and regulating cellular processes. Only a few CpG islands are high methylated. The X-inactivation is a prominent example of CpG island hypermethylation associated with locked repressive heterochromatin.</p>
<p>A common feature <strong>in cancer</strong> is a locus specific hypermethylation of <strong>CpG islands</strong> and shores. This leads to a suppressive status and to <strong>silencing of tumor suppressor genes</strong>. CpG poor islands are hypomethylated which <strong>activates oncogenes</strong> leading to uncontrolled growth. The DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and leads to daughter cancer cells.</p>
<p>DNA hypermethylation at <strong>CpG islands</strong> repress expression of controlled genes. Methylation marks increases with age. CpG methylation also influences Histone methyltransferases completing the repressive heterochromatin. This results in loos of enzyme function and <strong>disease</strong>. CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) is a typical high methylation of a set of genes.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are highly methylated <strong>in normal cells</strong>. The function is the expressional silencing and the maintenance of genome stability. This protects of copy and paste of Retrotransposons. These are also silenced by RNA depending DNA methylation via piRNAs.</p>
<p><strong>In </strong>early stage of<strong> cancer</strong> <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> are genome wide DNA hypomethylated (epigenetic component). This results in genome instability (genetic component) and activation of special genes, generated by uncontrolled expression of such DNA elements.</p>
<p><strong>I<strong>n disease/cancer</strong> </strong>an activation of cryptic transcription starts or splice sites in<strong> <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> </strong>exists. Transcription of satellites causes DNA damage. The activation of repetitive elements leads to illegitimate recombination and ectopic gene expression and therefore to insertion, deletion and translocation of genomic regions in cancer. These are components altering genome architecture.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) of <strong>paternal </strong>imprinted H19/Igf2 <strong>cluster is hypermethylated</strong> in normal cells. This blocks the insulator CTCF. DNA methylation spread heterochromatin to thereby silenced H19. Enhancers bind <strong>Igf2</strong> resulting in <strong>expression</strong>.</p>
<p>The ICR of the <strong>maternal</strong> H19/Igf2 cluster is not methylated and bounded by CTCF in normal cells. This insulates Igf2 from interaction of enhancers and <strong>Igf2 is not expressed</strong>. Free enhancers lead to H19 lncRNA expression.</p>
<p>In <strong>Wilms tumor</strong> (lost imprinting) the <strong>hypermethylation at paternal and! maternal ICRs </strong>lead to double dosage of Igf2 expression, promotes tumour growth (oncogene). H19 gene is silenced by heterochromatin spreading.</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedemann (BW) is maternal transmitted from carrier mother to affected offspring. BW is caused by alteration in the expression state in linked H19/Igf2 and kcnq1 clusters, predisposing to Wilm’s tumor. This is caused by uniparental disomy, often by genetics (Insertion, Deletion) or in rare cases <strong>by disrupted imprinting</strong>. In this case the <strong>ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is hypermethylated at maternal and paternal alleles</strong> prevents CTCF from binding and heterochromatin spreading to silence H19. Thereby the maternal allele behaves like the paternal resulting in overexpression of Igf2, preferential overgrowth of cells, resulting in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> belongs <strong>to DNA methyltransferases inhibitors (DNMTi)</strong> and is an Azacytidine derivate (nucleoside analog of cytidine).</p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) become inhibited by irreversible binding Decitabine and cannot maintain DNA methylation by the impossibility of adding methyl group (-CH3) to Decitabine. Decitabine is incorporated by DNA replication. Therefore <strong>Decitabine decrease methylation</strong> after each cell division leading to non-selective DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>The epigenetic state can become changed. Epigenetic acting drugs can counteract cancer. <strong>Decitabine </strong>is incorporated into DNA especially by highly proliferating cells, like tumor cells are. This results in cell death likely by re-activation of tumor suppressor genes, which have <strong>anti-tumour effect</strong>. That’s why Decitabine is a chemotherapeutic drug. Decitabine is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Azacytidine in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and standard chemotherapeutics slow down solid tumour growth (The Economist, 2012).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation can </strong>reversible<strong> changed </strong>by <em>de novo </em>DNA methyltransferase 3 (DNMT 3) and drugs. This changes where recognized by interplaying histone modifiers (HM) and lncRNAs, which can feedback by recruiting DNMT and HM. DNMT 1 maintain changed CG methylation in daughter strands, changing gene expression. These epigenetic <strong>changes are </strong>stable passed during cell division also beyond the treatment, because of <strong>mitotically heritability</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive periods</strong> are times when epigenetic reprogramming occurs during embryogenesis/gametogenesis. In sensitive periods environmental changes can affect epigenetic status. Important epigenetic marks were reestablished here, rather than just maintenance in other developmental periods.</p>
<p>1. Early development of the inner cells mass of blastocyst</p>
<p>2. Primordial germ cell (PGC) development in the embryo</p>
<p>3. Germ cell (GC) development during life of man (spermatogenesis) and woman puberty (oogenesis)</p>
<p><strong>Treatment during these sensitive periods</strong> can initiate hits to the epigenome. The epigenome is sensitive to the influence of drugs. Therefore altered epigenetic marks become mitotically inherited. When treating cancer the resulting effects need to become considered, because every cell may effect. Diseases could be caused by aberrant imprinting and transgenerational abnormalities. Therefore treating during sensitive periods gives an inadvisable risk of diseases to the patient and further generations.</p></div>
