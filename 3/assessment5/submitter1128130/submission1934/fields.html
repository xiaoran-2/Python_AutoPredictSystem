    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. In cancer cells it's reversed: CpG islands are hypermethylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation in CpG islands causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This makes the cancer cells more viable.</p>
<p>Methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genomic stability. Hypomethylation causes genomic instability (e.g. abnormal karyotypes).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We have two alleles of (almost all) genes, one from mother and one from father. In some loci only one allele is expressed, and it depends on which parent it's inherited from.</p>
<p>H19 is normally paternally imprinted. Only maternal allele is expressed. In case of hypermethylation, imprinting is lost and lgf2 is overexpressed. This causes Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi, a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. DNMT is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator, which causes DNA methylation. Decitabine inhibits DNMT, i.e. it causes DNA demethylation. It affects on dividing cells. Since tumor cells divide often, it's effective on them.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Effects of epigenetic drugs can last beyond the treatment, because epigenetic changes are passed on when cells divide.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs have effects on all cells, not only cancer cells. While in older people these drugs can be very effective in prolonging lives and improving the quality of life, in younger patients they may have unwanted long term side effects, especially in developing germ cells (sensitive period). Epigenetic changes in germ cells are passed on to the next generation.</p>
