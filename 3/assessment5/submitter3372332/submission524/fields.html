    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison with normal cells. Changes include a regional gain and a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation.</p>
<p><span>CpG islands are characterized by CpG dinucleotide content of at least 60% of that which would be statistically expected (~4–6%), these islands are typically found in or near promoter regions of genes, where transcription is initiated.</span></p>
<p>CpG islands influence local chromatin structure (methylated CpG islands related to heterocromatin-densely packaged) and are envolved on regulation of gene activity (methylated CpGl related with gene silencing).</p>
<p>In <strong>normal</strong> cells CpG islands are <strong>unmethylated</strong> and are sites of transcriptional initiation in a promoter region of tumor suppressor gene leads to expression of the gene and inhibits cancer.</p>
<p>In most <strong>cancer</strong> the CpG islands are <strong>hypermethylated</strong>. The hypermethylation of CpG islands of the promoter region of tumor suppressor gene results in transcriptional inactivation (“silencing”) and leads to aberrant silencing of normal tumor-suppressor function.</p>
<p>In <strong>normal</strong> cells intergenic (non coding) and repetitive elements are <strong>methylated</strong> (causes silencing) and this is essential for genome stability.</p>
<p>In most <strong>cancer</strong> cells these regions (intergenic and repeats) are <strong>hypomethylated</strong> and this leads to  genomic instability caused by:</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">-illegitimate recombination between repeats because this regions are quite similar (repetitive) and cromatine is not densely package; This illegitimate recombination leads to genome mutations, </span><span class="dhighlight" style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">that can </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">cause </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">cancer.</span></p>
<p>-activation of repeats; repeats make a copy of themselves e jump around the genome or transpose. On the local where they jump they may disrupt the coding region of a gene or activate neighboring genes. The disrupt of the coding region <span> can </span><span>lead to the </span><span>activation of </span><span>an </span><span>oncogene </span><span>expression </span><span>or </span><span>silencing </span><span>of </span><span>a </span><span>tumor </span><span>suppressor gene </span><span>in either of</span><span> the </span><span>situations </span><span>increases the incidence </span><span>of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is a DNA-metiltransferase inibitor (DNMTi) , irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated in to DNA. The inibition of DNMT results in decreased DNA methylation. As hypermethylation of CpG Island is a epigenetic modification commonly found in cancer patients then decreased DNA methylation may decrease tumorogenesis. This is particularly important when it comes to tumor suppressor genes. A tumor suppressor gene, or anti-oncogene, is agene that protects a cellfrom one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is alteredto cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. The hypermethylation of CpG islands of the promoter region of tumor suppressor gene results in transcriptional inactivation (“silencing”) and leads to tumor. Use of Decitabine leads to hipomethylation of CpG Islands and the expression of tumor suppressor genes causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span> The imprinting control region (ICR) of H19 is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Usually, the <strong>paternal</strong> copy of H19 is methylated and <strong>silent</strong> while the<strong> maternal</strong> copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and <strong>expressed</strong> in the offspring cell.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The paternal allele DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF ( an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstrean enhancers). The enhancers can access Igf2 gene to activate and expresse. <span> </span><span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span><span> gene provides instructions for making <span> insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), a fetal mitogen.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>On  maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, CTCF bind in insulator element, and it means that the enhancers will act on H19. The Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele so we don't see expression.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Wilms' tumor (WT) is an embryonal renal malignancy, which overexpresses </span><span> (IGF-II).</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The lost of imprintin occurs if you have hypermtylation on the maternal allele as well and both aleles, maternal and paternal, have expression of Igf2. In this situation there is a <strong>double dose of IGF-II</strong> in comparisom whith a normal cell. <span>As </span><span>the </span><span>IGF-II </span><span>is </span><span>a promoter of </span><span>growth and increses mitosis  </span><span>leads to the appearance </span><span>of tumors </span><span>as </span><span>Wilm</span><span>'s </span><span>tumor</span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMTs are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a methyl groups to cytosine residues in DNA.

<p><span><strong>-pré-implantation period, early developement</strong>- rapid and active demethylation of paternal genome, passive demethylation of maternal genome;</span></p>
<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable due to the interference whith normal clearing and reseting of epigenetic marcks.</span></p>
