    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells, the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and the intrones within genes are methylated to maintain the integrity of the genome. Additionally the CpG islands (CGIs) are unmethylated. However, the reciprocal is true for cancer cells where the (CGIs) are hypermethylated and there is in general a genome wide hypomethylation. It is also seen in some cancers e.g. colorectal cancer that the CpG shores which inclode2 kb downstream and upstream of the neighboring CGI, are also hypermethylated.</p>
<p>CGIs are generally found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes which decrease the proliferation of the cell as well as allow apoptosis. Therefore methylation of the CGIs will effectively silence the promoter and thus the tumor suppressor gene it promotes. This leads to an increase risk of uncontrolled cell division and thus tumors likewise cancer. The metholation of CGIs are tumor type specific i.e. different tumor types hypermetholates different sets of CGIs</p>
<p>The genome wide hypomethylation decreases the stability of the genome in various ways like the unmethylation of oncogenes. Additionally undermethylation for example allows the strong promoters in the repetitive elements in the genome to be active which leads to unbalanced expression of genes or transcriptional interference.  The unmethylated repetitive elements can also conduct illegitimate reciprocal translocation or copy and pasted themselves (insertions and deletions) in the middle of genes which will have major consequences. This is why in normal healthy non-cancerous cells the repetitive elements are silenced by methylation.</p>
<p>Hypomethylated intergenic regions can also lead to transcription interference as well as illegitimate splicing. This is because there can be cryptic splice sites in the intergenic regions, i.e. splice sites that just happen to code in that loci. In normal healthy cells this would not take place since the splice sites likewise promoters are silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells, Igf2 is expressed on the paternal allele due to its and the maternal alleles methylation status. Basically, both alleles have enhancers that primarily promote the expression of Igf2 upstream. There are two genes upstream from the enhancers namely H19 and Igf2 where H19 is closer to the enhancers and Igf2 is father away. There is also an ICR located between the two genes. In normal cases, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele which allows an insulation capsule (CTCF) to attach to the ICR on the maternal allele. CTCF blocks the enhancers from promoting the expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele but instead promotes the gene located before the capsule i.e. H19. Since there is no insulation capsule to block the enhancers, Igf2 is promoted of the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Imprinting can however be disrupted like in the case of Wilm’s tumour where the maternal allele mimics the paternal allele. In other words, hypermethylation takes place and the maternal allele has the ICR methylated as well as the H19 gene methylated which leads to an increased expression of insulin-like growth factor (Igf2) and decreased expression of H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a FDA approved epigenetic drug that is used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). It is a so called DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which entails that it binds irreversibly to the DNA methyltrasferase upon cell replication (since it is a nucleoside analogue) and inhibits its function.  This leads to the lack of methylation “copy” to the daughter strand. This has an anti-neoplastic effect i.e. it prevents the growth of tumors and is probably effective in MDS patients because MDS is greatly dependent on CGIs hypermethylation. However Decitabine is nonspecific which means that it most likely targets all cells in the body which might have both short and long term consequences on the healthy cells. On the otherhand, tumor cells undergo cell replication much more frequently than healthy cells which means that they will be most affected by the drug.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since epigenetics are mitotically heritable i.e. the epigenetic marks are copied to the daughter cell upon cell replication, medication that alters epigenetic marks can have a consequence or effect for the whole life of a human. Moreover, alteration of epigenetics can have an impact on the actual genome. For example if you alter the epigenetic marks around DNA proofreading and repairing enzymes then those mechanisms might get affected or there is an over/under expression of them. This might result in a genome more prone to mutations which could last a lifetime.         </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs should not be taken by people who are undergoing the first stages of pregnancy. This includes the pre-implantation period (were the zygote forms a blastocysts) and during primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis). These two periods are known to be “sensitive periods” because of the essential remover of epigenetic marks (reprograming) from the genome. Additionally, imprinted marks should be upheld until gametogenesis in order to create a placenta and the repeats in the genome should always be methylated because they are so detrimental. If for example the drugs alter the methylated status of the repeats, then this could be lethal.  </p></div>
