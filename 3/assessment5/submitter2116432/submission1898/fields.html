    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are large clusters of Cystosine and Guanine sequences, typically found near the transcription site of genes, and in a large percentage of promoters.  CGI (CG Islands) are usually hypothmethylated, however if methylation does occur, silencing of the underlying genes results (Hassler &amp; Egger, 2012).  Hypermethylation, and therefore silencing, of tumour suppressor genes is an important consequence of cancer.  Once hpermethylation occurs, transcription may no longer be able to occur for a number of reasons.  This includes direct interference, where the methylation prevents the binding of the transcription factor; transcriptional repressors binding to the methylated DNA; and also alter histone modifications which may result in an inabilty to access the chromatin.  <br /><br />Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are generally methylated, however cancer can cause these regions to become hypomethylated.   This hypomethylation leads to an overexpression of certain genes.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It inhibits DNA methyltransferase, which results in hypomethylation.  This can be useful in reversing the silencing of hypermethylated genes, such as tumour suppressing genes, and aid in the suppression of cancerous tumours.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation is an epigenetic change.  Epigenetic changes are passed down through cell division (which is why cancer cells are so effective). This means that changes that have occurred to cancer cells can be ultimately and permenantly reversed, enabling the destruction of cancer without actually killing the cancer cells.  </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are during DNA replication, and cell division.  Sensitive periods are basically points in the cell cycle where disruption or change, genetically or epigenetically, could result in mutation or mistakes that could lead to future problems or disease in resulting daughter cells.  </p>
<p><br />Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable due to the potential risk of altering the epigenetics of cells that could result in susequent generations with altered methylation that could cause undesirable effects.  </p></div>
