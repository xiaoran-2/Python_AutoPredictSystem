    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the CpG islands are usually not methylated there is just a small subset of CpGs that are dynamically methylated or imprinted methylated. In cancer this scenario is changed and a great amount of CpGs islands are hypermethylated which changes the normal expression profile of some genes like tumor suppressor genes. This disruption give the cancer cells some selective advantage allowing them to grow faster or avoid cellular death. On the other hand there are other genomic regions in normal cells that are constantly methylated such as intergenic regions and repetive elements. In these regions the DNA methylation  maintain the genomic integrity of the cell avoiding  deletions, translocations and insertions. In cancer cells this pattern is changed in a way that the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements became hypomethylated promoting the genomic instability characteristic of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer the parental imprinting is disrupted in the genome and one good example of this phenomenon is the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>In normal cells the paternal allele of this cluster is methylated in the imprinting control region preventing the CTFC binding, the DNA methylation also spreads to the near H19 promoter silencing the expression of this gene. Downstream enhancers  can then access Igf2 and promote its expression instead.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the imprinted control region are normally not methylated so the CTFC protein can bind and the H19 is expressed and enhanced whereas the Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a hypermethylation of this cluster region and both (maternal and paternal) alleles are methylated which double the Igf2 dose in the cell. The Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and increases the cancer cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methyltranferases inhibitor (DNMTi) used to treat cancer. This drug is a nucleoside analogues that incorporates the DNA during replication and irreversibly binds to DNMTs preventing the methylation of the daughter DNA strain. Thus the DNA methylation is reduced and this have a anti-tumor effect in some kind of tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigentic mark that is mitodically inheritable so changes in DNA methylation persists in the cells even after the drug treatment is over. That is why these kind of drugs are potentially important for treatment of cancer and other disorders. Nevertheless it is important to notice that are some sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming where the methylation and other epigenetic markers are settled and resettled in the genome. These periods are manly in the early development of the embryo and during the primordial germ cells development. The use of drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery in these sensitive periods could bring errors in healthy cell types preventing the correct development of the individual cells and tissues.</p></div>
