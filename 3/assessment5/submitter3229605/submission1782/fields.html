    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation generally occurs between genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. On the GpG islands site DNA is not methylated. This phenomenon is very important in terms of imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and the formation of the heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer CpG islands become hypermethylated and that causes the silencing of the downstream gene. This downstream gene can be a tumour suppressing gene.</p>
<p>When tumour suppressing genes are silenced by hypermethylation, cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair are implicated. Genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes are also implied in this manner. Altogether this works in order to promote disease.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA is methylated. We could find CpG dinucleotides of lower densities within coding and non-coding intergenic regions. Intergenic regions have important regulatory functions and contain non-coding RNAs which are crucial in terms of epigenetics as we know. Repetitive elements have functions that are essential to genome performance such as genome replication and accurate transmission to progeny cells and formation of nucleoprotein complexes.</p>
<p>Levels of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can be associated with cancer. On one hand we got DNA hypermethylation and on the other DNA hypomethylation. In both cases either when intergenic regions or repetitive elements are hypo or hypermethylated there are a rupture.</p>
<p>When there is a rupture in the balance between DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements the genes implied are not expressed and that will contribute to cancer. Since these genes are important to control abnormal cell growth and development the disease is free to settle down.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When talking about healthy cells in the paternal allele Igf2 genes are expressed and in the maternal allele H19 genes are expressed. Several sites of upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster imprinting is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour. Igf2 loses imprinting and H19 is hypomethylated. Igf2 takes all the attention and the sites between Igf2 and H19 are methylated.</p>
<p>When this disruption of imprinting takes place there is an increasing in cell growth. This loss of imprinting of Igf2 and reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 is intimately related to Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents, one class of epigenetic inhibitors.</p>
<p>This drug can recapitulate DNA methylation. In DNA hypermethylation sites, Decitabine acts in order to decrease methylation and avoid silencing tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect since it demethylates DNA. It prevents tumour suppressor genes from silencing, so that cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair can occur normally. This event is very important because it promotes the activity of tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division until they are actively erased. When they are erased they do not return.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are also important, they are periods of childhood development that consist in the development of specific areas of the human brain. For example during the learning of language, coordination of muscles and communication.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the final result of the epigenetic treatment could be different from what we wanted initially. We do not know for sure what could really happen and if we could be succeeded, since the brain is not yet totally shaped.</p></div>
