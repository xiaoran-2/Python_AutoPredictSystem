    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p><span> In normal cells most CpG dinucleotides are methylated, exceptions are CpGs in promoters where the level of transcription is inversely proportional to the methylation and CpG islands that are normally not methylated, even when the gene is not active.</span></p>
<p><span>With cancer, the level of methylation at promoter CpG islands is increased which silences the associated gene, often tumor suppressors.  The genotype is termed CIMP.  The "shores" of the CpG islands (areas of about 2kb around the CpG islands) may also be hypermethylated in cancers.  The "shores" are normally methylated in a tissue specific manner so the hypermethylation distorts the expression of the associated genes.</span></p>
<p><span>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements (LINEs, SINEs, satellite repeats) are normally hypermethylated.  This serves to reduce the incidence of the transposons being activated, masks cryptic promoters and inhibits antisense transcription.  This increases the stability of the genome.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer the intergenic and repeated elements are progressively less methylated causing instability in the genome and DNA damage due to transcription of repeat elements.  Demethylation of the repeat elements can lead to crossover errors during mitosis due to the repeats hybridizing.  In addition the transposons can paste themselves into random locations causing instability.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Incorrect imprinting leads to inappropriate expression of the products of the ICR.  The cell acts as if it has two of the same imprint.  This leads to an over expression of some products and a suppression of others.  If the genes over expressed are growth factors or oncogenes or the suppressed are tumor suppressor (or both) then this can be a key step in allowing the growth of cancer. </span></p>
<p><span>In the H19/igf2 cluster the paternal allele normally has the ICR methylated and the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter.  This silences the H19 gene and allows Igf2 to be transcribed due to downstream enhancers. The maternal allele leaves the ICR unmethylated which allows CTCF to bind to it.  CTCF blocks the enhancers from affecting igf2 and with no methylation spread allows H19 to be expressed.</span></p>
<p><span>Wilm's tumor is generally associated with a hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal H19/igf2 ICR which will cause an over expression of igf2 and suppression of H19, that is both imprint regions act like paternal genes.  Igf2 is a growth factor that when over expressed is associated with a number of cancers and H19 can act as a tumor suppressor so the combination contributes to the development of a tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  DNMTs apply methyl groups to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. A DNMTi inhibits the action of DNMTs so its effect is to reduce methylation of DNA.  This can allow it to counter the hypermethylation caused by a tumor.  Hypermethylation in cancers can cause the suppression of various tumor suppressor genes so Decitabine could counter that effect.</span></p>
<p><span>This effect depends on the details of the tumor and which pathways are already inactivated.  In the case of a tumor that is acting primarily by reducing methylation then an agent that further reduces or blocks remethylation would in fact be counter productive.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs can have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because they modify the epigenetic programming. In particular they modify the methylation in the tumor cells and this is durable through mitosis ensuring the cell and child cells maintain it.  In the best case this is sufficient to reduce the tumor but the changes it does make will remain and may then allow other drugs to be more effective.</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the nature of the epigenetic drugs they may have very severe effects during sensitive periods. A sensitive period is one where the cell is making significant changes to the methylation of the DNA (epigenetic reprogramming) and as a result any disruption can lead to improper methylation of the DNA (aberrant imprinting and hypo or hyper methylation in the wrong places).  Early embryonic development and primordial germ cell and germ cell development are both sensitive periods.  In these the cells are removing and then reapplying methyl marks.</span></p>
<p><span>Since during the sensitive period there are many changes to the epigenome the scope for interference is very high.  In the case of Dr Baylin they used an HDACi and azacitidine (a DNMTi) the azacitidine would likely interfere with laying down the correct DNA methylation and the HDACi would interfere with many histone modifications needed during reprogramming.</span></p>
