    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally unmethylated in a healthy cell. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands get hypermethylated. In contrast, normally methylated regions, such us satellite repeats, get globally hypomethylated in disease cells. . In particular, CpG island hypermethylation leads to cancers such as colorectal cancer and is correlated with patient age,<span>gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability and genetic mutation in a particular gene [1]. The repetitive elements hypomethylation contributes to aberrant expression and general genomic instability.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, which means it combats hypermethylation in cells, demethylating sites that are normally unmethylated. For example, the drug could remove CpG island hypermethylation, especially in tumour suppressor genes, where hypermethylation means that the cell can't control its replication. When Decitabine demethylates such a region, it frees up the gene to express its function, which is tumour supression. Decitabine is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, which essentially are caused by uncontrolled growth, or inadequate tumour suppression.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually, methylation is passed from an ancestral cell to its duplicants through mitosis. If this cell were to grow to become part of a tumour through replication, the treatment of the cell altering its DNA methylation means  it will pass that 'treatment' to its progenies, the cells that would form the tumour. This means a long-term effect of such a therapy. However, during the sensitive periods of development, in which methylation in the genome gets globally reprogrammed (unmethylates completely and methylates again, undergoing an epigenetic 'reboot' of sorts), treating with drugs that affect the epigenome is potentially dangerous. There are two sensitive periods, the primordial germ cell development and the early development of the embryo. Alterating the epigenome in those cases (such as pregnant women during those phases), would have a huge effect on the embryo's epigenome, perhaps rendering it unviable, and in germ cells, which could render the human permanently infertile.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, H19 is unmethylated, which renders Igf2 inactive. In contrast, in the paternal allele H19 is methylated/inactive, which leads to enhancers that enable the Igf expression. Disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 leads to overexpression of Igf2 (expression from both alleles behaving as paternal alleles), and too little expression of Cdkn1c (which is tumour suppressing). This in effect leads to aberrant tissue development, such as tumour overgrowth.</p>
