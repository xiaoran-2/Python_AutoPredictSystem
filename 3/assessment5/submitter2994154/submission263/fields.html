    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of CpG islands normaly leads to silencing of gene expression and most of the times CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer there is a locus specific hypermethylation of CpG Islands. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor supressor genes leads to their silencing which can be one hit of the multiple hits to the DNA according to the Knudson hypothesis. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions probably plays a role in maintaining genomic integrity and prevention of formation of abnormal karyoptypes. Methylation of repetive elements also ensures genomic integrity through prevention transposition, illegitimate recombination and the silencing of repeats avoids transcriptional interferene from strong promotors. In cancer we see hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic regions. This leads to illegimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposons and activation of cryptic promotors </p>
<p><br />Overall we see a genome wide hypomethylation in cancer which leads to genomic instability and we see locus specific hypermethylations of tumor supressor genes which leads to their loss of function. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated which blocks the binding of CTCF (which isolates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promotor silence it and the down stream enhancers can activate Igf2 expression. In summary H19 is inactive and Igf2 is active. The ICR of the maternal allel is unmethylated. Therfore the promotor of H19 is not silenced and H19 is expressed. CTCF can bind and thus isolate Igf2 from downstream enhancers inhibitin it's expression. In summary H19 is active and igf2 is silenced.<br />In Wilm's tumor the maternal allel looks like the paternal allel. Both ICRs are methylated so Igf2 is overexpressed since CTCF is not binding to the maternal ICR. The hypermethlation of the ICR thefore leads to a loss of imprinting.<br />Igf2 is a oncogen that promotes growth. Overexpression of Igf2 leads to abberant growth of cells.</p>
<p>Since many imprinted genes are associated with growth control the loss of imprinting is an important feature in cancer development</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a a DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor)<br />Through inhbition of DNMTs, Decitabine leads to hypomethylation of the DNA. DNMTi are incorporated into the DNA and therfore it must be accesible, like durring replication. Tumor cells rapidly replicate so theese cells will be hit the hardest although other dividing cells will be affected as well. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplatsic syndrom, a malignancie that is caused by hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes. So the sofar discovered anti-tumor effect is the reversal of hypermethylation and therefore reactivation of tumor supressor genes. </p>
<p>Decitabine can be used as a cancer treatment through its reversal of hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In somatic cells epigenetic marks are maintained and no reprograming occurs. If a drug epigentically alters DNA methylation this alteration is passed on to the daughter cells and maintained. In a senistive period epigenetic reprogramming instead of maintaining occurs. Senistive periods of development occure during embryogenesis and germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating for example a pregnant mother would not only affect her but also her child and her grandchild. If the mother would receive a DNMTi the normal establishing of epigenetic marks of the paternal and maternal genome during embryogenesis would not be possible. </p>
<p>Treating a young adult is also inadvisible since imprinted genes are reprogrammed during germ cell maturation and interfering with DNA methylation would interfere with epigenetic imprinting. Consequences of aberrant imprinting are highlighted by known imprinting disorders like the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrom or the Angelman Syndrom. </p></div>
