    <div class="field-value"><h1>Question 1</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation is pervasive healthy human cells; it regulates gene expression and maintains chromosomal stability; it is essential for maintaining the predetermined, correct pattern of gene expression in different cell types (e.g. long-lived neurons versus constantly replaced skin cells).</p>
<p>It is now common knowledge among researchers that DNA methylation is associated with cancer. When DNA methylation occurs, the DNMTs (DMNT1, DMNT3A and DMNT3B) add a methyl group to a C (cytosine nucleotide) that is followed by a G (guanine nucleotide). This combination of a C followed by a G is called CpG, and regions of the DNA sequence where there is a high concentration of CpG motifs are called CpG islands.</p>
<p>In a normal cell CpG islands are likely to be hypomethylated whereas introns and intergenic regions are methylated, and at the same time a genome-wide methylation of repetitive elements is observed. In contrast, in a cancer cell, CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated whereas introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In about 60% of the genes that code for proteins, the promoters lie within CpG islands. When these genes are active, the levels of methylation of the CpG islands are low. The CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated when the genes are switched off. Now, if the genes so silenced are tumour suppressor genes for example, then the consequence can be uncontrolled cell growth which eventually leads to cancer.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, as is observed in cancer cells, leads to genome instability, which manifests itself in illegitimate reconstructions between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. As a consequence there ensue indels and reciprocal translocations, which belong to the classic abnormalities associated with cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h1>Question 2</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Methylation of ICRs has different effects depending on the mode of action of ICR, which itself varies with each cluster.</p>
<p>Let us take the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted genes, located on human chromosome 11. On the paternal allele DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF, an insulator protein. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it. Downstream enhancers can now access Igf2 to promote its expression; we end up with an imprinted expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and ICR can bind CTCF, so Igf2 is shielded from downstream enhancers, which now act directly on H19 to enhance its expression.</p>
<p>Expression disruption in H19/Igf2 and in Kncq1, two closely linked clusters, can lead to a disorder known as the Bechwith Wiedemann syndrome. Specifically, disruption to Cdkn1c ( a tumour suppressor) and to Igf2 ( an oncogene) leads to two paternal like alleles. The result is an overdose of Igf2 and no expression of Cdkn1c, i.e. overall growth promoting. This is a predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours, the most common of which is found in the kidney and known as Wilm’s tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h1>Question 3</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine belongs to a class of medications called DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitors.<strong> </strong>As mentioned earlier, DNA methylation happens when DNMTs add a methyl group to cytosine nucleotide. Decitabine binds DNMTs irreversibly after it has been incorporated in the DNA and  so prevents the maintenance of the hypermethylated state of the CpG islands, which ultimately leads to hypomethylation. As a consequence, genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed upon treatment with the DNMT inhibitor.<strong></strong></p>
<p>It is thought that the re-expression of genes involved in normal cell cycle control, differentiation and apoptotic pathways makes up the anti-tumour effect of Decitabine and similar epigenetic drugs.</p>
<p>Decitabine is FDA approved and is currently used worldwide with considerable success for the treatment of a group of bone marrow disorders commonly known as MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrom). However the treatment results on solid tumours has been less spectacular so far.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h1>Question 4</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs like Decitabine are currently being used to treat blood cancers with considerable success. Whilst drugs have easier access to blood than to other organs, solid tumours have proven a tougher target, because drugs have first to penetrate them to act. But recently, there has been reported that a combination of Azacitidine and Decitabine “have altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy”.</p>
<p>The idea that drugs that alter DNA methylation could have a long-lasting effect beyond treatment discontinuation rests on the fact that once actively erased epigenetic changes do not return.</p>
<p>Sensitve periods are those when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. On edistinguishes essentially two sensitive periods of development, namely the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms, and the pre-impplantation and the early post-implantation period. These are the periods of active remodeling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>Epigenetic treatments which actively interfere with the epigenome during sensitive periods can have deleterious effects similar to the flaws observed in assertive reproductive technology or IVF (non-viable foetus, foetus abnormalities, disorders in infants).</p></div>
