    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1.DNA methylation occurs at the cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA, as it regulates gene transcription.  Alterations of DNA methylation is particularly common in a variety of tumors. In order to suppress oncogenes and other tumor genes, there must be alterations in the CpG island methylation pattern, along with some histone regulation and dysregulation of DNA binding proteins. CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites, the p- which stands for phosphodiester bonds.  During normal CpG methylation the cells are often inverted which eventually become tumorigenic, preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, whereas other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated.  In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often  hypermethylated, we then observe CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences becoming decreased.  It is then observed that CpG island methylation is duely important in the regulation process of gene expression, although cytosine methylation can lead directly to destabilsing genetic mutations and a precancerous cellular state. </p>
<p>During repeated rounds of stem-cell mobilisation and replication which accompany ageing of cells DNA methyltransferases are recruited to the borders of some CpG islands depositing methyl groups and creating methylation pressure for these particular islands.  The balance of methylation pressure and methylation protection is disrupted in the CpG island methylator phenotype which then results in the spread of methylation into the transcription start area triggering the silencing cascade effect.  When there are defects in DNA methylation it can be closely associated with cancer and other diseases, this is because of the reduction of DNA methylstion and heavily methylated repeat elements.  Irregular functioning of these sites tend to produce genomic instability and oncogene activation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IGF2 gene is responsible for providing the instructions for making a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 and this protein plays an active role growth and development before birth under normal methylation processes. People tend to inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one from the father with both copies typically active whereby it is turned on in cells.  With the IGF2 gene the copy that is inherited from a person's father is the only active copy in most parts of the body.  This parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by genomic imprinting.</p>
<p>IGF2 is part of a cluster of genes on the short p arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imoprinting. Another gene present in this cluster is H19 also active in growth. Loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene has been identifiedx in several types of cancers known as embryonal tumors, these tumors include a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor.  This is a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma and a form of liver cancer known as hepatoblastoma.  These tumors are common in people with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, there is a loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene is also present with Wilms tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of highly synergestic and unique gene expression and epigenetic profiles of DLBCL, which is also the deacetylase inhibitors another group of epigenetic modyfying agents.  Decitabine is now being utilised to treat patients with acute myeloid leukemia which is charaacterised by dysregulated gene expression and abnormal patterns of DNA methylation. Decitabine exhibits antitumoral properties in ardenocortical carcinoma cells at clinically achievable doses and may be an effective adjuvant therapy in patients with advancecd disease.  This inhibitor also recover expression of silenced genes on 11q13, which suggest that it can act in the role of epigenetic gene silencing in adrenocortical carcinogenesis.  It in turn inhibits cell invasion thus preventing further cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methyl group functions to attach the DNA within each cell to selective genes necessary for the particular cell's proteins. Some of the methyl groups attached to DNA can cause changes to cascade of cells due to change in diet or exposure to certain chemicals. Changes to DNA methyl groups can have epigenetic changes to the genome and also affect inheritance patterns. DNA methylation is involved in processes such as aging and gene regulation altered patterns of methylaton have been associated with disease formation.   It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. These changes can result in gene expression changes and probably loss of function.  During sensitive periods patients may not react fully to the drugs used to treat them as there is a high level of the chemical causing negative changes to normal gene expression and function.  The drugs may not be able to inhibit these receptors and may then cause dysfunction to normal functioning gene receptors.</p></div>
