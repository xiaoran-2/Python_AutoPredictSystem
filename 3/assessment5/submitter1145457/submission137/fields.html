    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer derives as much from alterations to the epigenome as it does from genetic mutations. One of the primary ways cellular processes go awry in tumours is by disruptions of normal DNA methylation. DNA methylation at CpG islands found in or near the promoters of many genes serves to switch off the expression of these genes. Tumour cells usually display an increase in methylation of these CpG islands as a result of processes such as amplification or mutation of DNA methyltransferases. This increase in CpG island methylation can contribute to disease by switching off the expression of tumour suppressor genes that prevent excessive cell proliferation. In contrast, normal cells usually display high levels of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This ensures genomic stability by preventing unwanted recombination between similar sites on different chromosomes or the activity of strong promoters in repetitive elements on nearby genes. In cancer these protective methylation marks are lost, which brings about illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and consequent transposition and the activation strong intra-repeat promoters. This genomic instability can then bring about the activation of oncogenes and the suppression of tumour suppressor genes and the further promotion of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The process of hypermethylating imprint control regions (ICRs) can often contribute to cancer. An example of this is the imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the paternal allele is imprinted and therefore methylated at the ICR. This prevents the binding of CTCF which normally acts as an insulator. With no insulator the present, the nearby enhancers cause the expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele. The ICR of the maternal allele lacks methylation and it is able to bind the insulator CTCF. This blocks the activity of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene which ends up not being expressed. In Wilm's tumour the maternal ICR in this cluster is also methylated, leading to an expression of Igf2, just as on the paternal allele. Because Igf2 promotes cell growth, the double dose of this gene as a consequence of disruption of imprinting can contribute to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved cancer drug that acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. This class of drugs are nucleoside analogues and are able to block the activity of DNA methyltransferases by irreversibly binding to the enzymes, following incorporation into DNA strands. The outcome of this is the overall reduction in DNA methylation throughout the cell, with optimal reduction occurring at sub-maximal drug doses. The hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressor genes is highly prevalent in cancer and this serves to inactivate these cellular protection mechanisms. By reducing overall DNA methylation, Decitabine can restore the activity of these suppressed tumour suppressor genes and help combat the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The property of drugs that target the epigenetic machinery to have a lasting effect on tumour cells is a consequence of the fact that epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation that is laid down or removed during the drug treatment period is maintained by maintenance DNA methyltransferases operating in daughter cells. These drugs would be harmful if used during certain sensitive periods of development, which involve active remodelling of the epigenome. The two primary sensitive periods in development are primordial germ cell development up to production of mature gametes and the pre-implantation and early post-implantation development period. Treating patients during these periods e.g. a pregnant woman, would have a large, almost certainly deleterious, impact on the patient's offspring. Epigenetic reprogramming is a very precise process and an active environmental assault at this in the form of a drug molecule would impact all cellular processes dependent on epigenetics.</p></div>
