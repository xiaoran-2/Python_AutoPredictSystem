    <div class="field-value"><p>Most CpG islands lie in the promoters of genes. In the normal tissues those CG islands tend to be unmethylated - independently of the activity state of the gene. When the DNA of those CpG islands is heavily methylated the gene controlled by that promoter is switched off (some genes can be switched off by other repressive epigenetics marks even if the CpG islands on their promoters are hypomethylated; and other promoters may not have CpG islands at all).</p>
<p>In cancer cells there are many CpG islands that are hypermethylated. If the CpG islands in the promoters of  tumour suppressor genes are hypermethylated those tumour suppressor genes will be inactivated.</p>
<p>In normal cells intragenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypermethylated- and so inactive. Repetitive elements like retrotransposons -  if switched on - can duplicate themselves and jump from one place to another place in the genome disrupting it; in addition they usually have very strong and bidirectional promoters that can act on genes lying both upstream and downstream of them altering their normal functioning. In cancer those regions become progressively more hypomethylated allowing for genetic defects (illegitimate transpositions, duplications, deletions, creation of  "de novo fusion genes"...) and malfunctioning of many genes.</p>
<p>These changes in methylation are some of the multiple "hits" necessary to make a cell cancerous (instead of inducing its apoptosis when something goes amiss). And these hits induce other hits leading to a chain reaction of events.</p>
<p>I guess that in the same way that this dysregulation in methylation can alter the fine tuning between "necessary and too much growth", it can also change the fine tuning between necessary "defensive" inflammation and too much or inappropriate inflammation playing a role in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth promotion and restriction (reflecting the conflict of interest between both parents regarding the growing of their offspring). Loss of imprinting is an early event in cancer (it may happen in precancerous cells) because it disrupts the highly tuned equilibrium between oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoter and it's imprinted.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and attracts an insulator protein and they make "a shield" that prevents the enhancers activating Igf2 (they activate H19 instead). The paternal ICR  is hypermethylated permitting activation of Igf2. This hypermethylation extends to H19 ( heterochromatin spreading). As a result of all this the maternal allele expreses H19 but not Igf2 and the paternal allele expreses only Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the maternal allele is hypermethylated behaving like the paternal allele and so Igf2 is upregulated allowing for pathological growth.</p>
<p>If the paternal ICR is unmethylated Igf2 won't be expressed at all. If both ICR are hypermethylated Igf2 will be overexpressed. In Beckwith-Wiedeman both copies of the related clusters Kcnq1 and Igf2/H19  behave like the paternal copy: upregulation of Igf2 and no expression of Cdkn1q (tumour suppressor) leading to overgrowth and predisposition to embryo/chilhood tumours</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor and a nucleoside analog.</p>
<p>When DNA replicates nucleoside analogs can be taken up by DNA replaicing a nucleoside. When DNMT comes to methylate the unmethylated daughter DNA strand and finds Decitabine - instead of the normal cytidine- it binds to Decitabine that cannot get methylated and gets stuck to it. After that the enzyme is taken to another part of the cell and broken down. So the level of DNA methylation keeps on falling on sucessive cell divisions owing both to the interference of Decitabine upon DNA methylation and to the falling levels of DNMT (produced by its breaking down after it gets stuck on Decitabine)</p>
<p>When a cancer is very dependent on the hypermethylation of the CpG islands on the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, and their subsequent inactivation, lowering the levels of methylation, may make those genes again more active (by demethylating them).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic change and so by definition mitotically heritable. So, if we induce an epigenetic change on a cell, that cell will pass that change on its progeny. In the case of cancer, if that epigenetic change happens by chance to make the cancerous cells more susceptible to conventional chemotherapy, the effect may last even after the "epigenetic drug" has been stopped because the "epigenetically modified daughter cancer cells" will retain that property.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those when (generalised) epigenetic reprogramming occurs: early embryonic and primordial germ cells developments (most likely there are also small windows for particular organs during later fetal development). Although the germ line is established in the fetus, oocytes don't mature until puberty and spermatogenesis is life lasting in males.</p>
<p>The "epigenetic drugs" aren't selective and can affect many different cells. If you give those drugs in a sensitive period the whole epigenome of a future child can be affected (or even a grandchild in case of a pregnant woman). Even if we forget about future generations it is disturbing to think about the potential consequences of an important change of the epigenome when the patient has a long life ahead.</p></div>
