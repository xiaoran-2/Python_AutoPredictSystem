    <div class="field-value"><p>The change made by DNA methylation is usually permanent and unidirectional. In adult somatic cells, Dna methylation usually takes place in regions called CpG islands, but in embryonic stem cells such methylation can take place in other places as oppsed to the specific methylation in CpG islands.CpG islands can be found in about two- third of the promoter regions. Usially these regions remain unmethylated so in normal cases this undermethylation leads to the activity of the promoter sequence so the gene related to this promoter can normally be transcribed.</p>
<p>  In the case of cancer, these CpG islands in the promoter sequences are hypermethylated. This hypermethylation in turn causes the promoter to be inactive and the gene to be silenced. for example the silencing of the tumor supressor gene can lead to the formation of a cancer. But sometimes hypomethylation in CpG islands can lead to the over expression of oncogenes and also lead to cancer formation. </p>
<p>  In the disease we consider the hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation  results in the silencing of the gene.DNA methylation is inheritable and it can be considered one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.The methylation in CGIs increases with time. The resulting clone of cells (with two hits) from this mutated cell will grow faster and lead to the tumor. </p>
<p> In a normal cell,there is methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genetic stability.</p>
<p> In a cancer cell, these regions are hypomethylated leading to instability of the genome. Thus leading to illegitimate recombination between repeats because the repeats can allign and are not densely packed. Also activation of repeats and transposition can take place, and activation of cryptic promoters. This leads to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This gene cluster is paternally imprinted because the imprint control region on the paternal chromosome is methylated. This in causes the enhances to increase the expression of Igf2 and the Igf2 increases in quantity.  </p>
<p>Maternal ICR is unmethylated and it is covered by CTCF which inhibits the expression of Igf2. but as Igf2 decreases, the H19 expression id enhanced by downstream enhances. </p>
<p>Overexpression of Igf2 is correlated with the development of the Wilm's tumor. Although Igf2 is normally only expressed from the paternal allele, there is Loss of imprinting and leads to the biallelic expression of the gene. A <span style="font-size:14px;">transcript that is antisense to IGF2,(IGF2-AS), is transcribed from within IGF2 in a reverse orientation. This transcript is also </span><span style="font-size:14px;">maternally imprinted and overexpressed in Wilms’ tumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hypermethylation and hypomethylation at the H19/Igf2  imprinting control region result in reciprocal changes in H19/Igf2 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver–Russell syndrome. <span> BWS is also caused by the loss of ICR methylation and disregulation in the centromere cluster or paternal uniparental disomy, which results in aberrant methylation at the ICRs of both clusters. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. </span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It causes a global hypomethylation of DNA.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. It <span>is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA, causing cell death.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are permanent and can be passed down to daughter cells. So if DNA methylation is induced by an epigenetic drug then this change is passed down to the daughter cells and will give an enduring effect. A small dose of the drug can cause a long lasting effect. So you can stop a cancer without having to wipe out all the cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods ar periods where the environment can affect the genetic make up of the cell.</p>
<p>From primordial germ cells to the developed egg or sperm can be considered as one sensitive period. The second sensitive period is the pre-implantation period and the early post-implantation period. Both of these periods involve active remodelling of the genome. Here there is removal and laying down of epigenetic marks of genome.</p>
<p>During the sensitive period if the genes were exposed to the drug of treatment, then the genomic remodelling would be influenced by the drug and this remodelling would be a global remodelling and hence an undesired effect will result. Many mutations would result and be passed down to daughter cells and mayeb lead to further diseases.</p></div>
