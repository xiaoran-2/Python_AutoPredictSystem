    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands are found in the promotors of genes and are unmethylated (hypomethylated) This allows for the binding of transcription factors so that transcription of the gene occurs and the gene is expressed. Indeed most CpG islands are unmethylated whether the gene is expressed or not. Occasionally the CpG islands found in a gene promotor are methylated. This means that transcription factors cannot bind and the gene is silenced, constituting an epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>In cancer however, the CpG islands show increased DNA methylation (hypermethylation), which often increases with the stage of the disease. The methylation of individual CpG islands also varies with the tumour line. Hypermethylation of the CpG islands in cancer results in the abnormal epigenetic silencing of the underlying gene. In cancer these are usually tumour supressor genes. If both alleles are silenced there will be no tumour growth supression, which allows the cancerous cells to multiply, and gives them a competitive advantage over the surrounding  normal cells.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements promotes genome stability, preventing illegitimate recombinations, deletions and duplication. It does this by causing the heterochromatinisation of these regions, which also prevents repetitive elements from transposing elsewhere in the genome potentially disrupting coding genes or activating neighbouring genes with their strong promotors. In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated causing the heterochromatin to become euchromatin. This opens up the chromatin so that repetitive elements can recombine with similar repetitive elements elsewhere in the genome causing illegitmate recombination with non-autologous chromosomes, deletions or duplications, potentially resulting in abberent gene expression. They can also transpose or multiply throughout the genome causing transcriptional abberation in the surrounding regions, either by interrupting coding genes or activating silent genes with their cryptic promotors. Abberent expression of oncogenes may occur in this way.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting disruption by hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions often happens in cancer. Normally in the H19/IgF2 cluster the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) blocking CTCF (an insulator protein) from binding to it. CTCF bound to ICR also insulates the IgF2 gene, but in the paternal allele transcription enhancers are free to enchance the expression of the preferred gene, IgF2 (and not H19). Conversely, the maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR which CTCF can bind to, which insulates the IgF2 gene from transcription. Consequently, in the matenal allele IgF2 is not expressed but H19 is, as the enhancers act upon  H19 when IgF2 is unavailable.</p>
<p>Imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumor, where the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated (hypermethylated) and so behaves like the paternal allele i.e. expresses IgF2 and not H19 because the ICR cannot bind CTCF. This means that these cells express a double dose of IgF2  (and no H19). IgF2 is a growth promoting gene (many imprinted genes are involved in growth regulation). Thus these cells will receive a selective advantage over the surrounding normal cells and grow more rapidly, contributing to the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) acting upon DNMT as it replicates methylation to daughter DNA strands. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into DNA during replication. During cell division DNMT normally attaches to the methylated nucleoside to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, but here it binds irreversibly to Decitabine and cannot. Consequently, methylation is progressively washed out during division. Cancer cells divide more rapidly than most normal cells, so Decitabine acts preferentially on them without killing the surrounding cells. Hypermethylation of CpG islands is found in many cancers causing inactivation of tumour supressor genes, possibly why Decitabine is so effective in AML where hypermethylation of CpG islands is linked to poor outcome. CpG island shores are also affected. Epigenetic marks are stably heritable, so tumour daughter cells should remain demethylated and anti-tumor genes able to supress growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation constitutes a critical part of the epigenome. It  is an extremely stable epigenetic mark, stably heritable throughout the cell division of cell lines, thus any alteration to DNA methylation with epigenetic drugs will be inherited by the daughter cells of those originally treated, probably enduring for the lifetime of the patient. In the case of cancer we hope that abnormal methylation would be reverted to its normal state by epigenetic drugs. However, epigenetic drugs may act upon all cells, altering the DNA methylation of normal cells in an undesirable way. This is especially important in the so-called sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming when DNA methylation is removed and laid down in a cell line specific way, and is especially susceptible to environmental signals. The sensitive periods comprise gametogenesis (germ cell development) and pre-implantation development after fertilization, and are potentially the most at risk from epigenetic drugs. Therefore it is inadvisable to treat pregnant women (where the fetus is at preimplantation stage undergoing epigenetic reprogramming, or mid-gestation where it is undergoing primordial germ cell development) or children during the years when the germ cells are developing, which would affect the epigenome of their children.</p></div>
