    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually protected from methylation therefore, in a normal cell you will see an unmethylated CpG island. In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. Methylation of a CpG island is associated with silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. A cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes epigenetically by locking in a silent inactive state. DNA methylation, and consequent epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes, can be one of the multiple hits, (Knudson hypothesis – cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA), required for cancer to occur.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Over time the cells, which have this epimutation, are likely to divide more rapidly or to live longer and they will therefore take over, this is how we think cancers eventuate.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity, it is also associated with some silencing of expression of cryptic promoters (activity leading out the other direction), or cryptic splice sites. Cells which do not contain DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1), exhibit genomic instability. There are likely to be more deletions, reciprocal translocations, duplications and insertions.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also required to maintain genomic integrity and stability. The normal methylated state does not allow the open chromatin structure required for repeats to align. The compacted structure ensures the silencing of repeats, to prevent mutagenic transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and it helps prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer there are global changes in DNA methylation , this is a hallmark of cancer. The intergenic regions and their repetitive elements are now unmethylated. This DNA hypomethylation at the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements leads to genomic instability in the instances of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated. When this ICR is unmethylated it is bound by a protein called CTCF, this insulates Igf2 from the enhancers which are now free to act on H19. The preferred loop is between the enhancers and IGF2, but when CTCF blocks this the second preference is to enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated. Therefore it is paternally imprinted. When the ICR is methylated CTCF can no longer bind, Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, when it becomes methylated it is silenced. This means the enhancers are free to act on Igf2. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. Igf2 promotes growth, it is an oncogene. </p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome, due to imprinted disorders, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, there is too much Igf2 and no Cdkn1c expression, (growth promotion but no growth inhibition). One of the phenotypes of Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome is a predisposition to embryonic/childhood, (but not adult) tumours, in particular Wilm’s tumour, which is found in the kidney.</p>
<p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth, loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia – AML. Decitabine is in a class of medications called hypomethylation agents.</p>
<p>DNA methylation and consequent epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is found in every type of cancer, which has been studied. Decitabine promotes hypomethylation at these CpG islands, this means that the tumour suppressor genes are expressed rather than silenced.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNA methyltransferase is bound and can no longer be released. The action is division dependent, the cell must be replicating. Cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly will be more severely affected.</p>
<p>When Decitabine is used at low doses it is acting on on the DNA methylation and has very good anti-neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>There are two periods of epigenetic reprogramming which are sensitive to any external influences which may disrupt the processes.</p>
<p>During the pre-implantation and post implantation period in early development, there is a resetting of epigenetics marks. The correct level of maternal effect proteins, which protect the imprint control regions from rapid clearing of DNA methylation, is required.</p>
<p>During primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm. Imprinted genes need to be reprogrammed at germ cell development, and then need to maintain their level of DNA methylation in imprinted clusters, so they are set up in the parental origin specific way.</p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods is inadvisable, because drug induced changes in DNA methylation, whilst having a beneficial effect on the cancer, may also disrupt the normal epigenetic reprogramming. In younger patients this would affect the primordial germ cell and germ cell development and would potentially be passed on to successive generations.</p>
