    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found hypomethylated in a normal cell, whereas in a cancer cells the CpG islands are founf hypermethylated; DNA methylation is bound to have a normal function if intergenic regions, repetitive elements and genes, where these reagions are found methylated.  DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer, because tumour suppressors are found hypermethylated, causing a silencing effect of the tumour suppressor genes, which eventually cause the proliferation of cancerous tumours.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in a normal cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of DNA are usually hypermethylated. If these regions are to be hypomethylated, it will cause genomic instability (illegitimate recombination between repeats, activations of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes.) Genomic or chromosomal instability causes DNA mutation, which eventually causes cancer or any given disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation at ICR’s (hypo or hypermethylated), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes.  In DNA, the paternal allele of H19/Igf2 is usually found methylated while the H19 promoter in the maternal allele is found unmethylated.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour because both H19 promoters are methylated in both alleles (maternal and paternal), causing a disruption in the CTCF inhibition of Igf2, resulting in an overexpression of Igf2 in Wilm’s tumour. The disruption of imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster causes an evident overexpression of Igf2, promoting a disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used for treatment of myelodysplatic syndromes, this drug is considered a hypomethylating agent, were its main function is to inhibit DNA methyltransferase.  DNA methylation changes during time, but whereas a tumour suppressor is found hypermethylated, it’s function lacks, so a CpG- Island is bound to be hypermethylated, causing the tumour to spread. Decitabine’s role is to reduce epigenetic hypermethylation in the CpG-Islands, lowering the risk of tumour spreading. Decitabine is often prescribed in low dosages, to cause a hypomethylation of DNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Treating people with an epigenetic drug, may altered the tumour cells by in some way by activating more than usual the tumour suppressors found in DNA, this will eventually make any kind of tumour more susceptible to chemotherapy. Whereas not only are the tumours being treated with chemotherapy, most of them won’t be able to spread because of the over stimulated tumour suppressors. Take into consideration that these tumour suppressors won’t shut down there over stimulated function after being done with the drug treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period is considered when an environmental alteration could cause an effect in the epigenetic control, usually when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These sensitive periods are during early development (pre-implantation) in utero and during primordial germ cell development; males (ages: 9-12), females (ages: 8-10).</p>
<p>Treating patients with an epigenetic drug during a sensitive period would be inadvisable, because the changes caused to the epigenome may have a transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, were future generations of this patients may be affected.  </p></div>
