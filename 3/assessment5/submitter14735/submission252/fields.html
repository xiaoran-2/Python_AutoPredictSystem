    <h1>Submission 252 from Anon (session_user_id: fc72ce6c6ad6fc60f2376c5ebb71a54e679885d4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, a disease where some types of blood cells don't work.  Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, so the drug causes the hypomethylation of DNA.  The drug makes it harder to methylate control regions for tumor suppressing genes; thus, tumor suppressing genes will remain expressed.  If the tumor suppressing genes are on, then tumors will be less able to grow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation alters gene expression.  The fact that the methylation bond is a covalent bond implies that the bond will remain broken or will remain present after drug treatment ceases.  Changes to DNA methylation are passed on to daughter cells during cell division.  Thus, drugs that alter DNA methylation will have effects that last longer than the drug treatment.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development where the epigenome is susceptible to environmental signals such as overeating, smoking, and the presence of toxins.  Examples of sensitive periods include the prenatal period and the first two years or so of life.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because this is when many important epigenetic signals are being established, such as DNA methylation.  Altering the epigenome at this stage could disrupt the natural epigenome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found in promotors and they are normally kept clear of methylation for expressed genes.  CpG islands in cancer become more densely methylated.  This has the effect of silencing genes that would normally suppress cancer such as tumor suppressor genes.  BRCA1 in breast cancer can be hypermethylated.</p>
<p>Normally DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintains genome stability.  DNA methylation in intergenic regions inhibits expression of repeats, inhibits illegitimate recombination between repeats, and inhibits activation of cryptic promotors.  During cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements becomes less densely methylated.  This contributes to disease by causing insertions, reciprocal translocations, and deletions.  In general, there is genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations in DNA methylation (hypomethylation or hypermethylation) at imprint control regions (ICR) can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.  Normally, the imprint control region for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal allele but not on the maternal allele.  Because of this, enhancers will act on H19 in the maternal allele while Igf2 is silent because CTCF binds to the ICR.  On the paternal allele, enhancers act on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed, while H19 is not expressed.  In Wilm's tumor, both the  maternal and paternal ICR for the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, and this causes double expression of Igf2, a growth promoting gene.  Increased expression of growth promoting genes contributes to tumor genesis.</p></div>
