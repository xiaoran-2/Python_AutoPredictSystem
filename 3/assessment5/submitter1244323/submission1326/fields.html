    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">1.1 CpG islands (CGIs) are clusters of C-G nucleotide pairs generally found at promoters at the start of genes. When the CGI at a gene promoter is unmethylated that particular gene is often expressed. All cells contain a full copy of the genome. In somatic cells the genes required for the particular cell type are expressed the others (~70-80% of the total) are silenced by CGI hypermethylation. CGIs at the active gene sites in normal cells are protected from DNA methylation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1.2 In a cancer, it is particularly common to find methylated CGIs (hypermethylation) at the promoters associated with tumor suppression genes which would normally be unmethylated, i.e. actively expressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1.3 DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so when the CGI at a tumor suppression gene becomes hypermethylated the resultant gene silencing is passed on to the daughter cell. If the gene is silenced on both alleles carrying the gene tumor suppression will not occur leading to tumor growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1.4 In normal somatic cells C-G nucleotide pairs (CpGs) occurring in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to prevent interference with desired gene expression and/or a repetitive element making a copy of itself and transposing into another part of the genome which leads to genetic instability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1.5 In cancer CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements become progressively unmethylated (i.e. there is genome-wide hypomethylation) which leads to the interference and genetic instability mentioned in 1.4.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1.6 Hypomethylation of the CpGs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to illegal recombination between repeats across different chromosomes. It can also lead to disruption of gene expression when a transposon interferes with the coding region of a gene or it activated a neighboring gene.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">2.1 Methylation of the paternal ICR  prevents the protein CTCF from binding to it. Without this protein in place the DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter and silences it. When the promoter for the lncRNA H19 is silenced, downstream enhancers instead act on the IGF2 gene to cause its expression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2.2 On the maternal allele the H19/IGF2 ICR is unmethylated so CTCF binds to the ICR thus preventing the spreading of DNA methylation to the H19 promoter. In its unmethylated state the downstream enhancers are attracted to the H19 promoter rather than the IGF2 gene. Without the enhancers the IGF2 gene on the maternal allele is not expressed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2.3 Overexpression of IGF2 is found in patients (usually children) suffering from Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer. The overexpression is caused by DNA methylation of the H19/IGF2 ICR on the maternal allele which then spreads to the H19 promoter—i.e. the unmethylated maternal imprint is lost. The maternal allele consequently begins to express IGF2 since the downstream enhancers are no longer attracted to H19.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2.4 Expression of IGF2 from both alleles in a cell can lead to abnormal (i.e. cancerous) growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">3.1 Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). DNMTis are nucleoside analogs that get incorporated in the DNA and prevent DNMT1 from binding to the hemi-methylated DNA and thus prevent DNA methylation being copied to the daughter strand during replication.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3.2 By inhibiting the copying of DNA methylation to the daughter strand, a DNMTi reduces the tumor suppression gene silencing caused by the hypermethylation of the CGI at its promoter, a common phenotype in cancer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3.3 One of the hallmarks of cancer is hypermethylation of CGIs found in the promoters at tumor suppressor genes. If the DNMTi is incorporated into the DNA at that site the methylation would not be copied to the daughter strand. If the methylation is not copied to the daughter strand during cell replication, the tumor suppressor gene could be expressed the re-enabling tumor suppression mechanisms.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.1 DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable epigenetic mark. Thus changes to DNA methylation are carried forward into new cells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.2 A sensitive period indicates a time during development when DNA methylation is removed and laid down <em>de novo—</em>the cell is reprogrammed.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.3 There are two sensitive periods during prenatal development.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Pre-implantation development</strong>. During this time methylation is removed except at imprinted genes and repeated elements (IAPs). At this point cells are totipotent i.e. able to be differentiated into any cell type. DNA methylation is then laid down <em>de novo</em> in differentiated patterns according to cell type in preparation for embryonic and placental development.</span></li>
</ol><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Primordial germ cell development (fetus sex dependent)</strong>. At mid-gestation of the fetus the primordial germ cells are reprogrammed. DNA methylation is removed from all the DNA except for repeated elements then specific marks required for these specialized cells are laid down.</span></li>
</ol><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4.4 During sensitive periods DNA is especially vulnerable to external influences from the environment such as drugs, alcohol, or even stress. Treating a cancer patient at these times may impact not just the patient but for a pregnant woman her developing fetus <strong>and</strong> his/her progeny.</span></p></div>
