    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cases, CTCF and H19 are unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, CTCF acts as an insulator so nearby enhancer regions act to express H19. They do not reach the Igf2 region. Therefore, Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, CTCF and H19 are normally methylated. The enhancer effect therefore bypasses them and causes Igf2 to be expressed.</p>
<p>So, in normal cases, Igf2 is expressed on only one of the two alleles.</p>
<p>When imprinting is disrupted at this cluster, the maternal CTCF and H19 are also methylated. Now, both alleles are expressing Igf2, and a double dose is produced.</p>
<p>This excess of Igf2 can cause Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are typically less methylated. In cancers, the CpG islands are typically more methylated, while other areas are less methylated.</p>
<p>This methylation is heritable, so cancer cells will propogate it to their daughters.</p>
<p>The increased methylation at the CpG islands results in reduced expression of the corresponding genes. When these are genes that play roles in tumor suppression, the consequence can be a tumor - the cells rapidly divides, and spread the cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in integenic regions and repetitive elements prevents the expression of those elements. DNA expression is reduced or eliminated in these areas, and they serve as blocks or insulators between active areas of genetic expression.</p>
<p>When a cancer (or other epigenetic damage) cause hypomethylation in these areas, more of the DNA is exposed. The consequences can include:</p>
<ul><li>Recombination, possibly triggering expression of harmful or incorrect proteins</li>
<li>Activation of repeats or their jumping to other areas of the genome</li>
<li>Transpositions of DNA sequences</li>
</ul><p>In a cancer, these effects can cause the activation of oncogenes, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and the spreading of the cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can maintain itself once established. Therefore, once the drug treatment has established the methylation, it can persist even after the treatment has stopped.<br />Sensitive periods are those in which the cell is changing or reestablishing epigenetic markings, such as during early embryonic development and germ cell reprogramming.<br />During these sensitve period, drugs that affect methylation or demethylation can potentially alter many areas of the epi/genome that are being modified at the same time. This can cause damage to many cellular processes and threaten the patient's health in multiple ways. It can also threaten the health of the patient's unborn children.<br />Therefore, these drugs would not be advisable during pregnancy (because of the early embryonic sensitive period) or during egg or sperm production in patients who intend to have kids (because of the sensitive period during germ cell production).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It will remove methyl markings from the DNA and thereby allow previously silenced sequences to be expressed.</p>
<p>Therefore, it can cause tumor-suppressing genes (typically genes that work against cell growth or replication) to become active. These genes can then fight or suppress the growth of the tumor.</p></div>
