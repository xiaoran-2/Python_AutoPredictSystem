    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer by becoming hypo or hypermethylated. CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, but in cancer CpG islands and CpG island shores become methylated contributing to disease by silencing tumour suppressor genes. In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated providing genomic stability. In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated resulting in genomic instability which causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruptions to neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions of imprinting can cause monoallelic parent of origin specific expression to become expressed or silent from both alleles. In regard to the H19/Igf2 cluster, on the paternal allele, the ICR and H19 is methylated allowing enhancers to act on and express Igf2. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated which binds the CTCF insulator element allowing enhancers to act on H19, but silencing Igf2. In Wilm’s tumour, there is hypermethylation of the maternal allele ICR, so both the maternal and paternal alleles become methylated and end up expressing a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and overexpression can contribute to disease by resulting in tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to inhibit DNA methyltransferase and can have an anti-tumour effect by allowing tumour-suppressor genes to become unmethylated and active again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is possible that drugs that alter DNA methylation can have an effect that lasts beyond the period of treatment because epigenetic changes are passed on through cell division and actively erased epigenetic changes do not return. Sensitive periods are times in which epigenetic marks are established. These include the blastocyst stage and development of primordial germ cells during embryogenesis/gametogenesis and ages between the years of 9-12 for males and 8-10 for females. During these periods, it would be inadvisable to introduce any drug that interferes with or alters the epigenetic marks that are being established because we have no way of knowing what the effect would be on the primordial germ cells.</p></div>
