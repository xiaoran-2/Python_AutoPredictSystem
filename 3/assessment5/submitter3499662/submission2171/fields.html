    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are DNA regions that contain a high frequency of C and G bases, and are found in the promoters of some genes. In normal cells, these CGIs are usually kept free from methylation. This process refers to a DNA modification by which methyl groups are added to the C bases at the carbon 5; the presence of this modification is <strong>inversely</strong> related with gene expression. Unlike normal cells, during cancer onset, cells display <strong>CGIs which are abnormally hypermethylated</strong> causing the disruption of the expression of genes containing those CGIs. This hypermethylation may be caused by mutations in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT1 or TET proteins. One of the mechanisms of cancer development is the silencing of expression of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs); these genes code for key regulators of uncontrolled cell growth and cell cycle and therefore avoid cancer progression in cells. Thus, when <strong>CGIs at the promoters of TSGs are abnormally hypermethylated, the expression of these genes is suppressed and cells are unprotected from uncontrolled growth and may progress to a cancerous stage.</strong>  </p>
<p>Contrary to the normal methylation status at CGIs, <strong>repetitive and intergenic regions are kept methylated</strong>. However, <strong>during cancer development, repetitive and intergenic sequences are deprived of the methyl groups</strong> and are said to be hypomethylated. This alteration may be caused by mutations in DNA methyltransferases such as DNMT1. The results of the hypomethylation at those sequences comprise activation of transposons, which may be cut/copied and be placed in others parts of the genome causing disruption of other genes; activation of cryptic promoters, which may  lead to transcription interference; and illegitimate recombination between repetitive sequences potentially causing chromosome translocations or indels.<strong> All of these results finally lead to genome instability, which is considered a mayor hallmark of cancer.</strong>   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting refers to a monoallelic expression established in some genes following a parent-of-origin manner. These imprinted genes are organized in clusters controlled by the methylation status of imprinting control regions (ICRs). The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted region that consists of the gene Igf2 that codes for an oncogene, the H19 gene which codes for a lncRNA, the ICR which is additionally a binding site for the insulator protein CTCF, and downstream enhancers which enhance the expression of either Igf2 or H19. The ICR in the <strong>paternal allele will normally be methylated</strong>, silencing H19 expression and a<strong>voiding the binding of the insulator protein to the ICR</strong>, this will allow the enhancer sequences to <strong>enhance Igf2 expression</strong>. On the other hand, the<strong> maternal ICR will not be methylated, CTCF will then bind the ICR</strong>, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers; the enhancers will then <strong>promote H19 expression but not Igf2´s.</strong> In the Wilm´s tumour neoplasm, the I<strong>CR in the maternal allele is abnormally methylated</strong>, causing this allele to behave like a paternal allele. Therefore, there will be an overexpression of Igf2. <strong>Igf2 is an oncogene</strong> and if overexpressed, it will promote uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As reversible epigenetic changes appear to have a determinant role in cancer development, new treatments using drugs comprised by small molecule inhibitors are now being tested in order to cope with uncontrolled epigenetic regulation. One of these drugs is <strong>Decitabine® which is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi)</strong>. Its use seems to be specially useful in some <strong>haematological malignancies that seem to be driven by CGI hypermethylation</strong>. As a nucleoside homolog, Decitabine® will be incorporated in the DNA, however, it will irreversibly bind to DNMT1 <strong>avoiding further methylation by this enzyme</strong>. Therefore, as cell replication proceeds, <strong>hypermethylated CGIs will be passively demethylated</strong>. This means that promoters of <strong>tumour suppressor genes will also be freed from hypermethylation, thus reestablishing the expression of these genes, and allowing restriction of uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation seen in cancer.</strong> As a DNMTi,   Decitabine® will have major anti-tumour effects.      </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a major epigenetic regulator that determines to a great extent chromatin architecture, and therefore, it is expected that <strong>drugs that affect DNA methylation will have major consequences in the epigenome and global gene expression patterns. These changes will be even more significant in rapidly dividing cells like those found in tumors</strong>. Certainly, changes in <strong>methylation patterns by drugs, will be passed to the daughter cells in the tumour and then to the next generation of cells</strong> and so on. <strong>This means that after drug treatment, epigenetic changes will be observed relatively long after drug administration</strong>. Even though these drugs are effective, its <strong>administration during sensitive periods is unacceptable.</strong> A sensitive period, is a <strong>period in development were epigenetic marks are being extensible reprogrammed. These include the pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell  (PGC) development, where extensive demethylation occurs to allow cell totipotency</strong>. In PGC development imprinted genes are additionally reprogrammed to allow parent-of-origin monoallelic expression. Therefore, administration of drugs that alter DNA methylation, <strong>will interfere with epigenetic reprogramming and with normal embryo development in general. </strong>It is therefore not advisable to administrate such drugs to pregnant women.</p></div>
