    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>The level of DNA methylation at CpG Island is closely related to tumor type. Therefore, DNA methylation at CpG Islands is used as a biomarker for prognosis, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of cancer.</p>
<p> In cancer cells, CpG Island at the promoter region (where transcription is initiated) of tumor suppressor gene is hyper methylated, resulting in a transcriptional silencing of the underlying gene.</p>
<p>Disruptions of DNA methylation via hyper methylation at CpG Island in promoter region of normal cells inhibit the transcription of essential growth regulator gene, and this may have a deleterious effect on the cell in the body.</p>
<p>DNA hyper methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements of normal cells is responsible for the maintenance of genomic integrity and stability. This is achieved through silencing of repeats to prevent transport and transcriptional interference from poor promoter, methylation of repeats to prevent illegitimate recombination and mutation of repeats to prevent substitution (conversion of meC to T).</p>
<p>In cancer cells, hypo methylation arises mainly from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated repeat elements, including satellites (e.g., SAT2) and retro transposons (e.g., LINEs), leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation. This leads to activation of repeats, transposons, and cryptic prompters</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA substantially obstruct the binding of transcriptional regulators to the gene, and more significantly, methylated DNA contributes in the formation of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modifications such as the histone code, polycomb complexes,  noncoding RNA, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins. The combinatorial effect of DNA methylation affects gene expression, therefore paving way for different form of disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to a class of drug called DAN de-methylation agent (DNMT Inhibitor). DNA methylation is responsible for controlling gene expression through silencing (hyper methylation) or activation (hypo methylation) of growth and regulatory gene.</p>
<p>Decitabine is converted to 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine di-phosphate by ribonucleotide reductase and subsequent phosphorylation, the triphosphate form is incorporated into DNA in place of the natural base cytosine. Because of the substitution of the 5' nitrogen atom in place of the carbon, the DNMTs are trapped on the substituted DNA strand and methylation is inhibited. By this process of de-methylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation substantially obstruct or promote the binding of transcriptional regulators and growth factors to the gene, and more significantly, DNA methylation contributes in the formation of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modifications such as the histone code, polycomb complexes, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNA, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins. This combinatorial effect of DNA methylation affects gene expression and it is mitotically inherited.</p>
<p>Sensitive period refers to the time during embryogenesis or gametogenesis when a change in environment has an effect on epigenetic control, due to the establishment rather than maintenance of epigenetic marks. Sensitive period include germ cell and pre-implantation development.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is when cell undergo epigenetic reprogramming and active remodeling of epigenetic marks. Therefore, treating a patient at this stage is catastrophic because it would interfere with normal epigenetic reprogramming of the cell and might result in an incomplete epigenetic reprogramming or laying down of wrong epigenetic marks.This disruption of epigenetic reprogramming can permanently alter epigenetic state, <span>which will be critical for adult-onset disease in the individual exposed.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 exhibit parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression. H19 is expressed from the maternal chromosome and Igf2 from the paternal. The two genes share enhancer elements and monoallelic expression of both genes is dependent on cis-acting sequences upstream of the H19 promoter. On the maternal allele the enhancer downstream of H19 has no access to the IGF2 promoters due to the boundary function of CTCF proteins bound to the un-methylated differentially methylated domain (DMD) whereas the H19 gene can still be transcribed. On the paternal allele DNA methylation at the H19 DMD eliminates the boundary function which leads to IGF2 gene transcription and silencing of the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumors with loss of imprinting (LOI), the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. This results in the overexpression of IGF2 and reduced expression of H19. Because H19 functions to slow cell growth and IGF2 stimulates cell growth, loss of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 locus results in uncontrolled cell growth that can lead to tumor formation.</p>
