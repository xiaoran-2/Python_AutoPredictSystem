    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically unmethylated, which helps them be less susceptible to mutations. However when CpG islans are methylated, this is a silencing epigenetic mark. This means that the normal function of methylation at CpG islands is the long-term silencing of gene expression, such as in the classic case of X-chromosome inactivation. DNA methylation is also associated with chromatin organization, imprinting, and stable heritable modifications. </p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation undergoes complex distortions. The cancer epigenome is marked by genome-wide hypomethylation and site specific Cpg island promoter hypermetylation - that is, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. The methylation in some islands becomes more dense, and this density tends to progress with time. DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence tumor supressor genes (meaning that genes that inhibit cell growth will be silenced).</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpGi contributes to disease because it alters the expression of genes, and these changes are mitotically heritable - this means that the genes will be permanentely silenced, since the methylation mark will be passed on through mitosis and maintained in the daughter cells.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity and stability, by silencing non-coding DNA and transposable DNA elements (that is, silencing repeats to prevent transpositions and transcriptional interference from strong promoters).</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA hypomethylation of these regions reults in abnormal karyotypes due to genomic instability. The abnormal karyotypes could be deletions, reciprocal translocations, or insertions.</p>
<p>DNA hypomethylation in these regions results in loss of active and repetitive marks, which is problematic because many of the genes involved are part of important cellular processes (ie DNA repair, cell cycle, cell adhesion and apoptosis). Therefore these changes contribute to many diseases, not only cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that causes DNA demethylation. That is, there is a drug induced reduction of DNA methylation that causes growth inhibition in cancer cells, by activating tumor suppressor genes that were aberrantly silenced in cancer. Decitabine has been approved for use in mylodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</p>
<p>In this particular case, Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into the DNA of rapidly growing tumor cells during replication, and inhibits DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferases onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell. That is why we say that Decitabine has an anti- neoplastic effect  (it kills tumor cells by causing DNA demethylation).</p>
<p>While its precise mechanism of action is still unclear, we do know that at low dosis Decitabine hits all dividing cells and therefore has an anti tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting, the process by which only one gene copy is expressed, can contribute to cancer when there are disruptions. In the H19/Igf2 example, the following occurs:</p>
<p>In the <strong>maternal</strong> allele the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated, and in the <strong>paternal</strong> allele the ICR is methylated.</p>
<p>In the<strong> maternal</strong> allele, the insulator protein CTCF binds to the ICR, insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. These enhancers are then able to act on H19 and enhance its expression.</p>
<p>By contrast, in the <strong>paternal</strong> allele, DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF. Since the insulator protein can no longer bind, the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and activate it. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal - so there is too much Igf2 promoting growth. This is further complicated because at the same time there is no Cdkn1c expression. </p>
<p>These disruptions show that loss of expression of growth restricting genes and the overexpression of growth promoting genes can cause disease - it has been proved that these types of alterations happen in several types of tumors, and are most commonly observed in pre neoplastic tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are mitotically heritable, which means that an epigenetic pattern can be maintained even after the initiating signal is removed. That is why alterations to the DNA methylation can have enduring effects on our epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of active remodelling of the epigenome, when the removal and/or laying down of epigenetic marks takes place at different parts of the genome.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development: </p>
<p>1) the primordial cell development (this period goes all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm), and</p>
<p>2) the pre implantation period and early post implantation period</p>
<p>Treating patients withe epigenetic therapy during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because we do not know what effect the drugs will have on (a) the patient's germ cells, and on (b) the imprinting and removing of epigenetic marks in other somatic cells. </p></div>
