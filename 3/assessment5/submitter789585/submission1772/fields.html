    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in DNA, which are mostly found near promoters, are unmethylated in normal cells and this allows the expression of the gene downstream. In cancer cells, however, CpG islands, particularly those near the promoter of tumor suppressor genes, become hypermethylated. This means that the tumor suppressor genes cannot be expressed and thus, the cells grow without control. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repeats are typically methylated in normal cells as these epigenetic modifications help maintain the heterochromatin state, therefore, avoiding unnecessary translocations and recombinations. By contrast, cancer cells have hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, inducing several damaging consequences to the chromosome such as illegitimate recombinations, transpositions, unnecessary insertions and deletions, and even disruption of neighboring genes. Essentially, these events bring about genomic instability, which is one of the hallmarks in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting is also a hallmark in cancer cells. Imprinted genes are genes that exhibit parent-of-origin specific expression, whereby only one allele from either the mother or the father is active. The other allele is normally silenced through epigenetic modifications. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprinting control region (ICR) in the paternal allele is normally methylated while the maternal allele is not. The transcription factor CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR and effectively blocks enhancer access to the maternal Igf2 gene. Instead, the maternal H19 gene will be expressed. Along with the ICR, the H19 gene in the paternal allele is also methylated thus, the enhancer will induce the expression of the paternal Igf2 gene. In Wilm's tumor cells,  both alleles are found to be hypermethylated in the ICR and H19 gene. Hence, the enhancers will induce expression of both Igf2 alleles. It contributes to cancer development because the Igf2 gene encodes for a growth-promoting hormone that eventually, could trigger uncontrolled cell growth if not kept in check.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors which also include the drug Vidaza. They are hypomethylating agents that disrupt the normal methylation of certain sites in the genome such as repeats and intergenic regions. These inhibitors are normally used to combat Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Decitabine is a cystidine analogue, which is a molecule that is similar to nucleoside cystidine, that gets incorporated to the DNA during replication. After incorporation, the DNA methyltransferases then irreversibly bind to the analogue, preventing the enzyme to perform methylation in other portions of the genome. This effect is then copied for every replication cycle and since cancer cells replicate and divide indefinitely, they are more severely affected than normals cells. At larger doses, though, it is also highly detrimental to normals cells since normal cells also divide.</p></div>
