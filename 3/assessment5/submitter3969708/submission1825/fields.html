    <h1>Submission 1825 from Anon (session_user_id: 065469b215599c9446e6adcdf85091b625062579)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that acts as a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). The drug molecules act as nucleoside analogues, which insert into the patient’s DNA during replication. DNMTs will bind irreversibly to decitabine, preventing the methyl transferase enzymes from functioning. Consequently, the original DNA methylation pattern will not be transferred to the daughter strand, leading to cell death.</p>
<p>Because cancer cells replicate more frequently than normal cells, tumors are more severely targeted and the drug has an anti-neoplastic (tumor suppressing) effect. Although there have been concerns over the specificity of the drug because it targets all dividing cells, patient trials have shown good efficacy for the treatment of AML with unexpectedly low side-effects. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One crucial aspect of epigenetic states is their mitotic inheritability. Changes to the epigenetic pattern including DNA methylation will propagate from mother to daughter cells during DNA replication, e.g. by DNA methyl transferase enzymes. This means that if a drug influences the epigenetic state of one cell, any changes will also appear in its descendants. Thus, such drugs can have long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>In mammalian development, there are several sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming, during which the epigenome is cleared and reset. The first of these periods occurs during early development, prior to implantation of the embryo. Disruption of epigenetic machinery during this phase (either for clearing or resetting) is likely to prevent establishment of the proper epigenetic state.. Such epigenetic malfunctions may result in lifelong disease or even make the embryo unviable. (These complications are similar to what is observed in cloning, in which this first stage is bypassed entirely.)</p>
<p>The second sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development (PGC). In this phase, primordial germ cells are reprogrammed to indicate their maternal or paternal ordering. Epigenetic treatments during this period may lead to imprinting disorders in the patient’s children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster includes a set of imprinted genes, each of which is expressed by one parental chromosome. As with many cases of genomic imprinting, genetic expression of this cluster is controlled by epigenetic marks on single imprint control region (ICR). Unlike epigenetic control at CpG islands (where methylation is synonymous with gene silencing), methylation of the ICR can result in a variety of locus specific mechanisms, causing either gene silencing or activation.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster provides an interesting case study. Here, the paternal ICR is normally methylated, whereas the maternal ICR is unmethylated. In the paternal chromosome, enhancers downstream of the ICR are able to act on Igf2, allowing expression. In the maternal chromosome, CTCF, an insulator protein, binds to the unmethylated ICR and causes the chromatin structure to distort. This distortion prevents enhancers from accessing Igf2, and the gene is silenced.</p>
<p>In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the maternal chromosome at the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, resembling the paternal chromosome. Now, CTCF cannot bind and Igf2 expression is enhanced on both chromosomes and the patient receives of double dose of the gene. Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene and overexpression results in formation of WIlm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands–genetic regions with an atypically high density of CpG dinucleotides—are located at the promoters of many genes. Methylation of the CpG islands typically leads to silencing of the associated genes. In most cells, this epigenetic function plays an essential role in DNA regulation and allows for differentiation between cell types. For instance, neurons and muscle cells exhibit very different phenotypes despite having an identical genetic make-up.</p>
<p>In cancer, researchers typically observe hypermethylation of CpG islands. In particular, this methylation is associated with silencing of tumor suppressor genes.  According to Knudsen’s hypothesis, multiple simultaneous mutations or epigenetic changes to such genes result in uncontrolled, cancerous cell-growth.</p>
<p>               CpG dinucleotides also appear in other regions of the genome—intergenic regions and repetitive elements—although at much lower densities. These regions are genetically unstable and contain transposons and restriction enzyme sites which are prone to jump around the genome, causing insertions, deletions, duplications and other genetic errors. Methylation of these regions prevents reorganization and increases their stability. In this manner, the epigenetic state may directly affect a cell’s genetic integrity.</p>
<p> In normal cells, these regions are typically methylated, whereas in cancerous cells hypomethylation is observed. Instability of tumor genomes may cause duplication of oncogenes or deletion of tumor suppressor genes. In either case, such genetic alterations can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.</p></div>
