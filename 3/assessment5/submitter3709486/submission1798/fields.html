    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be found at the promoters of genes. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually protected from methylation –that is, they are hypomethylated- <strong>but when they are methylated the gene is silenced</strong>. In contrast, in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell, that is, they are hypermethylated. Since CpG islands can be found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, hypermethylation results in epigenetic silencing of these tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes have a repressive effect on the regulation of the cell cycle or promote apoptosis, thus, their silencing leads to constant proliferation of cells, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. </p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Methylation in these regions helps maintain genomic integrity and avoid genomic instability. Methylation at intergenic regions also silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites, while methylation at repetitive elements silences repeats to prevent transposition and to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability, which results in deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Repeats can also be activated by hypomethylation: they can make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome, and depending on where they integrate the can disrupt a gene or they may activate neighboring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 locus is methylated on the paternal allele. CTCF will not bind to the imprint control region because it is methylated and there will be expression from Igf2 but not from H19. In contrast, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 locus is not methylated on the maternal allele. When unmethylated, CTCF will bind to the imprint control region and H19 will be expressed from the maternal allele but Igf2 will be silenced. In Wilms’ tumor, imprinting is lost, so there is also hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele and Igf2 will also be expressed from the maternal allele. This results in a double dose of Igf2 in cancer cells in comparison to normal cells. Since Igf2 promotes growth, cells can divide more rapidly, which constitutes one of the hallmarks of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (also known as hypometylating agent), that inhibits DNA methylation. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase: since Decitabine is a nucleoside analog it gets incorporated into DNA upon replication, so when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it and copy the methylation to the DNA daughter strand, the methyltransferase is bound irreversibly to Decitabine and it can no longer be released. Since the action of this DNA methyltransferase inhibitor is division-dependent, the cell has to replicate so that the drug can be effective. Given that cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells they are more severely affected by Decitabine. In these cells, Decitabine-induced hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation silences gene expression in cells. Since this epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable, altering of DNA methylation can result in genomic instability that can lead to altered physiological states such as cancer. </p>
<p>DNA methylation is removed twice during development: one is from the time of primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm and the second is the preimplantation and early post implantation period. Both of these are sensitive periods, since there is active reprogramming that includes removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome, making these periods more sensitive to changes in the environment. These environmental changes can influence the epigenetic makeup of the cell.</p>
<p>In younger patients, there is a sensitive period that corresponds to germ cell maturation. Most epigenetic drugs target enzymatic epigenetic regulators. These  drugs are likely to be used throughout the body, so every cell has the potential to be affected. Thus, younger patients should be treated with caution to avoid inhibiting the epigenetic machinery of developing germ cells, since alterations in the epigenetic state of germs cells have the potential to induce changes that can be passed on to the offspring.</p>
