    <h1>Submission 111 from Anon (session_user_id: 0ed89b9411b34b2f023c75471e35569129cb57cd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Different classes of cancer drugs, function by either hyper- or hypo- methylate target DNAs, or inhibit histone-deacetylase. Decitabine belongs to the DNA de-methylation group. It acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. DNA methylation is laid down by DNA methyltransferase by transfering methyl group to CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation can prevent transcription factor's binding to the gene, therefore inhibit gene expression. Decitabine can incorporate into DNA and inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, Decitabine can therefore reactivate the target genes, possibly increase tumor-suppressor gene expression, stops tumor growth and kills tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells whole different levels of epienetic changes happen, which include DNA hypermethylation, DNA hypomethylation, histone modification, altered non-coding RNA expression, nuclear and chromatin disorganization. There are genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylations. Altered DNA methylations can have enduring effects. DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1. During cell division, unmethylated DNA strand (hemi-methylated DNA) is methylated by DNMT1, so the methylations are maitained in all daughter cells. Therefore DNA methylations are mitotically heritable and have long lasting effect on the epigenome. But epigenetic changes can be erased during sensitive periods of development. Those sesitive periods include primodial germ cell development and pre-implantation periods. During those periods, epigenetic marks are erased and re-established such as X inactivation, parent-of-origin gene expression,etc. Epigenetic anti-cancer drugs work by altering epigentic status through DNA hyper- or hypo-methylation,ect. The treatment should avoid the sensitive periods mentioned above, so the drugs won't interfere with epigenetic marks' erasing and re-establishemnt and causing damage on cell's normal development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands usually exist as clusters at genes' promoter region. In normal cells, the CpG islands usually are protected from DNA methylation, so normal gene expressions won't be disrupted. In cancer cells, there are CpG island hypermethylation which silence affected gene expression. CpG island methylation is asociated with repressive chromatin structure formation, or methylation can prohibit the binding of transcription factors. If this happens at the tumor suppressor genes, the disruption of tumor suppressor gene expression can cause cancer cells divide uncontrollably. There is also hypermethylation at CpG island shores, which is related to gene expression and detected in different tumor cell lines.</p>
<p>Oposite to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are usually methylated. Methylation in those intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not for silencing normal gene expressions. Instead the methylaions help maintaining genome integrity and stability; silencing cryptic transcription sites and cryptic splicing sites; preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination; preventing transcription interference from strong promoters. In cancers, there can be genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and also regional gain of DNA methylation. When DNA hypomethylation happens in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, they lead to genome instability by causing chromsome deletions, intersions or reciprocal translocations. Hypomethylation in repetitive elements can activate strong promoters and disrupt downstream gene's normal expression and cause disease and cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cels, ICR of the H19/Igf2 locus is methylated on paternal allele but unmethylated on maternal allele. Because of the methylation status of ICR, CTCF and its cofactors can not bind to ICR on paternal allele. This blocks enhancer access upstream Igf2 promoter on maternal allele, allow enhancer to access Igf2 on paternal allele. So igf2 is silenced on maternal allele and only expressed on paternal alele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor cells, there is methylation of ICR from both parental alleles. CTCF and its cofactors cannot bind to ICR on either allele. The enhancer can access Igf2 promoter on both parental alleles. This cause Igf2 expression from both parental alleles and double the gene dose compare to normal cells. Since Igf2 is involved in cell growth, loss of Igf2 imprinting from paternal allele cause Wilm's tumor in children.</p></div>
