    <h1>Submission 30 from Anon (session_user_id: ef5bf522c7c1514e0b920ba241d287c84113523f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent, or a DNMT inhibitor. They irreversibly bind DNMTs after being incorporated into DNA, leading to overall DNA demethylation. Considering some tumours are caused by hypermethylation of CpG islands in certain genes (such as RB, MLH1, BRCA1, MGMT), Decitabine could help revert the daughter cells into a non-tumoural state after replication of the parent cell (since DNMT inhibitors only act after being incorporated during replication) by lowering the methylation level of those CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele has a methylated ICR, which blocks the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, the H19 promoter is methylated, silencing H19 and allowing enhancers to activate Igf2 (Igf2 is expressed).</p>
<p>The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, which allows for the binding of CTCF. As such, CTCF insulates Igf2 from the enchancers and H19 is expressed instead (Igf2 is silenced).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, namely the variant caused by Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele, leading to an overexpression of Igf2 (there may be a loss of imprinting or paternal uniparental disomy).</p>
<p>This overexpression of Igf2 (which is an oncogene, due to having a growth promoting effect) leads to fetal and post-natal overgrowth and causes a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours, such as Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually located near gene promoters, which results in them being sites of transcription control. CpG island methylation is usually correlated with silencing of the gene whose promoter is near, since it may inhibit transcription factor binding and seems to be associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure. In some types of cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated comparatively to their usual state - in tumours, such CpG islands are associated with tumour suppressing genes. Disrupting the transcription of tumour suppressing genes (or housekeeping genes) leads to a disruption of the cell's behaviour, and consequently to a tumoural state.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation present in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to maintain genomic integrity (preventing transposition and recombination) and defend it against transposable elements. In cancer, this DNA methylation type is present in a much lesser number (genome-wide hypomethylation). This may lead to genomic instability and, if found near certain CpG islands/promoters, to oncogene activation, and consequently to a tumoural state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First of all, it is known that the environment may have effects on an organism's epigenome even when not in a sensitive period. When patients are exposed to drugs that alter DNA methylation in a frequent way, there may be permanent effects to DNA methylation and chromatin structure that last long after the exposure has ceased. Those permanent effects, that alter the epigenome, could lead to disease and various, serious side-effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of reprogramming, where the epigenetic marks present in the organism are cleared and reset (albeit some imprinted repeats may be kept). Examples of such periods are the post-fertilization period nearly until the epiblast stage, and gametogenesis.</p>
<p>Treating patients during those sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs could irreversibly alter much of their epigenetic state, because it is still in a <em>tabula rasa</em> state and the drugs could affect the reprogramming process. As such, there should be extreme care in treating patients that are in sensitive periods of epigenetic development.</p></div>
