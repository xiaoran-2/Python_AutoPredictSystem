    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is fundamently activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressors in the genome, initiated by aberrations either genetically and/or epigenetically (and may be additive). Epigenetically DNA methylation, histone modifications or histone variants, nuclear architecture or noncoding RNAs are  possible places for things to go wrong.</p>
<p>DNA methylation (which is mitotically heritable) is recognized as one of the possible “hits” in the Knudson hypothesis (that cancer is often a result of multiple “hits” to DNA).  In cancer DNA methylation decreases but increases at CpG islands, which are normally unmethylated, particularly those preceding gene promoters. It appears important for the structural stability of the DNA  to keep them unmethylated as this makes the region around each island more stable, which may be due to the stacking interactions with the hydrogen bonds. If an island is methylated stabilization of surrounding diminishes.  DNA methylation is also directly mutogenic as 5 methylcytosine can transform to thymine with the loss of NH2. If the dinucleotides were methylated in these regions, the genes promoters and promoter “shores” close to them would be less likely to be transcribed (the region may be silenced). Then in cancer at CpG islands areas expected to be unmethylated are hypermethylated,  i.e. normal methylation profile is inverted, and particularly preceding tumour suppressor  genes. Locus specific silencing of such tumor suppressor genes can ensue.  Methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected and take over at specific locuses leading to cancer initiation and progression.     </p>
<p>Normaly, individual CpG dinucleotides tend to be methylated in intergenic regions, repetitive elements and at introns of genes.  According to Prof Bestor DNA methylation needs to have a specific purpose as it would not be selected and this purpose is to maintain the integrity of the genome, silencing the expression of strong promoters therefore reduces deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. In cancer, these dinucleotides tend to be hypomethylated, inappropriately activating particular locations of these transposable elements, possibly causing mutations and activating oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans about 150 genes imprint either on the maternal or paternal allele i.e. one allele is silenced so genes are expressed from the non-imprinted allele. Imprinting is tissue specific (most imprinting in the placenta or brain), generally in clusters; each cluster has an imprint control region (ICR) and a mode of action, usually DNA methylation (which does not necessarily act to regionally silence) and histone modulation. Disruption of imprinting is common in cancer because the silencing or unsilencing often involves genes related to rapid growth. </p>
<p>On chromosome 11 there is a megabase section which, disrupted can lead to Wilms’ Tumour in children.</p>
<p>Normally, in the region of the H19/Igf2 cluster the maternal allele has the unmethylated imprint control region (between Igf2 and H19) bound by CTCF, an insulator protein. This blocks Igf2 from the enhancers beyond gene H19. The enhancers act on H19 and downstream only. While the paternal allele has the ICR methylated (CTCF cannot bind), the H19 and surrounding silenced (packed into heterochromatin) and the downstream enhancers enhance Igf2.</p>
<p> Loss of imprinting by methylation of the maternal allele leads to upregulation of Igf2 which is a growth promoter (oncogene) this can be further enhanced if Cdkn1c (an upstream tumour suppressor is also silenced). Other disruptions (enhancing Igf2) such as unipaternal disomy has similar effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a group of drugs which produce anticancer effects on DNA by hypomethylation, the drug reacts and is incorporated into the DNA strand releasing the methyl  group. In some blood cancers (and related disorders) it has been noticed that DNA has silenced or inactivated tumour suppressor genes by methylation of CpGs in the region of the disrupted or diseased sites.  The aim is to reactivate the tumour suppressor genes of the host. Mitosis should then continue the normalisation. A recent paper* has found, by profiling methylsomes of  bone marrow, pre and post day 25 (induction) treatment in patients with Acute Myleloid  Leukaemia (AML) Decitabine significantly reduced methylation and predominantly at the CpG islands suggesting differential activity. This would be required as only some sections of the DNA would show aberrant methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>The epigenetic changes in cell DNA which induce cancer (such as methylation and therefore suppression of tumour suppressor genes) could allow changing back to normal cell DNA by drug therapy (by DNMT inhibitors for instance). This changing of DNA methylation would have long term effects because, provided the epigenetic modification was just a one off problem with other no chemical or structural anomalies, any mitotic cell division will incorporate the change (demethylation) in the DNA. Normally in humans, remethylation and demethylation occur generally only in reprogramming of the genome, that is at early embryonic development (between fertilization and implantation) and during germ cell development for the primordial cells. At this time, epigenetic marks are cleared to restore totipotency and the laid done in tissue specific ways. This time is considered to be the sensitive period of development because epigenetic marks are being removed and restored at varying rates and slightly differently in paternal and maternal alleles. Chemical bonds are being broken and the chromatin structure is changing, for instance in sperm cells it is very compacted not with normal histones, interferences may have unintended and damaging consequences. </p>
