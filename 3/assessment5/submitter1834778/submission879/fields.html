<p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation is adding CH3 to Cytosine or Adenine. It related to genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and cancer. </span></p>
<ul><li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in CpG island. In normal cell DNA hypermethylation related to tissue differentiation.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancers, increasing in the epigenetic methylation of cytosine and adenine residues in DNA results in silencing  tumor suppressor genes. Alterations of DNA methylation is one of hallmarks of cancer development. </span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hypomethylation arises earlier can result in activation of genes, linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. </span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Hypermethylation is a good target for epigenetic therapy.CpG island hypermethylation related to single gene such as RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer. use DNA hypermethylation single biomarkers can distinguish cancer from normal cells in the same sample. </span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>Nomal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to repress the expression of potentially harmful genetic elements.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In cancer hypermethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals lead to genomic instability.</span></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><span>In mouse model hypomethylation due to deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissues increases genomic instability. Also in human disease mutation in DNMT3B result in ICF syndrome.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p dir="ltr"><span>In conclusion, normally DNA methylation at CpG islands is like a switch turn off the cancer gene, However in cancer cell DNA methylation will turn off the cancer suppression gene lead to chromosomal instability.</span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aNO3KggK92AitFBu3Bu9PvbXrMKo1Rxjs2tx0lIupJ4PFnSNF-z8Ug6eReIMr9OjllmgDt9oil278C4V0bs4_BDyEHwZmgnUSJeUpOPf_YXQiTT7XxO8oGvj" alt="" /></p>

answer include the following points:

<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>

    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
