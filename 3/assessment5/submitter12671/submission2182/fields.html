    <div class="field-value"><p>The majority of cytosines in the context of CpG dinucleotides in the genome are methylated. An important exception to this rule are CpG islands – regions showing and enrichment in CpG dinucleotides that are also hypomethylated. CpG islands are found in the promoters of move than half of the genes in the genome. If they are methylated this is associated with gene silencing, whereas hypomethlation if associated with gene expression. In contrast, in cancer cells, the genome as a whole is hypomethylated whereas promoters with CpG islands are hypermethylated. Increased methylation is found particularly in the shores of the CpG islands – 2kb regions either side of the CpG island. The increased level of methylation of these promoters is associated with silencing of the expression of the genes they control. The silencing of tumour suppressor genes can lead to cancer as one of the multiple hits required to transform a cell according to the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The DNA in intergenic regions, and in particular in regions containing repetitive elements or insertions of retrotrasposons such as LINES and SINES, is normally methylated. The purpose of this methylation is to silence transcription from these elements. In cancer these regions are hypomethylated and they are therefore no longer silenced and compacted into heterochromatin. This can lead to genome instability due inappropriate interchromosomal recombination between repeats or due to the generation of double strand breaks by inappropriate activation of transposons. Such recombination can lead to chromosome mis-segragation during mitosis leading to aneuploidy. Furthermore, if the chromosomal translocations occur in regions that regulate oncogenes, these can be inappropriately expressed leading to cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 locus is subject to parental imprinting. In normal cells, the paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR), blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein and allowing the enhancer elements to loop round and activate the Igf2 gene. In contrast, an absence of methylation of the maternal allele at the ICR allows the binding of CTCF which blocks the interaction between the enhancers and the Igf2 gene, and instead these enhancers now activate the H19 locus.In Wilm´s tumour, hypermethylation of the ICR occurs in both maternal and paternal alleles. As a result the expression pattern of both alleles resembles that of the paternal allele: active Igf2 expression and decreased H19 expression. Igf2 is a growth factor and can promote the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, therefore its overexpression is will contribute to tumour progression  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold as Dacogen by a Japanese company called Deisai, is a member of a class of drugs that cause the de-methylation of DNA. As such, the drug can target the methyl group that is attached to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides. Increased levels of methylation of these dinucleotides in CpG islands in the promoters of genes is a common feature of many cancers. Hypermethylation of promoters is associated with silencing of gene expression. In cancer cells the promoters of tumour suppressor genes are often hypermethylated leading to a loss of their expression. DNA de-methylating agents such as Decitabine can remove the inappropriate methylation of these promoters thus restoring the expression of tumor suppressor proteins, allowing them to stop the growth of cancer cells. Dicatabine has been used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be stably inherited through cell devision. Due ot the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication, the patterns of methylation on the paternal DNA are present on one of the two strands of the replicated molecules. This pattern is then copied to the second strand by maintenance DNA methylases such as DNMT1. Therefore treating a cancer cell with a a drug that alters its methylation pattern could affect the pattern of methylation on all the daughter cells of that cancer cell thus prolonging the effects of the treatment beyond the actual period of during which the drug is administered. </p>
<p>There are some periods in development which are particularly sensitive to pertubation of DNA methylation. These include early embryonic development and during the development of the germ cells. These periods are senstiive becuase the genome undergoes a global erasure of DNA methylation marks followed by de novo methylation by the DNMT3 protein to set up the appropriate methylation patterns required for organismal development or for germ cell imprinting and maturation. Treating patients with epigenetic durgs during such sensitive periods, could significantly disrupt the establishment of normal patterns of DNA methylation and is therefore not advisable.</p></div>
