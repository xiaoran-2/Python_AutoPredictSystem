    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, methylation of cytosines at CpG islands located nearby a gene inhibits the expression of that gene. Besides of using methylation at CpG islands for transcriptional regulation, the modification is usually found in intergenetic regions and at repetitive elements. Here, DNA methylation is used to maintain genomic stability. For example, at intergenic regions methylation of CpG islands silences cryptic transcription start sites. On the other hand, methylation at long terminal repeats prevents transposition of genes.</p>
<p>Cancer cells often show global changes in DNA methylation like hypermethylation of CpG islands. If this hypermethylation occurs at genes expressing tumor suppressors, those suppressors aren’t present anymore in the cell. Thus, mutations can occur more frequently and the cell can proliferate without being stopped by cellular signals. In fact, hypermethylation of tumor suppressors is often found in retinoblastoma or breast cancer. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements that show usually a high methylation pattern are hypomethylated in cancer cells. For example, if repeats are hypomethylated, they can align on other chromosomal regions containing similar repeats and recombination can take place. This would then end up in reciprocal translocation. The translocation then can lead to genomic instability if a constitutive promoters is then located upstream of a gene that supports proliferation. Hypomethylation of a promoter resulting in expression of a gene that is usually silenced in the cell is another possibility that can occur in cancer cells. Activation of gene expression is found in some tumors like gastric cancer or glioma.</p>
<p>However, there have to be more than one mutation promoting tumorgenesis and it is always important to look at the context dependency of the hypo- or hepermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Recently, drugs that target the epigenetic machinery are used as treatment against cancer. One of the classes of epigenetic inhibitors are DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis). These drugs are nucleoside analogues that can bind DNMTs irreversibly. One of the DNMTis that is currently used for cancer treatment as demethylating agent is Decitabine. </p>
<p title="Acute myeloid leukemia">As Decitabine can enter any cell, it is possible that DNA of normal cells can be altered as well. However, especially patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that has progressed to acute myeloid leukamie (AML) show a positive reaction when treated with Decitabine. This effect could be explained by looking at the CpG islands in MDS which tend to be hypermethylated. This aberrant methylation results in silencing the expression of tumor suppressors. By inhibiting DNMT, Decitabine induces hypomethylation of the CpG islands and thus expression of tumor suppressors is activated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes display parental-specific expression. A well understood example is the Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) gene. The ICR (imprinted control region) of the Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele is unmethylated. This is why at the ICR, the protein CTCF can bind enhancing the expression of the long-coding RNA H19. Moreover, CTCF recruitment causes silencing of the maternal Igf2 gene. However, on the paternal allele, ICR is methylated which is why CTCF cannot bind. Thus, the promoter of H19 is methylated resulting in heterochromatin formation of the H19 locus. Because of this formation, the enhancers can reach the Igf2 gene upstream of the ICR and stimulate its expression.</p>
<p>In many cancer cells, parental imprinting of the Igf2 cluster is disrupted. Here, silencing of Igf2 on the maternal allele is not processed anymore. This can be originated from hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. In this case, Igf2 is expressed on both alleles resulting in its overexpression. Because the protein Igf2 promotes growth and proliferation, high levels of it can stimulate tumorgenesis. This effect can be seen in Wilm’s tumor. As Igf2 is predominantly active in embryonic differentiation, a kidney carcinoma can develop in early childhood.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By using drugs that alter DNA methylation in cancer treatment, epigenetic processes are changed. DNA methylation is maintained by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that recognises hemi-methylated DNA after replication. If DNMT1 is inhibited, the methylation will be decreased with every cell cycle. If a <em>de novo</em> methyltransferase is inhibited, DNA methylation cannot take place. In both cases the epigenome will change. In cancer cells, this effect is used for example to activate transcription of genes that are hypermethylated in an abnormal manner. However, the drugs result in uncontrolled hypomethylation of different genes that might have various cell effects. This is why the usage of such drugs in sensitive periods in childhood development can be dangerous. Such periods are stages in which children complete development of the brain and other organs, the immune system or gain physical growth.</p>
<p>Long-term consequences of such drugs are not concidered for patients that are older as the use of the drug is for expanding the life-span, not for survival. However, in children, long-term consequences are important to look at because alteration of methylation could affect the development of organs resulting in developmental disorder or lethal consequences.</p></div>
