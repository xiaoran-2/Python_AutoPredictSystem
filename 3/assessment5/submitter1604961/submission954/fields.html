    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ans:</strong><span>The modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base (5 mC) is found in approximately 70–80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells and to some extend in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells (ESC) </span><span>. DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin</span><span>. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression</span><span>. Exceptions are CpG <span>islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters</span><span>. They have a high CpG density and are usually </span><span>kept free of methylation independent of their activity state</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><strong>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer</strong><br /></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><strong>Ans:</strong><span> in cancer cells promoter CpG </span><span>islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumor supressor genes in cancer.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease</strong><br /></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>ANS: </strong>locus specific DNA hypermethlation. CpG island &amp; CpG island shores of tumor supressor gene, ICRs loss of imprintings</span></span></span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span><span><span><strong>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements</strong></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Ans</strong><strong>:</strong><span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of </span><span>retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions &amp; repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer</strong></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Ans;</strong><span>Methylation of H3K9 is found in regions of DNA methylation, whereas H3K4me3 and DNA methylation occur mutually exclusive. Different HMTs including G9a, SUV39H1, EZH2 can direct DNA methylation via direct or indirect recruitment of DNMTs </span><span>, which might be a mechanism for </span><em>de novo</em><span>methylation of DNA in ESC but appears to be nonessential for maintenance of methylation in differentiated cells </span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions &amp; repititive elements contributes to disease</strong></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><strong>Ans:</strong><span>Numerous changes in modification patterns have also been observed at the level of posttranslational histone modifications .</span></span></span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome</strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS:</strong>Altering DNA mrthylation can have enduring effects on epigenome because DNA methylation is the inherited epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is maintained by DnMT1.</li>
<li><strong>Define what is meant by sensitive period</strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS:</strong>Sesitive period is a period when altered enviornment has an effect on epigenetic control.</li>
<li><strong>identify sensitive periods of development</strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS:</strong> The periods of development that are sensitive includes the period from primordial germ cell development all the way to the development of gametes(sperms &amp; Ova) is one sensitive period the second sensitive period is pre implantation to early post implantation that include fertalized egg, Blastocyst, Epiblast.</li>
<li><strong>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</strong></li>
<li>ANS:Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because<strong> </strong>Sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of genome, in these active periods of reprograming we have removal &amp; laying down of epigenetic marks, these are periods which are most sensitive to changes in the enviornment.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong><span>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to. </span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span>ANS:</span></strong><span>Decitabine belongs to class of DNMT inhibitors.</span></li>
<li><strong><span><span>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.</span></span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span><span>ANS:</span></span></strong><span><span>They were used in 70s in very high doses &amp; in those doses they were very toxic, recently they are used in much lower doses &amp; in these lower doses we have very good antineoplastic affect &amp; seem to be causing DNA methylation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong><span><span><span>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</span></span></span></strong></li>
<li><strong><span><span><span>ANS: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Decitabine which is DNMT inhibitor is Nuceloside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, &amp; is therefore replication dependent.</span></span></span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><strong><strong>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele &amp; how this determines Igf2 expression status</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS:</strong>Imprint control region is methylated on paternal allele, in the paternal allele enhancer can bind to Igf2 because CTCF is not binding &amp; Igf2 is expressed from paternal allele.</li>
<li><strong><span>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2 expression status.</span></strong></li>
<li><strong></strong><strong>ANS:</strong> Imprint control region is unmethylated on maternal allele,CTCF bind to imprint control region so the enhancer will act on H19, Igf2 will be silenced from the maternal allele &amp; there is no expression of Igf2.</li>
<li><strong><strong>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm's tumor.</strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS</strong>:In Wilms tumor imprinting is lost &amp; with this loss of imprinting there is hypermethylation of imprint control region on the maternal allele &amp; in maternal allele there is expression of Igf2.</li>
<li><strong>Explain how disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</strong></li>
<li><strong>ANS:</strong> With loss of imprinting &amp; hypermethylation of imprint control region there is expression of Igf2 on maternal allele &amp; now there is a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to normal &amp; Igf2 is growth promotor &amp; is associated with Wilm's tumor<br /><br /></li>
