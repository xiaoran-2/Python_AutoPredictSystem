    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of DNA was mostly found in CpG islands in somatic cells and serves as epigenetic markers for X chromosome inactivation and imprinting. In promoter regions, the level of methylation of DNA inversely correlated with gene expression. However, the CpG islands in promoter regions were not correlated with transcriptional activity. On the contrary, cancer cells have higher methylation levels in the CpG islands within promoter regions. These may lead to reduced expression or silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Other than methylation at promoter regions, intergenic regions containing many repetitive sequences can be methylated to maintain the stability of genomes. Methylation of intergenic region also suppress alternative usages of start sites and cryptic splice sites. However, if methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted, The chromosomes can be easily recombined or rearranged to produce insertions or deletions which lead to overexpression of oncogenes or deletion of tumor suppressors. In addition, hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements increases the possibility of DNA transposition and enhanced activity of promoter sequences from repetitive elements. These both results in reduced integrity of genome and finally lead to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) of paternal allele is hypomethylated so the CTCF, an insulator protein can not bind ICR to insulate the action from distal enhancer on igf2 locus, a growth related genes. Methylation of ICR also spreads to H19, a gene downstream of ICR, to inactivate its expression. These results in activation of growth signal in the cells. On the contrary, the ICR of maternal allele is hypermethylated and there is no methylation on H19 promoter, so the CTCF binds to ICR and H19 is expressed. Distal enhancer can not act on upstream igf2 locus so the growth signal is inhibited. In Wilm’s tumor, the ICR of maternal allele is hypermethylated so CTCF no longer binds to ICR, so the enhancer on maternal allele can act like the one on paternal allele which results in the activation of igf2 locus on maternal allele; Therefore, both igf2 locus are activated so growth signal is enhanced leading to overproliferation and tumor in kidney. In addition to Wilm’s tumor, the loss of imprinting from maternal allele leads to fatal and post-natal overgrowth and Macroglossia due to loss of Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressor element, and enhanced expression of igf2.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug belongs to inhibitors of DNA methyl transferase (DNMTi) based on its effect on demethylating DNA. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue so it can incorporate into DNA while DNA replication. DNA methyl transferase binds incorporated Decitabine irreversibly and loss of its activity to further methylate on daughter strand. Due to the nature of incorporation mechanism, Decitabine targets cancer cells which have higher cell proliferation and DNA replication rate than normal cells in anti-tumor therapies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs have sustained effects due to their effects can pass on to the proginies of cells. However, the cautions need to be taken to use in the sensitive periods, when epigenenetics plays important roles and will affect the outcome of development. Especially during the elimination of previous epigenetic mark from parents and reset new marks during development of early embryos and primodial germ line cell development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods should be in extra caution because these epigenetic drugs may affect development, differentiation and growth of embryos,  and the effects will be passed on to daughter cells.</p>
