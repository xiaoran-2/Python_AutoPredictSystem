    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal non-cancer cells, the CpG di-nucleotides at the promoters of a gene are generally unmethylated and this may or may not suppress the expression of that gene. In cancer, this goes awry and there is DNA hyper-methylation at the CpG islands of genes especially tumour suppressor genes, thereby silencing them. Hence the cells divide rapidly and don’t die out, leading to the formation of tumours and hence cancer. Also, in non-cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the gene are methylated. Methylation of the intergenic regions provides genome stability by preventing the translocation, deletion, insertion and illegitimate recombination of chromosomes. The methylation of  repetitive elements  silences them and hence the repeats cannot translocate or recombine, which would then cause mutations of the gene. In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and the repeats are unmethylated or hypomethylated , which cause mutations of the gene. The genome becomes unstable and the repeats too are active, jumping around and copy-pasting themselves at random locations of the gene and this is mutagenic and leads to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster,chromosomes are paternally imprinted. It consists of the Igf2 gene, the ICR, the H19 gene and the enhancers (upstream direction). In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF protein binds to the ICR. This CTCF insulates Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers turn to and enhance the expression of H19. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and the CTCF protein cannot bind to it. Now the enhancers are free to enhance the expression of their preferred gene, Igf2. The H19 gene in the paternal allele is methylated at the CpG islands, due to the spreading of DNA methylation from the ICR region and the H19 gene is silenced. In short, in the paternal allele, there is the expression of Igf2 and of H19 on the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, there is a general loss of imprinting due to a mutation or paternal uni-parental disomy or an epigenetic loss of imprinting and hence DNA methylation at the ICR of the maternal allele. This leads to both alleles behaving like the paternal allele and both expressing Igf2. This up-regulation of Igf2, an oncogene,leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine sold as Dacogen is a DNA-demethylating agent or a DNMTi ( DNA Methyl Transferase) -inhibitor ( an epigenetic drug) and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication and binds irreversibly to DNMT, which maintains the DNA methylation marks in daughter cells. As cancer cells divide and proliferate rapidly, they are severely affected by the drug. Hence decitabine can prevent hyper-methylation of tumour suppressors, one of the leading cancer mechanisms. These tumour suppressors are now active enough to prevent the proliferation of cells and hence cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin’s speculation that the epigenetic drugs has a lasting effect on the tumour cells that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy is quite possible as epigenetic changes are passed on during mitosis to daughter cells until they are actively erased. For ex: we know that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to the maintenance of methylation by DNMT. Hence epigenetic therapies can affect changes which stop a cancer growing without killing its cells. Sensitive periods are the periods during which epigenetic marks are laid down or removed by enzymes (epigenetic reprogramming). In human beings, these sensitive periods occur during pre-implantation period of the embryo and during primordial germ cell development. If the drugs are administered to young patients during these periods, these epigenetic drugs might alter the entire enzymatic machinery and affect all other tissues as well. Hence, it is very important to administer these drugs at appropriate times of development and age.</p></div>
