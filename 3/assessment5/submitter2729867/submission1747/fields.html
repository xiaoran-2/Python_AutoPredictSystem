    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">At present there are known different types of DNA methylation: locus specific DNA hypermethylation in CpG islands and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which might occur in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Normal cells usually differ from cancer cells in the methylation patterns. In fact, whereas CpG islands are hypomethylated in normal cells, in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, but this does not mean that every cell is methylated. The ones that are more likely to be hypermethylated are promotors of tumor suppressor genes and this causes silencing of the expression of these genes. The tumor supressors play an important role in protecting cells from cancer. So in the absence of these protectors cell growth is promoted.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The other type of methylation is the methylation that usually occurs in normal cells: the ones in the repetitive elements or intergenic regions. These methylations help to maintain the genomic stability due to the inactivation of repeats and condensation of heterochromatin. However, in cancer cells the cells are more likely to be hypomethylated, triggering genomic instability. This happens because as the chromatin is less condensed, it is more accessible and changes might occur, allowing translocation of repetitive elements for example, which disrupts the genes where DNA fragments are translocated.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In general, DNA methylation patterns differ between different types of cancer. Therefore, whereas some type of cancer might be caused by CgG islands hypermethylation, among other things, in other type of cancer the main alterations are  repetitive elements and intergenic regions hypomethylation. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 imprint works blocking the enhancers that promotes the expression of different RNAs differently in maternal and paternal alleles. In this cluster we can find both Igf2 and H19 alleles and CTCF binding site (a protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). There is also an Imprinted Control Region (ICR) that can be methylated.</p>
<p>On the <strong>paternal allele</strong> the ICR is methylated. As this region is methylated, the CTCF insulator protein cannot bind and, hence, there is no insulator action so that the enhancers will <strong>promote de expression of Igf2</strong> in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, the ICR is unmethylated and the protein CTCF bounds to its binding site. Therefore, CTCF is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancer will promote H19 expression, but <strong>Igf2 will be silent</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong>, there is a loss of imprinting and, therefore, in both maternal and paternal alleles the ICRs are hypermethilated, and so, the expression of Ifg2 will be promoted in both cases.</p>
<p>So in Wilm’s tumour it will be <strong>double dose of Igf2</strong>. As Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone, this hypermetilation will lead to tumor genesis in very early stages.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In each stage of development DNA methylation levels should be strictly regulated to allow the correct development. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to next generation’s cells. So we can erase some epigenetic marks in order to avoid a disease but this will endure for a long time until the reprogramming is carried out again.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is referred to the period when epigenetic reprogramming happens, in other words, periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, and therefore, it is a period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals.</p>
<p>It is known that there are two ways of reprogramming that occur during <strong>germ cell development</strong> and during <strong>early development</strong>. Both are very sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming, and there is also the time when ICSI or IVF are carried out, and therefore, the development during these stages might be disrupted.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because they may affect both the germ cell development and early development. Furthermore, they may become more susceptible to other external factors, and it does not last just until the treatment provision ends, but also afterwards, settling a big risk against epigenetic changes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor created to treat myeodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. As it is a nucleoside analog, during the replication it binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransfere. So this process occurs only when cell division is carried out. As cancer cells divide in a higher rate than normal cells, this affects cancer cells in a more direct way, so, it can be said that this treatment is “specific” to the damaged cells.  </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Recently, it has been found that Decitabine in low dose shows a great anti-tumoral effect killing tumor cells. But as cancer is a very complex disease we can be sure that DNA demthylation is the only mechanism that causes this cancer. Hence, it is unknown which are the long term effects in normal cells.</span></p></div>
