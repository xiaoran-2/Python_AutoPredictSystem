    <div class="field-value"><p>The human genome represents a “codebook” of genes, however, different cells require different expression of these genes. This is achieved by epigenetic modification of the genome, to regulate DNA transcription. One of these modifications is methylation of CpG islands. CpG islands are regions of DNA where CpG dinucleotides are particularly dense, and are commonly found in promotor regions of DNA. Methylation of the cytosine residues of CpG islands can result in transcriptionally silent genes. This occurs normally in certain circumstances such as X-chromasome inactivation or imprinted genes, but in the healthy genome CpG islands in promoter regions are largely non-methylated.</p>
<p>Disruption of CpG island methylation can lead to aberrant regulation of gene expression. In cancer,  in which cells divide rapidly and uncontrollably, it appears there is genome-wide loss of methylation. This leads to de-repression of gene expression, but some specific sites show increased methylation – particularly sites coding for tumor suppressor genes such as p53. This increase in CpG island methylation removes some of the natural protection of the normal cell cycle.</p>
<p>Methylation is not limited to CpG islands, but also occurs in CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Here CpG’s normally tend to be methylated, leading to an increase in genomic stability. Intergenic regions can have gene promoters that interfere with normal transcription (cryptic splice sites) – resulting in transcriptional interference and formation of incomplete mRNA for a protein. Repetitive elements (RE’s) can cause genomic instability by moving position or replicating in the genome. Both intergenic regions and RE’s are usually methylated, preventing a loss of genome stability. In cancer these regions can become hypomethylated, resulting in DNA mutations.</p>
<p>The end result of altered DNA methylation in cancer is a a loss in control of DNA transcription, an increase in silencing of regulatory transcriptional repressor proteins and increase in genome instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene represents an example of an imprinted gene. Normally, a person has a maternal and paternal copy of the Igf2 gene, however the maternal copy is silenced and only the paternal copy expressed (monoallelic expression). This impriniting is regulated by allele-specific methylation pattern of the imprinting control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster. The ICR on the maternal allele is not methylated, allowing the transcriptional regulator CTCF to bind to it and silence expression of Igf2, preferentially expressing the long non-coding RNA H19 instead. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, meaning that CTCF cannot bind to it to repress Igf2 expression, and thus Igf2 is preferentially expressed from the paternal allele. In addition, the H19 allele is also methylated, inhibiting it’s transcription.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, imprinting of the Igf2 gene is lost when the maternal allele also becomes methylated. This leads to expression of Igf2 from both the paternal and maternal genome – a pathological situation as the IGF2 protein is a growth factor, promoting cell division – thus when it is improperly regulated (as is the case when it is no longer imprinted in the maternal allele) cell growth and division is promoted beyond normal levels.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which targets the DNA methyltransferase 1 enzymes to prevent methylation of DNA. Decitabine is an analog of cytosine that can be incorporated into DNA when the cell divides. As DNMT1 acts to methylate cytosine residues, if it instead encounters decitabine (5-aza-2’-deoxycytosine) it is irreversibly bound to it and thus unable to methylate further cytosine residues. This eventually leads to a loss of methylation that is dependent on cell division. This means it has a more pronounced effect on tumour cells, which divide much more rapidly than normal cells. However, this effect is not specific to tumour cells only, and the long term effects of DNMTi use on normal cells are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation in cancer typically occurs in tumour suppressor genes, silencing their ability to regulate cell division and development. Chemically targeting and removing this hypermethylation could allow for these tumour suppressor genes to be reactivated and perform their protective role.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable as cells divide. This means that any agents used to manipulate DNA methylation can have effects which outlast the drug treatment period, as the changes in methylation patter are expressed by future generations of cells after the initial event. However, agents which alter DNA methylation may have consequences when used in times that the genome is particularly sensitive to epigenetic modifications, or sensitive periods. During these times, there is active remodelling of the epigenome, and these are typically during development of primordial germ cells to gametes, and then post-fertilization during the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. At these times, epigenetic marks are removed and re-added and changes in the environment can have marked effects on the epigenome. After these markers are established, they are mostly maintained during mitotic division – there is still the possibility to modify the epigenome after these sensitive periods, but it is less likely to occur. It also means that irregular epigenetic marks established during sensitive periods will also be maintained rather than corrected, and this may have deleterious effects on the cell phenotype. Thus treating with an agent that alters the methylation status of genes during sensitive periods may end up causing widespread silencing and/or activation of genes that would normally be repressed in the cell.</p></div>
