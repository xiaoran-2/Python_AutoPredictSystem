    <h1>Submission 960 from Anon (session_user_id: 667c40ac3cfb5b5e804fb0f6f327058840f33afc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. A DNA methyltranferase inhibitor (DNMT1).  Enzymatic epigenetic regulators. Drugs which target the epigentic machinery.</p>
<p>Used in cancer on Myleodysplastic syndrome which has progressed to AML. They were found in Dr Baylins study to alter the tumour cells in some lasting way to make them more susceptiple to chemotherapy. At very low doses a very good anti-neoplastic affect; that is killing tumour cells. MDS is dependent on hypermethylated CpG islands.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a  nuceloscide analogues. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication and then when the DNMT1 come along  to bind that nucleotide to copy that DNA methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT1 is bound irreversably and it cannot be released.</p>
<p>The action of the DNMT1 is division dependent, you have to have the cell replicating; cancer cells which are dividing more rapidly in the cell will be more severely affected because they are replicating more.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very staple epigenetic mark which is passed on to subsequent cell generations reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization typically.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and grand-daughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the methylation programming and deprogramming is taking place, in early embryo development. With younger patients the effects on germ cells needs to be considered. Inhibiting the epigenetic machinery with environmental damage will be damaging also.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods will possibly have a damaging effect on the germ cells of young people. There is evidence that generations later the damaging effects of the environment will affect the grandchildren in a way which is due to the environment the parents experienced. E.g. Grandchildren of granparents who had abundant food will have a higher risk of diabetes. Similarily drug therapy during sensitive periods of a persons lifetime will have a generational effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the reasoning behind epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation of promoter regions is present then gene expression is not present. In a normal cell CpG islands are not  DNA methylated; they are hypomethylated. The introns of genes are methylated as are the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable locking down the epigenetic silencing/activation of genes.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell the CpG islands are hypermethylated they are found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. The introns of genes and the repetive elements and the intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The outcome of CpG island hypermethylation is to silence tumour suppressor genes. This is one of many insults usually sufficient to cause cancer as per Knudsens hypothesis. Epimutations are rapidly selected.</p>
<p>Global hypomethylation has been implicated in the development and the progression of cancer through many mechanisms.</p>
<p>Another cancer causing CpG island hypermethylation is CIMP. Where whole sets of genes are affected e.g. colorectal cancer or glioma. The cancer phenotype is caused by (CpG islands in particular) sets of genes being hypermethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele when it is methylated CTFC does not bind to it so the enhancers work on Igf2 instead,H19 is not expressed. CTFC binds to the maternal allele meanwhile and the enhancers work on H19 and Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>WIth loss of imprinting there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region of the maternal allele and CTFC does not bind to it and the enhancers work on Igf2 instead as well with H19 not expressed. So now there is a double dose of Igf2 in the cancer cell in comparison to the normal cell.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoting which is associated with Wilms tumour. Imprinting has been disrupted in the maternal allele and this is consequently the reason for double Igf2 and Wilms tumour.</p>
<p>Noteworthy is that DNA methylation is context dependent. Different tumours have different dependencies. Driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumourigenesis. Driven by chromosomal instability then depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumourigenesis.</p></div>
