    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation is silencing of gene expression by forming a repressive chromatin structure and prohibiting transcription factors binding. In normal cells, CpG islands is usually unmethylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands seem to be hepermethylated which is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes contributes to disease since it removes cells growth limiter and makes cells grow uncontrollably. </p>
<p>Other locations of DNA methylation are at the intragenic regions and repetitive elements which usually methylated in the normal cells to repress transcription noise and prevent transposition of these genes. But in the cancer cells, these location are speculated hypomethylated. Hypomethylation of intragenic regions and repetitive elements can bring about genomic or chromosomal instability, so tumorigenesis is enhanced. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration in DNA methylation at imprinting control regions (ICRs) either hypomethylation or hypermethylation can bring about cancer by overexpression of growth promoting genes and loss of growth suppression genes.</p>
<p>This is the example of the H19/Igf12 cluster on chromosome 11 which can be disrupted and contributes to Wilm's tumour.</p>
<p>In the normal paternal allele, the ICR has been methylated. Methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF (an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers). Without CTCF, DNA methylation will spread to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can activate Igf2.</p>
<p>In the normal maternal allele, the ICR has been unmethylated, so CTCF can bind the ICR and insulate Igf2 which cause Igf2 silencing. And due to there is no DNA methylation spread to H19, H19 is activated. </p>
<p>But in the Wilm's tumour disease, maternal allele has been disrupted by DNA methylation at the ICR. Hyperethylation at maternal ICR causes maternal allele similar to paternal allele and overexpressing of Igf2 which is one of the growth factor, therefore the cells will grow rapidly and uncontrollably. Furthermore, there is no expression of H19 gene, so polypoidization will be increased. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Nowadays, there are many cancer drugs that affect epigenetic processes for example A<span>zacitidine and Decitabine.</span></p>
<p>Azacitidine and Decitabine is the DNA methyltranferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferases after they are consolidated into DNA. They act by knocked-down the DNA methylation after DNA has been replicated. So, both Azacitidine and Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing hypermethylated DNA in the tumour cells. However, these drugs would be inefficient in some tumors that cause by DNA hypomethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs may have effects last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) can pass to daughter cell. Once drugs changed epigenetic of cancer cells like erasing DNA methylation, the epigenetic of next generation will be changed in every daughter cell.</p>
<p>However, epigenetic drugs might have been strictly considered when use with patient in a sensitive period (<span>a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms such as early development and young patient</span>) because effects of the drugs would disrupt the regulatory of epigenetic mechanism in germ line cells.</p>
