    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell you see hypomethylation at CpG island. The genome is methylated in the repetative elements through the intergenic region and also in the introns of genes. In a cancer cell the CpG island is more likely to be methylated (Hypermethylation), while the rest of the genome (repetavie elements, intergenic region and introns) are hypomethylated, which means less or no methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypermethylaton at the CpG island progresses with time, causes inactivation of tumour surppresion genes, which prolongs cell life and increases growth of the cell, which can cause a cancerous cell. Some examples of hypermethylation of single genes that cause cancer are, RB in retinoblasma, BRCA1 in breast cancer, MLH1 in colorectal cancer and MGMT in gilomas and colorectal tumors. You can also have hypermethylation of a set of genes (CIMP). These hypermethylated CpG islands differ by tumor type.</p>
<p>Genome-wide (including intergenic regions/repetitive elements)  DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability. This can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This genomic instability can lead to an abnormal deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations in the karyotype.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Most imprinting genes are involved in growth, either growth promoting or growth surpressing. You can have either hypo- or hyper-methylation of imprinted genes.</p>
<p>In a normal cell the paternal allele imprint control region (ICR) is methylated while the maternal is not. When it is unmethylated, CTCF will bind to the ICR on the maternal allele, therefore the enhancers will act on H19, and the lgf2 will remain silent on this allele(no expression). On the ICR methylated paternal allele the enhancers can act on lgf2, because CTCF is not binding to the ICR.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With Wilm's tumour, you have hypermethylation so that both the paternal and maternal alleles are methylated at the ICR site. Now you get a double dose of lgf2 because the enhancers on the maternal alle are not forced to act on H19 rather than lgf2. lgf2 is growth promoting which is way this imprinting error can contribute to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating (hypomethylating) agent which is used to treat<span> myelodysplastic syndromes which is a precursor of acute <span>myelogenous</span> leukaemia. This enzymatic epigentic regulator removes or decreases methylation. It <span>helps make bone marrow produce normal blood cells and also acts by killing abnormal cells that have grown in the bone marrow. It is a nucleloside analogue that is replication (or division) dependent because it irreversibly binds DNMTs  after they're incorporated into DNA so that DNMT can no longer be released. At low doses, Decitabine kills tumor cells because its DNA demethylation has a anti-neoplastic effect. It may be acting on the hypermethylation at CpG islands associated with myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs can make changes to DNA that are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are permenantly erased. So without having to kill the cell, epigentic drugs may stop the cells from replicating abnormally, which can cause cancer. </span></p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigentic remodelling. These periods of laying out epigentic marks are very suseptable to changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Primordial germ cell development through to the production of mature eggs and sperms is the first sensitive period and preimplantation and early post implantation period is another. These are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome. </p>
<p>If treatment is given during a sensitive period it could have a lasting disruption of the epigenome that may even be passed on through the generations. It may disrupt cruicial formation or make the patient suseptible to disease in the future.</p></div>
