    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, which represents the attachment of a methyl group to the 5' carbon atom of the Cytosine base, is found in CpG dinucleotides.</p>
<p>There are clusters of CpG dinucleotides known as CpG islands spread throughout the genome, which are often at promoters of genes. In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, since methylation is normally related with gene silencing, that is because the presence of methylated CpG (<sup>me</sup>CpG) in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (more condense chromatin).</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG Islands (CGI) hypermethylation is found. Specifically, hypermethylation is associated with CGI located in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressor genes are growth restriction genes, so when hypermethylation is found in their promoters, they cannot be expressed anymore. Accordingly, growth of the cell will be deregulated (higher development rate), and it may lead to the development of malignancies.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation (even more frequent), and in fact, it is recognised as one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.</p>
<p>Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually genome-wide methylated in normal cells, which contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity, (silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent illegitimate recombination).</p>
<p>In tumour cells, genome-wide hypomethylation is found, and it includes the repetitive elements and intergenic regions, such feature of cancer cells was the first described and it is maintained (to some degree) in all tumour types.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements may produce genomic instability, that can trigger illegitimate recombination between repeats, as well as their activation and transposition, and even the activation of cryptic promoters (as was shown for the A<sup>vy</sup> allele).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes exist in clusters, and each cluster has its own ICR (Imprinted Control Region).</p>
<p>In normal cells, paternal allele ICR methylation is found, which blocks binding of CTCF (insulator protein), methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence, and enhancers can access <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Igf2 to active</span>. In contrast, maternal allele ICR is unmethylated, thus enabling binding of CTCF, which is an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Igf2 now not expressed</span>), and hence the enhancers act on the H19 (allowing H19 expression).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour (a childhood kidney tumour), <span style="text-decoration:underline;">methylation in the maternal ICR is detected</span>, this lead to Igf2 overexpression (due to the fact that now we will have double dose of active Igf2).</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene, thus its overexpression can lead to uncontrolled growth and development of hyperplasia and malignancies.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, which is one of the FDA approved epigenetic drugs, belongs to the DNMTi class, (DNA MethylTransferase inhibitors).</p>
<p>DNA methylation is laid down by DNMT enzymes, which can be classified in <em>de novo</em> methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals) and maintaining methyltransferases (DNMT1).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, thus it can be incorporated into DNA along the replication process. After that, these nucleoside analogues (now in the DNA strand) irreversibly bind DNMTs when enzymes arrive to perform its function. Because of this, DNMTs can no longer do its job, thus DNA hypomethylation will occur.</p>
<p>It is probably that since many tumours are caused by hypermethylation in tumour suppressor genes, treatment with decitabine as a "hypomethylation agent" can allow the reactivation of these tumour suppressor genes and hence have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The reason why DNA methylation modifications can still be effective beyond the period of drug treatmente is that they are mitotically heritable. This means that DNA methylation (as well as other epigenetic changes) is passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Maintenance DNA methylation is performed by DNMT1, (the maintaining methyltransferase).</p>
<p>Sensitive period could be defined as a period when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control, and it coincides with the same moments when epigenetic reprogramming takes place.</p>
<p>The two main sensitive periods in the development correspond to early embryonic development and PGC (primordial germ cells) development. Both are sensitive periods because there is a genome-wide (with exceptions such as IAPs) clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>If we treat patients with these above-mentioned epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods we can alter their epigenetic state maybe for the rest of their lives. Such alterations can cause a huge variety of disorders, particularly aberrant imprinting, which can lead to, unfortunately, a large number of diseases. </p></div>
