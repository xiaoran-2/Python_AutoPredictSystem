    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Dacogen,  Decitabine (azacitidine) is an epigenetic inhibitor that belong to the aza-nucleosides and histone deacetylase inhibitors and is the same as other drugs like Vidaza. This drugs act over some cancers, e.g.  lung cancer, myelogenous leukaemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.</p>
<p>The impact of azacitidine over methylation is the rapid loss of DNA methyl transferase activity (Dnmt1)  because a bound of azacitidine to DNA and this bound is irreversible, the Decitabine joint to CpG instead of Dnmt1 and then, the passively loss of methylation take place.  Some studies demostrate a relationship between methylation and cancer because a lower level of methylated citosine in DNA of the tumour cells compared with normale cells so the  anti tumour effect of the Decitabine is can be applied in the reductuin of the hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor supressor genes and hence the reactivation of the gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation is the basis of different epigenetic phenomena like imprinting or X chromosome inactivation. The DNA methylation of the promoter regions are correlate inversely with gene expression  but the CpG islands are an exception. This CpG island are found in 60% of promoters with high density and usually kept free of methylation. <span>CpG islands are associate with more than 75% of all known transcription start sites</span><span> and with 88% of active promoters identified in primary fibroblast</span><span>, indicating that they bear important regulatory functions. They are hot spots of specific histone modifications</span><span>, they frequently bind ubiquitous transcription factors</span><span>, and they exhibit particularly accessible chromatin structures</span><span>. For these reasons, CpG islands have become indispensable for genome analysis and annotation. They play a fundamental role for promoter prediction</span><span>, and their use as candidate regions for aberrant DNA methylation has contributed significantly to our understanding of the epigenetic causes of cancer</span><span>. Transcriptional inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes by promoter CpG island methylation is thought to be an important mechanism in human carcinogenesis. A number of tumor-suppressor genes, such as CDKN2A (p16/INK4A), MGMT, and MLH1, have been shown to be silenced by promoter methylation in colorectal carcinoma, for example. Another case is the </span>methylation of 5’ CpG islands is thought to play an important role in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in gastric cancer associated with the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP).  In healthy cells, CpG islands are generally hypomethylated. This allows for an open chromatin structure. However, the CpG poor regions found in repetitive elements within the intergenic and intronic regions of the genome are methylated and thereby maintain a closed chromatin structure. In cancer and on the inactive X chromosome many CpG islands become methylated, forcing these regions into a closed chromatin structure. When CpG islands located within promoters are methylated,the corresponding genes are persistently silenced. In contrast,the CpG poor regions become hypomethylated allowing for an open chromatin structure.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="text-align:left;">The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is ruled by a CTCF (dependent insulator that is located between the genes). On maternal allele, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the imprinting control region, generating an insulator that prevents IGF2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the imprinting control region not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing IGF2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19. The <span>mechanism of imprinting uses a long non-coding RNA</span>. Aberrant imprinting of the Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of Wilms tumour that is associated of hypometilation of specific differentially methylated regions located 5' to the main IGF2 promoters (DMR0) . <span>In normal individuals, </span><span>IGF2 </span><span>expression is from the paternal allele and </span><span>H19 </span><span>is from the maternal allele. </span>imprinting control region <span>and DMR0 are methylated on the paternal chromosome.<span>In the Wilms tumour, </span><span>IGF2 </span><span>activation and </span><span>H19 </span><span>silencing are associated with disruption of both maternal and paternal somat ic loss of imprints.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA is covalently modified by DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs), which transfer a methyl  group from the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to the cytosine ring. The resulting carbon-carbon bond is a stable epigenetic mark classically associated with gene silencing . DNA methylation patterns are commonly established during early embryonic development [and maintained by DNMTs. DNA methylation is implicated in cases where highly stable programming of gene expression is established in early life. There are periods during postnatal development in which for example, the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan. It is through this so-called programming effect on the CNS that early-life experiences are thought to confer either risk or resilience regarding later psychopathology. The period of avoidance such drugs are the two periods of reseting the epigenetic marks like clearing epigenetic marks in germ cell development and early embrionic development. Also in the genomic imprinting period may alter the genetic expression of both parents in the progenie.</p></div>
