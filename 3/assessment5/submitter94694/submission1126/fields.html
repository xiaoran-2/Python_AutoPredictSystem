    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The regulation of DNA methylation is required for normal cell development and death. The function of DNA methylation is to silence a gene by preventing the transcription machinery to bind to its promoter, these gene promoters are mostly located in CpG islands. In cancer, generally speaking, the CpG islands are hypomethylated. Cancer development is promoted by expression of an oncogene by hypomethylation of its CpG islands or by silencing tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation of its CpG islands. Another anomaly that occurs in cancer is its expression of repetitive elements and intergenic regions, by hypomethylation. These repetitive elements must be methylated and thus, silenced. Some repetitive elements contribute to copying and pasting themselves in different parts of the genome, this way altering the human genome, and developing cancerous cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents. Like the name suggests it reduces de methylation of the DNA, this mechanism may me important in certain cancers that are distinguished because of hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes; cancers like myelodisplatic syndromes, which are precursors to acute myelogeneous leukemia. By demethylating these tumor suppressor genes we, in a certain way, give the ability to the cells to reduce the activity of oncogenes.</p></div>
