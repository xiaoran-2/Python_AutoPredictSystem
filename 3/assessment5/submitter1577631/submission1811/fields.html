    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are generally not methylated, while areas such as the introns of genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. However, in cancer, a global decrease in methylation in seen, whereas the CpG islands become hypermethylated and their 2kb shores also show an increase in methylation.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of CpG islands leads to disease because it can result in tumour repressor genes being deactivated, allowing tumours to develop.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also lead to cancer. This can be due to illegitimate recombination of repeats because their identities become similar or identical to other parts of the genome, activation of repeats of transpositions, or the activation of cryptic promoters and the ensuing disruption to surrounding genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As explained in Q1, changes to the methylation of the genome can be caused as a result of a genetic or epigenetic change that will result in cancer. When the changes in DNA methylation happen at ICRs (imprinting control regions), a loss of expression of growth restricting genes can occur.</p>
<p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele's ICR is normally methylated. This results in the downstream enhancers acting on Igf2, while H19 is deactivated. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it. This results in the enhancers acting on H19, and Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>However, in cancer, hypermethylation of the maternal allele means that its ICR is also methylated and it acts just like the paternal allele - Igf2 is expressed, while H19 is not. This double-dose of Igf2 (a growth promoter) results in a cancer of the kidneys called Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA-approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It acts as an analogue to a nucleoside, meaning that it gets incorporated into the DNA during replication. It binds DNMTs to itself irreversibly, so the DNMTs cannot be used, meaning that methylation is inhibited, which may result in cell death (much as a lack of DNMT1 in mouse embryos will lead to death mid-term). Because this process is dependent on cell replication, it is particularly effective on cancer cells because they replicate rapidly, meaning that it kills off tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations to the DNA methylation of a genome can have lasting effects on the epigenome. This is because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, due to the presence of DNA methyltransferases, which ensure that methylation is preserved in the two daughter cells during mitosis. Any changes that have been made through drug treatment will be preserved and may have further side-effects.</p>
<p>Particular care should be taken when considering administering epigenetically modifying drugs during what are known as sensitive periods, during which transgenerational epigenetic effects may occur. These sensitive areas are, in particular, when a mother is pregnant, as changes to her will also affect her baby and the baby's primordial germ cells, and in young people, as their primordial germ cells will still be developing. Treating patients during the sensitive periods is inadvisable since any (potentially harmful) epigenetic effects of the drugs will also be applied to one or more further generations.</p></div>
