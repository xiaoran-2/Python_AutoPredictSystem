    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoter of a gene is associated with gene silencing. The promoter with these marks can be bound by proteins e.g MeCP1&amp;2 which can recruit other factors that condense the chromatin or altogether meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding and alter gene expression.</p>
<p>Cancer is associated with genomewide hypomethylation and locus specific hypermethylation.</p>
<p>While the local specific sites are hypermethylated the function of DNA methylation is context dependent in ways it may enhance growth promoter genes by erasure of methylation marks or may silence growth suppressor genes by heavily methylating on the promoters, thus contributing to disease.</p>
<p>Methylation in intergenic regions causes silencing of cryptic transcription start sites(TSS) or cryptic splice sites. Methylation on the repetitive elements causes silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, prevent illegal transposition, prevent illegitimate recombination. Genome defense model states that DNA methylation is mutagenic (meC-&gt;T) so must also be a benefit i.e protect the genome from transposable elements. Silencing of these elements contributes to genomic integrity.</p>
<p>Enzymes/proteins that are involved in laying down, removing and reading the methylation marks are mutated in cancer cells. These mutations could begin as stochastic alterations which are then mitotically inherited by daughter cells, thus contributing to the accumulation of aberations with age. Additionally these mutated genes can translocate, amplify themselves, lead to CpG hypermethylation, and point mutated contributing to more epigenetic mistakes.</p>
<p>Intergenic and repetitive elements are hypomethylated with tumerogenicity. As a consequence the cryptic TSS and the splice sites within intergenic elements become available for the transcription of the antisense DNA strand or cause copying errors which might be insertions, deletions, or reciprocal translocations. Similarly removing marks on the repetitive elements might cause transpositions, transcriptional interference from strong promoters or illegitimate recombination. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. The CTCF insulator cannot bind on the ICR when it is methylated. So the enhancers can directly act on the Igf2 gene driving its expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. Now the CTCF insulator can bind at the ICR blocking the action of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene. So the enhancers act on the H19 gene.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICRs in cancer cells can result in the methylation at ICRs in both the parental alleles and the methylation is spread into nearby promoter region of H19 gene thereby silencing it. H19 gene is silenced in both the alleles and Igf2 gene is activated in both the alleles, thus disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>CTCF insulator cannot bind at the ICR in the maternal allele, so both the alleles look identical. Enhancers can now act directly on the Igf2 genes in both alleles hence overexpressing the Igf2 gene by two fold. Overexpression of Igf2 causes Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly bind DNA methyl transferases after they are incorporated into DNA. Then onwards it inhibits the laying of methylation marks on the DNA. Since the DNMTs act on hemimethylated DNA to laydown methylation marks on both the DNA strands, they are involved in the maintainence of the methylation during cell replication.  Therefore the drug is replication dependent.</p>
<p>Cancer cells divide most rapidly than any other cells in the body  so demethylation is more effective in cancer cells than any other cells. CpG island hypomethylation is favorable in certain type of cancer called as the myodisplastic syndrome. In some cases of this cancer Decitabine is known to kill tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (e.g by transcription factors) DNA methylation changes are mitotically heritable i.e. they can be passed on to daughter cells and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased, with eternity. Thus <span>altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. </span>So if we consider the cancer cells, they can be cured eventually without having to kill all the cancer cells. This could explain, why some patients showed favorable outcome with chemotheraphy after being treated with the epigenetic drug. A sensitive period can be defined as the time period during which major and most of epigenetic changes occur, in the context of the developmental cycle of a human. These sensitive periods occur during the resetting and setting of methylation marks in early development and primordial germ cell development. The drug might interfere with the developmental processess if the drug is administered during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
