    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">In a normal cell we expect to find a hypomethylated CpG island. But despite this we find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes as. Cancer cells are the exact opposite of this so instead we find CpG islands that while not always methylated are more likely to be methylated than a  normal cell.  In cancer cells the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns are hypomethylated.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">DNA methylation in CpG islands is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. In fact it is not uncommone to find epigenetic mutations alongside genetic mutations. An example of such would be explained by the two hit Knudson hypothesis wherein the second copy of the gene (RB1, MLH1, BRACA1, etc.) can be knocked out by an epigenetic mutation leading to cancer. This is moreso a concern becasue while epigenetics is mitotically heritable it is also reversible, thus giving rise to host of new treatment options not applicable to genetic mutations. Given that different cancers come up with different patterns of hypermethylation, these are now being used for diagnostic, prognostic and even treatment options.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">Again in normal cells we generally see methylation in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. In cancer we see the opposite and find that their intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">In human models dnmt3b was found to contribute to ICF syndrome. This is because hypomethylation of these regions causes genomic instability through the llegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Thus in the hypomethylated cancer cell we see more translocations, insertions and deletions. </div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine is a drug used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It functions by hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferease.</p>
<p>Decitabine are nuceloside analogues that irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. Thus a replication dependent drug. Although the exact mechanism of action is uknown it has been foudn to be especially effective on hematologic malignancies, as these types of cancers are dependent on tumor supprerssor gene hypermethylation. With the binding of DNMT decitabine reduces the methylation allowing the tumor suppressor gene to function again.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known to be methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. In a unmethylated maternal allele CTCF works as an insulator and redirecting the enhancers to bind to H19 thus silencing Igf2 in the maternal allele. But because the paternal allele is methylated and CTCF is nto present, the enhancers can directly act on IGF2 resulting in IGF2 expression in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>This imprinting pattern however can be disrupted when  we have hypermethylation in the imprint control region on the maternal allele. In efffect this will lead to maternal expression of IGF2, resulting in doubling the dose of IGF2 when compared to the normal cell. THis is the mutation often found in Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.<br /><br />The abnormal expression of IGF2 contributes to the disease because it is growth promoting, allowing the tumor to proliferate in the absence of growth signals. This is in fact one of the hallmarks of cnacer. Moreover loss of imprinting often occurs as a very early event in preneoplastic tissues. This suggests that events at imprint control regions may be very early events in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">It is widely known that epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, meaning that it can be passed on from cell to cell and allowed to proliferate for effectively the whole life time of an organism. There are numerous epigenetic machineries that will that allow this including DNMT, HAT, HDACS, etc. Although less explored and understood it is postulated that epigenetics may also display germ cell heritability.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<div dir="ltr">Sensitive periods are marked by period wherein the resetting of epigenetic marks are done. It is termed sensitive as it is during this period that the genome is susceptible to acquiring errors that may ulitmately lead to termination of pregnancy or genetic mutations such such as Angelmans and Prader-Willi syndrome. These periods are early development and germ cell formation.</div>
<div dir="ltr"> </div>
<p>Because during these periods major changes and in epigenetic machinery are being made it is not unlikely that epigenetic therapy may alter and adversely affect the clearing of marks. This is especially dangerous in younger patients still undergoing germ cell formation as epigenetic changes can be passed through the germ cell. Treatment during sensitive periods is also likely to lead to exagerrated responses that we don't normally expect in other periods. </p></div>
