    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing. Most promoter regions have CpG islands, which are normally unmethylated. Methylation of CpG islands can prevent transcription factors from binding or promote the condensation of chromatin by recruiting proteins like MeCP1 or MeCP2. In cancer CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, especially at tumour suppressor genes while in normal cells, these CpG islands are usually unmethlyated. Tumour suppressor genes encode proteins that regulate the cell cycle, programmed cell death (apoptosis) or DNA repair. If these genes are silenced, the cell cycle ceases to be regulated and cells survive beyond their normal lifespan, contributing to the undifferentiated, immortal phenotype of cancer cells. Suppression of DNA repair enzymes helps the cancer cells to accumulate mutations, which promotes disease progression.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and this prevents deletions, translocations, insertions, activation of cryptic transcription start sites or splice sites or illegitimate recombination. In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is often absent. This can allow the alignment of regions between chromosomes to occur and illegitimate recombination. Repeats can start causing transcriptional aberrations in surrounding regions. This causes a general increase in genomic instability that contributes to disease by altering gene expression. For example, in mice with tissue-specific deletion of Dnmt1, cancer results because genomic instability causes activation of oncogenes and silencing of tumour suppressors. Loss of methylation at intergenic regions and repeats can therefore promote genome instability and promote disease progression by enhancing tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>However, the exact contribution of DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands or hypomethylation of intergenic regions/repeats depends on the exact type and stage of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind. The methylation spreads to the H19 promoter's CpG islands. Without CTCF binding, the downstream enhancers act on Igf2, which increases its expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele, in contrast, is unmethylated, so CTCF binds to the imprint control region and insulates it from the effect of the enhancers. This also leaves H19 unmethylated and the enhancers act on H19. H19 is therefore expressed on the maternal allele, by lgf2 is not.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is hypermethylation at the imprint control region, so both the maternal and paternal allele follow the normal methylation of the paternal allele, i.e. methylated at the imprint control region and the H19 promoter which results in lgf2 expression.</p>
<p>The disrupted imprinting at the H19/lgf2 cluster contributes to the disease because lgf2 is a growth promoting gene. This occurs early in tumorigenesis and the double dose of growth promoting lgf2 the causes development of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that is used for treating myelodysplastic syndromes (which progresses to acute myelogenous leaukaemia). Decitabine has the overall effect of DNA demethylation because it inhibits enzymes that maintain DNA methylation. When a cell is replicated, the DNA methylation marks are only present on one of the strands (it is hemimethylated). DNMTs target hemimethylated DNA and add the methyl groups to the previously unmethylated strand. A DNMTi like decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that becomes incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. Cancer cells are susceptible to DNMTi incorporation because they are rapidly dividing. When the DNMT enzyme encounters the DNMTi in the DNA, it is irreversibly bound and so cannot continue to maintain DNA methylation. While exact mechanisms are still unclear, this can prevent the maintenance of hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, allowing their expression and subsequent anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methyltransferase enzymes ensure that the epigenetic marks are maintained in daughter cells by methylating the unmethylated strand in hemimethylated DNA. If epigenetic marks are removed or added, they will be maintained in daughter cells by this process and so the effect of drugs may last beyond the period of drug treatment. However, this also means there are some periods of development where more caution should be exercised before treating a patient with epigenome modifying drugs.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one where there is significant epigenetic reprogramming taking place, such as early development (including fertilised eggs and blastocyst stages) or the development of primordial germ cells (where gametes are being produced). Currently approved drugs that target the epigenome are not selective for cancer epigenetics and so will alter the epigenome of all cells. If a patient were pregnant or a young person, this treatment may have undesirable or unknown effects on the development of the foetus or primordial germ cell development. The potential for long-lasting or intergenerational side-effects makes this treatment inadvisable.</p></div>
