    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>CpG islands are mostly clustered around promoters and usually they are unmethylated, allowing transcription to proceed.</li>
<li>CpG islands are hypermethylated in Cancer. CpG islands methylation start increasing from normal tissue to cancer and mostly with cancer invasion and metastasis.</li>
<li>Methylation at CpG islands in cancer is an alternative to genetic mutation on promoters of Tumor Suppressors. Methylation of CpG islands silences promoters of Tumor suppressor genes.It is recognized that DNA methylation can be one of the two hits formulated by Knudson hypothesis, as two silenced alleles are needed for tumorigenesis. Assuming one hit is a mutated allele, the second hit can be an epimutation, which is a methylated allele.</li>
<li>Normally Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated and transcriptionally silent.</li>
<li>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Historically this epigenetic dysregulation was observed as the earliest, and is observed in all tumours of different types. It is noticed, that hypomethylation in these regions, progresses with the degree of tumorigenicity, paralleling CpG islands hypermethylation, which increases with cancer progression.</li>
<li>The disruption of DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, causes fundamentally genomic instability.This instability is manifested differently according to location on a) repetitive elements and b) CpG poor promoters. Regarding repetive elements illegitimate recombination takes place among repeats, causing translocations among different portions of chromosomes(non homologous). This is evidence in several cancer types, such as  AML(acute mielogenous leukemia ) and APL(acute promyelocytic leukemia).Activation of repeats cause transpositions, causing insertions of transposable elements everywhere in the genome by cutting and paste mechanisms, altering finally the gene function, and causing the mosaicism and phenotypical variability as we see in (Agouti and Axinfu  genes in mice) . The hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters causes the activation of oncogenes, fostering tumorigenesis. </li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Normally, at the paternal allele, the ICR (Imprinting control region) or ICE (Imprinting control element) "is methylated". This ICR lies between the enhancer and the IGF2 gene, and also ICR is adjacent to H19 gene that transcribes a ncRNA (non-coding RNA). The methylation of the ICR, does not allow the CTCF, insulator protein, to bind to the ICR, consequently "the enhancer can activate the IGF2 gene that will start transcription". Also the methylated ICR silences the H19 gene expression, preventing the enhancer from activating the promoter of H19.</li>
<li>On the maternal allele ICR "is unmethylated", so the insulator CTCF is able to bind to ICR.But in this case due the presence of CTCF insulator at the ICR, the enhancer activates H19 and does not activate IGF2.</li>
<li>
<p>In Wilms tumour, at the maternal allele, ICR "is methylated"; so the maternal allele behaves as paternal, and expresses IGF2 and silences Cdkn1c( TS). </p>
</li>
<li>In Wilms tumour, there is biallelic expression of IGF2, because of loss of imprinting (LOI), in the maternal allele that may be due to deletion, mutation or epigenetic disrupting. Consequently there is a double production of IGF2, which as a growth factor estimulates tumorigenesis.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>They are demethylating agents. They inhibit DNMTs(DNA methyl transferases) enzymes.
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Decitabine acts during DNA replication stage. As the two DNA strands separate, the leading strand is hemimethylated (5-methylcytosine), so upon replication the daughter or forming strand is automatically methylated by DNMT1(maintenance enzyme) at the opposing C base. Decitabine neutralizes DNMT and prevents the methylation of the forming strand, so at cell division the daughter cell will have no DNA methylation.</li>
<li>
<p>Primarily, Decitabine drug was approved by FDA, and used successfully in MDS (Mielodysplastic syndrome), which is a precursor of AML (acute myelogenous leukemia). The main antitumour effect in this syndrome is due to the fact that there is an "increase in hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters at CpG islands", and Decitabine is effective inhibiting the methylation of Tumor suppressors promoters, and consequently activating these anticancer genes.</p>
</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation marks are mitotically inheritable, consequently daughter cells and granddaughter cells will carry and inherit the epigenetic marks after every cell division.What is inherited is the gene phenotype, or epigenome or gene expression. The implication of mitotic inheritance in cancer, is that epigenetic marks are erasable, different to mutations that are not. If drugs used in epigenetic therapy can neutralize or erase the epigenetic marks the effect will be very positive for mitotic heritability.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods are the most important epigenetic reprogramming periods, where establishment of epigenetic modifications or marks take place, as well eraser of previous epigenetic marks is done.</li>
<li>The first sensitive period comprises the preimplantation period.The second period is when Primordial germ cells are developed.</li>
<li>During first period a totipotential stage develops, after erasure of most epigenetic marks, and so differentiation of all tissues and organs could be achieved. Epigenetic therapy at this stage can alter this "necessary erasure of previous epigenetic marks".During the second period of epigenetic reprogramming is when "PGC are developed and imprinting marks are established". Severe childhood diseases due to LOI  can develop, if faulty imprinting takes place. </li>
