    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>CpG islands</strong> are often located at or near promoters, and normally the methylation of the CpG island means <em>silencing</em> of the corresponding gene. Usually (by and large genome-wide) CpG islands are ummethylated.</p>
<p>In many cancers CpG islands (again by and large genome-wide) are hypermethylated, including the promoters of the tumor suppressor genes, silencing the tumor suppressor genes, thus contributing to cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> usually methylated in normal cells. This helps maintain genomic stability, in one part by silencing cryptic splice sites and cryptic promoters.  It also silences repeats, and sometimes the mutagenic methylation destroys the transposon code.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cells the DNA in general is hypomethylated, so intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not methylated. This contributes to genomic instability and all sorts of mutations in cancers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So in normal cells CpG islands are usually unmethylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. </p>
<p>In cancers, the DNA as the hole is not methylated (in almost all cancers), except for CpG islands at tumor suppressor genes that may be methylated.  This blocks the anti-cancer machinery of the cell, and promotes mutations that increase the chance of further disruptions that may lead to more tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Normally</strong>, the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the Imprint Control Region (ICR) on the <em>paternal allele</em>.  This ICR is located between Igf2 and H19 genes.  Methylation of the ICR on the paternal allele blocks binding of a CTCF insulator protein. Without CTCF, the enhancers located downstream of the H19 gene can work on Igf2 gene, so it <em>is expressed from the paternal allele.</em></p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, CTCF binds to the ICR and blocks the enhancers (which work on H19 lncRNA instead), which leads to the Igf2 gene being <em>not expressed from the maternal allele</em>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In the Wilm's tumour the ICR is hypermethylated, so it is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles. Thus the imprinting is lost, and Igf2 is expressed from both alleles.</span></p>
<p>Overexpression of the Igf2 gene leads to the double dose of this protein.  It is a growth promoting protein, so this contributes to the growth of the cells (in kidneys) and may lead to cancerous tumours in kidneys.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor for DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Normally DNMT works by methylating DNA, so decitabine intake results in DNA demethylation, or global decrease of DNA methylation levels. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitbine works by replacing cytidine in the DNA synthesized during cell divisions, which affects chemical properties of CpGs, preventing their methilation by DNMT.  So it works only on dividing cells, which in actively growing cancers means cancer cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine can work on tumours that are caused by overactive DNMT that methylates CGIs of tumor suppressing genes promoters, silencing them.</p>
<p>If such tumours are treated with Decitabine, the global decrease of DNA methylation can make these genes expressed again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes, such as changes in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. So once changed, the epignetic marks in tumour will be preserved in future cell generations, even after the drug treatment is stopped.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">However, there are periods of the mammal embryon development when there is an active reprogramming of the DNA methylation of the embryon.  These are the periods between egg fertilisation to epiblast formation and the period of primordial germ cell development, both happen in the first weeks of gestation in humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During both these periods there is an active change of the DNA methylation levels in various regions. Any drug that can have an effect on methylation machinery should be avoided during these periods, as this can have a drastic and possibly lethal effect on the developing embryon or even on the third generation if primordial germ cells methylation is affected.</span></p></div>
