In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the epigenetic changes to DNA that control how tightly it is packaged and whether a particular gene is expressed is the addition of methylation at CpG islands, that is places in the genome where there is a higher than usual number of cytosine bases immediately next to guanines.  These marks are inherited each time the cell divides.  These CpG islands are usually found near gene promotors and are generally not methylated in normal cells, allowing the associated gene to be expressed.  A feature all cancer types so far studied is that these CpG islands are methylated to a higher than usual extent having the effect of silencing the gene.    (Working with genetic changes)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of two cancer therapeutics approved by the American FDA for use against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) , although research is being carried out in the hope that it may also be effective in solid tumors.  It works as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, that is, once replication has occurred and DNMT1  is bound to the Cytosine nucleotide, Decitabine prevents its release so that the methyl group cannot be copied on to the daughter strand and the degree of methylation will decrease with each replication.  Because they replicate more than normal cells, Decitabine kills tumor cells more than healthy cells and if given at the right stage of the disease and at the best dose that causes DNA demethylation, is well tolerated with relatively few side effects. </p></div>
