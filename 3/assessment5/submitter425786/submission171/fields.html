    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Studies have shown that DNA methylation is altered in cancer. In a normal cell, CpG islands are usually hypo-methylated, whereas the rest of the genome, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, is more likely to be methylated. On the contrary, in cancer, CpG islands are hyper-methylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypo-methylated. This disruption of the normal function of DNA methylation can lead to cancer. In the case of CpG islands, these regions tend to be in promoters of genes that are called tumour suppressors and control the growth of cells. When CpG islands are hyper-methylated, these tumour suppressor genes are more likely to be silenced and therefore cell growth is uncontrolled, which leads to tumours and thus cancer. In parallel, in the case of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, hypo-methylation contributes to genomic instability and chromatin being more open instead of densely packaged. Therefore, there can be various consequences which may contribute to disease. These consequences include chromosomal recombinations, which shouldn’t occur, chromosomal deletions or insertions; or more repeats occur and transposable elements may copy themselves and disrupt other genes; or poor CpG promoters may be activated. Therefore, alteration of DNA methylation either hyper-methylation of CpG islands or hypo-methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions may contribute to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, as in the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. Normally, one of the alleles is imprinted and the expression of Igf is regulated. In a normal cell, the maternal allele is not methylated, as a consequence the enhancers cannot act on Igf2 and thus Igf is not expressed. On the other hand, the paternal allele is methylated, so the enhancers are able to act on Igf2 and therefore Igf is expressed. When there is a loss of imprinting, however, the maternal allele is also methylated, so both alleles of the genes are hyper-methylated and therefore the enhancers of both alleles can act on Igf, so there is a double expression of Igf2. Since Igf2 promotes cell growth, overexpression of Igf2 contributes to tumour genesis and disease. In particular, the disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster and thus the overxpression of Igf2 is seen in a childhood kidney tumour, Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several drugs that affect epigenetic processes. The drug known as Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which is a group of drugs that act as epigenetic regulators and may be used in cancer treatment. In cancer, because enzymes that regulate the process of DNA methylation are overactive, it seems that DNA is hyper-methylated, therefore silencing the genes that suppress cell overgrowth. This kind of drugs, such as Decitabine, impact DNA methylation by inhibiting the activity of enzymes which regulate DNA methylation, thus reducing the growth of tumour cells. Since the drug acts on the activity of the enzyme responsible for DNA methylation, its action epigenetically modifies the cell. The epigenetic change is subsequently inherited to the daughter cells by cell division. Therefore, Decitabine can have a lasting anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification and as such it is mitotically heritable to the daughter cells by cell division. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, drugs that alter DNA methylation  have more effect in cancer cells and the changes these drugs induce are transmitted to the daughter cells. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome and the effects of epigenetic drugs remain beyond the treatment period.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where epigenetic alterations have important consequences for the person, such as if the germline is affected. Sensitive periods of development are puberty and early embryonic development (between zygote and blastocyte). Therefore, treating patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, such as adolescence or during pregnancy, would be inadvisable, because the drugs would affect the germline and thus would have potential consequences for future generations.</p></div>
