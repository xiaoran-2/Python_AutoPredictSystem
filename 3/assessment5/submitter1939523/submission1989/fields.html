    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a common mechanism for silencing portions of the genome.  Methylation occurs at cytosine and is associated with the cytosines next to a guanine.  This association is referred to as CpGs.  When you look at the genome you see methylation of CpGs in DNA in 3 distinct areas.  CpG islands associated with gene promoters, CpGs in intergenic regions of the genome, and CpGs at areas called repetitive elements.  CpG islands are normally hypomethlyated while it is usually hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repeats.</p>
<p>CpG islands are associated with gene promoters so when they are not methylated it means the gene is expressed.  There is an exception with facultative heterochromatin where hypermethylated is used to ensure a skin cell does not produce myoglobin and a muscle cell does not produce keratin. Now if you suddenly methylate a CpG island/promoter for say TNF this means you turn off the production of TNF and this cell line can no longer help elimanate or combate a cancerous process. This sudden change in CpG island methlyation could cause a muscle cell which was producing healthly contractile proteins to stop and become nonfunctional therefore producing disease such as muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>DNA-CpG methylation of intergenic regions and repeats are higher than CpG islands.  This contributes to genomic stability by keeping cryptic promotors off and not interferring with the production of adjacent genetic material.  If an intergenic area becomes hypomethylated you could turn on a cryptic promotor for a cancerous process or it could move in an antisense direction and interfere with the production of the upstream protein and cause disease such as Alzheimer's lack of acetylcholine. </p>
<p>DNA-CpG methlyation of repeats inhibits their ability to jump around the genome promoting carcinogenic and various disease processes via the methods discussed above.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting refers to a process where methylation occurs at an imprint control region, ICR, at a gene cluster on a parent chromosome causing monoallelic expression either for against the imprinted/methylated allele.  ICR DNA methylation does not alway correlate with silencing of gene expression.  Let's look at the H19/Igf2 cluster.  Typically it is imprinted/methylated on the paternal allele.  This allows enhancers to go upstream and activate Igf2 which is a oncogen in that it promotes growth.  The methylated ICR also spreads downstream and silences H19 expression.  On the maternal chromosome this ICR is unmethylated and allows the binding of an insulator protein which deflects the enhancers thereby forcing them to activate the downstream H19 and not the upstream Igf2. </p>
<p>If imprinting is lost this can cause a dosage compensation problem and now you do not have monoallelic expression so you can now experience either overexpression of growth promoting genes such as Igf2 or the loss of tumor suppressor genes such as Cdkn1c. The loss of regulation of the growth of various tissues, such as the kidneys, are seen in the childhood condition of Wilm's tumor where there is overexpression of Igf2.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is now a disease of gene mutations and/or a disease process of epigenetic disregulation.  Methylation pattern of our DNA is important for the expression or silencing of various aspects of our genome and there are several epigenetic processes occuring to impact DNA methylation.  Generally our genome has hypomethylated CpG islands/promoters and methylated intergenic regions and repeats.  However, in cancer this pattern can be terribly reversed.  Treatment and vigorous research is being done to investigate the impact of various agents on our epigenetic machingery.  Decitabine is a nice example of a DNA demethylating agent.  It is being used to demethylate various CpG islands that have been inappropriately silenced (such as TNF) allowing for the expression of cancer.  The elegant aspect of reactivating a gene is after mitosis the suppression no longer exists. The cell line is now cancer free so whatever caused the carcinogenic process is no more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are important for the establishment of normal cellular lineages and function. All cells have the same genome but not all cells express all of the genes of the genome.  Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation play a big role in this and are mitotically heritable. Changing the methylation pattern will be seen in daughter cells.  This can benefit in the treatment of cancer as Improper methylation patterns are quite common   Drug therapies which impact cancerous methylation patterns would be advantagious as the daughter cells would be cancer free or partially reset. </p>
<p>There are times when resetting methylation patterns are normal and must not be interfered with.  The fertilized egg must clear the methylation patterns of it's predecessors - the egg and the sperm.  This new individual first becomes pleuripotent until around the time of implantation and gastrulation.  This is a very sensitive time as disruption of methylation patterns developing will not allow for proper formation of the embryo.  Another sensitive time is during gametogenesis or primordial germ cell development.  You want the egg and sperm to have their very specific methylation patterns so clearing and resetting occurs during this time and interference would result in undesirable consequences. </p></div>
