    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to switch off gene expression. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNA methylation of certain CpG islands is increased in cancer, they become hypermethylated. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter of a tumour suppressor gene, stopping its expression, would increase the cancerous nature of a cell as it increases the ability to divide uncontrollably.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNA methylation is normally present in intergenic regions to maintain genomic stability (stopping deletions, reciprocal translocations and intertions), and at repetitive elements to silence the expression of repetitive elements, to prevent transposition and so also maintain genomic stability.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is decreased in cancer cells.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Disruption of DNA methylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions contributes to disease as it increases genomic instability. There are more deletions, reciprocal translocations- illegitimate recombination between repeats, and insertions, more transposition occurs because repetitive elements are no longer silenced being unmethylated, and activation of cryptic promoters, which disrupt neighbouring gene expression, occurs. </span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is that the ICR is methylated, this causes Igf2 to be expressed as the enhancers are able to act on it, promoting its expression.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The methylation pattern of the maternal allele is that the ICR is unmethlated, enabling an insulator protein CTCF to bind to it. This stops the enhancers from acting on the Igf2 gene so it is not expressed.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In Wilm’s tumour the ICR in the maternal chromosome is methylated when in a normal cell it would be unmethylated, so both alleles act like the paternal allele.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">This contributes to disease as there are now two copies of the Igf2 gene being expressed, so there is twice the level of Igf2 being produced. This promotes growth. </span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor.</li>
<li>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is that it decreases DNA methylation, by preventing DNA methylation from being re-established after DNA replication.</li>
<li>Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by decreasing the methylation of hypermethylated CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes, so there is increased expression of these tumour suppressor genes.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so once it is established it is passed on to all daughter cells produced. Once erased, the DNA methylation will not return, so drugs which alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</li>
<li>A sensitive period is a period in development when the genome is undergoing active epigenetic reprogramming, so the environment is more able to influence epigenetic makeup.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods of development include the time from fertilisation to early post implantation of the embryo, and between when the primordial germ cells are being developed in the early embryo to the production of mature eggs and sperm.</li>
<li>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as there may be more epigenetic errors made than in less sensitive periods, which could cause huge problems to them in later life. In addition germ cells, and consequentially the gametes, could have epigenetic errors, which may be passed on to offspring.</li>
