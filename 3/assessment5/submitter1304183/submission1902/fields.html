    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually usually associated with the promoter regions of the genes. In a normal cell, CpG islands have been found to be unmethylated. This unmethylated CpG islands thus have consequences on chromosomal packing which leads to subsequent gene silencing or inactivation. Thus the normal function of the hypomethylation of the CpG islands is for effective silencing of gene expression. Also methylation of CpG island indicates X chromosome inactivation.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell CpG island is hypermethylated.The hypermethylation occuring at CpG island results in the activation of gene expression, especially cancer causing genes like oncogenes.</p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can contribute to disease, when there is hypermethylation, expression of some genes might be triggered such as oncogenes. This can thus contribute to development of diseas such as cancer.</p>
<p>However, DNA methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are different, in the sence that they are methylated compared to the CpG islands. The methylation in these regions have thus contributed to the maintainance of genomic stability in the region. Methylation have been found to contribute to silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interfernce with strong promoters also it has been found to contribute to the silencing of repeats to prevent unwanted recombination as well as preventing transposition.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements becomes unmethylated, thus repeats are not silenced, transpositions are occuring and genes jump from one location to another to be expressed, this inturn can result into cancer.</p>
<p>Diseases can result when DNA methylation in intergenic region and repetitive elements becomes unmethylated. for example transposition or transcriptional interference may occur where it ought not to, this could result in several different diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>using the H19/Igf2 cluster, it is found that the imprint control center is methylated in the paternal allele. The absence of CTCF, insulator protein allows the spreading of DNA methylation to the promoter of H19, which silences it, thus allowing enhancer to access Igf2  for its activation.</p>
<p>While the imprint control center is unmethylated in the maternal allele, thus allows for the binding of CTCF which inturn insulates Igf2  from the enhancer. This then causes Igf2 not to be expressed in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>An imprinting disorder have been found to be associated with the upregulation of Igf2, which is a growth promoter. This results in oncogenes which can eventually result in cancer. In the wilm's tumour for example, there is Igf2 upregulation.</p>
<p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, imprinting can be distrupted which can result in ending up with two copies of one parental allele. when this occur for example in Beckwith  Wiedemann syndrome, diseases could occur. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of epigenetic inhibitors known as the hypomethylating agents, which acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransfarase on a DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine is effective on DNA methylation by causing a removal of methyl group from DNA, thus have effect on the mechanism which leads to the silencing of gene.</p>
<p>Thus this mechanism of removal of methyl group and subsequent silencing of gene prior to hypomethylation have anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is true that drug that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment possibly due to the fact that DNA methylation are mitoticallly heritable, thus epigenetic modifications are passed to daughter cells during cell division. This could thus endure for some time before being eventually erased.</p>
<p>However there are certain period which is called the sensitive period, a period of epigenetic reprograming, when epigenetic marks are cleared and reset during premodial germ cell development and early embryonic development, treatment of patients with such drugs should be avoided.</p>
<p>It has been found that during the sensitive period, the maternal genome is passively demethylated while the paternal genome is actively and rapidly demethylated, like wise, repeats and imprinted genes maintain a high level of methylation. This methylation level could have adverse effect and lead to epigenetic abnormalities. </p></div>
