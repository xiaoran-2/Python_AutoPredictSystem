<p>CpG islands, is an important part of the mechanisms that govern X-chromosome inactivation; it is also essential for the maintenance of imprinted genes and, in some cases, is critical in determining the cell-type-specific expression patterns of genes.</p>
<p>DNA Methylation at CpG  islands controls the gene expression in normal cells.  In a normal cell, we see a hypomethylated CpG island. We don't see methylation in general at CpG islands in normal cells.  In cancer cells this is disrupted. In  cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. They're not all methylated, but they are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell.  This is  called CpG island hypermethylation.</p>
<p>CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.  So, hypermethylation in CpG island can inactivate tumor suppressor genes, eventually silencing the these genes. It has been found in most tumors that have ever been studied.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the repetitive elements, and intergenic elements and are hypermethylated.  Main function of this methylation is to maintain the genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer cells these elements are hypomethylated.  That is, there is decreased methylation in this region. This hypomethylation occurs most commonly at repeats.  This causes genomic instability.  We gain or lose chromosomes or illegitimate recombination occurs in chromosomes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells  repeats can be activated because of the hypomethylation. Repeats have the capacity to actually make a copy of themselves and can jump around the genome. They may even disrupt the coding region of a gene or  may activate neighboring genes. This can lead to transcriptional aberration in the  surrounding regions. This genomic instability contribute to the abnormal behavior of the cancer cell, which progrsses into a disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic abnormalities happen in every cancer. DNA methylation can change the various gene expression. By changing DNA methylation, the drug can disrupt the epigenetic machinary.  Epigenetic control is critical for all cell types. If a drug that inhibits DNA methylation in all tissues, that results in bad effect later on. At very high dosage these drugs are dangerous and toxic. They're not actually very good at getting rid of cancer. At lower doses these drugs are found to be more effective. </p>
<p>They hit most all dividing cells to some extent, it is not really known,  what the long term consequences would be on normal cells. It is found that, myelodysplastic syndrome patients tolerate these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors extremely well. Still these drugs effect every cell.<br /><br /> It should be kept in mind that these drugs are inappropiate for sensitive periods in younger patients, at the age when they  have developing germ cells.  </p>
<p>During the sensitive period one very large insult to the environment would be, taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.  As, this drug effects all cells, including the developing germ cells and can change the epigenetic machniary in offspring and in future genration.<br /><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs the class of epigenetic drugs on the market that contains DNA-demethylating agents.  This drug is one of the methyltransferase inhibitors. It  is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p>
<p>This drug (and similar one azacitidine) help to reduce the DNA methylation along with histone- deacetylase inhibitor, which can slow the tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This type of combination epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way.</p>
<p>As we have learned, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. This  therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.  this drug is proven to be effective in reduction of tumor in many other types of cancers like ovarian cancer, colon cancern etc.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting.  Lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth.  Either they're growth promoting or growth suppressing.  Cosidering H19/Igf2 cluster,  in normal cell, where there is specific imprint control region, which  is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. <br /><br />In normal cell, CTCF 4 binds the insulator element, leading the ehancers to act on H19 in maternal allele.  In paternal allele the situation is opposite, CTFC does not binding to insulate and IGF2 is expressed on  the paternal allel and here Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p> With loss of imprinting  there is hypermethylation in imprint control region on the maternal allele as well.  This gives rise to expression of Igf2 on maternal allele too.  That gives double dose of Igf2.  Since, Igf2 is growth promoting gene and is associated with Wilm's tumor.  This is particularly childhood kidney tumor.  <br /><br />This type of loss of imprinting is obeserved in wide array of tumor types. So, as explained above, disruption in imprint control region lead to over expression of growth promoting Genes like IgF2, which leads to formation of tumor at early age.<br /> </p>
