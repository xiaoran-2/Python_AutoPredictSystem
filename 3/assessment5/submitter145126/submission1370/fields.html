    <h1>Submission 1370 from Anon (session_user_id: 0dfa4abbeb3a96e666f5dff5c2efd2302b294d47)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. As a nucleoside analogue (it "pretends" to be a DNA base even though it isn't one), it gets incorporated into DNA when a cell replicates. The DNMT1 protein oridnarily copies the epigenetic methylation marks from the original strand to the newly replicated strand. But when DNMT1 encounters the decitabine base, the DNMT1 is bound irreversably and is never released. This depletes the DNMT1 available, preventing the DNA methylation from being copied to the replicated cells. Because cancer cells replicate much more than healthy cells, this has the effect of lowering the overall methylation in cancer cells more than other cells as the tumor tries to grow. The now hypomethylated cells can end up with now-working copies of tumor suppressor genes (previously silenced by the cancer's hypermethylation of CpG islands in their promoters), bringing the tumor under control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on future generations beyond the drug treatment period by affecting the methylation of DNA in developing embryos and germ cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development susceptible to environmental signals and disruption. In mammals, such periods include the times of pre-implantation development and of primordial germ cell development. These are sensitive since these are times when methylation marks are reset (of non-imprinted regions during pre-implantation, and of imprint control regions in PGC development). In females, this germ cell development of ovaries continues throughout adolescence and pre-pubescence, making this time also a sensitive period.</p>
<p><span>Treating patients with DNA-methylation-altering-drugs during these sensitive periods of development of a child is inadvisable since it can disrupt the proper demethylation or re-methylation of both the child, and the grandchild (since the grandchild primordial germ cells already exist within the grandmother before they are born!), known as incomplete epigenetic reprogramming. This </span>epimutagenic effect can affect the health and lifespan of future generations, since improper methylation can activate/deactivate important genes which are activated/deactivated by where the genome is methylated, via mechanisms described in earlier questions. Epimutagenic mutations can even cause DNA sequence mutations if the epigenetic changes affect genomic stability during times of rapid growth, e.g. embryo development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, CpG islands (containing higher concentration of Cytosine-Guanine base pairs than normal) often occur near promoter regions where protein transcription factors bind.  CpG islands are usually protected from methylation. However, methylation of CpG islands promoter regions silences transcription, because methylated CpG is bound by MeCP proteins which contain transcriptional repression domains &amp; recruit factors that condense the region into heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In cancer, methylation patterns are altered; genes once silenced by promoter CpG methylation can become unsilenced through hypomethylation, and actively transcribed regions become silenced by upstream CpG hypermethylation. Often, locus specific tumor suppressor genes (or sets of tumor suppressors) become silenced in cancer by hypermethylation. Hypomethylation of CpG promoters near some loci activates oncogenes, e.g. activating a protein that itself suppresses a tumor supressor.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions (between coding regions) maintains genomic stability. Methylation prevents deletions, translocations or insertions into the DNA, &amp; prevents transcription of a protein in the antisense strand or splicing of DNA in the antisense strand; without methylation we may get sequences where transcription factors bind on the wrong strand or splice in the wrong location. In cancer, genome wide hypomethylation shuts off these protections, &amp; DNA mutation can occur.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements often contain self-replicating DNA that pastes itself elsewhere in the DNA, which by its nature is very mutagenic. If pasted into the middle of a coding region, that protein no longer gets created. Also, long terminal repeats on both ends contain strong promoters that cause transcription. If it pastes itself in front of a normally silenced protein, the LTR promoter causes transcription. Methylation of CpG islands within LTRs silence this translocation behavior by deactivating the strong promoter, maintaining genomic stability. In cancer, these areas become demethylated and thus unsilenced, allowing proteins downstream of the LTR to be activated, deactivation of normally-active proteins if the LTR jumps into the middle, &amp; is prone to illegitimate recombination. As earlier, if the wrong gene is activated/deactivated, tumor suppressors can be silenced &amp; oncogenes activated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster exhibits imprinting based on the parental origin of the copy of the gene. The cluster contains an imprint control region, unmethylated in the maternal allele and methylated in the paternal. Upstream from the ICR is the Igf2 growth factor protein, while downstream is both the H19 long non-coding RNA and some enhancer regions. The enhancer regions can act on the Igf2 or H19, with preference for acting on Igf2 if possible (via a chromatin looping mechanism).</p>
<p>In a healthy subject, the maternally unmethylated ICR binds an insulator protein CTCF, which prevents the enhancers from acting on Igf2, suppressing its expression. Instead they act to transcribe the H19 lncRNA, which really just acts as a "sink" for the enhancers and the H19 doesn't have a direct effect on growth.</p>
<p>Paternally, the methylated ICR does not bind CTCF, and in addition the ICR's methylation spreads to the promoter region of H19, silencing it. The enhancers end up acting on Igf2, expressing it.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the patient has the ICR of both copies methylated like in the healthy paternal allele, and we thus get double dose of the Igf2 growth factor. The excess growth factor causes cancer-like growth.</p></div>
