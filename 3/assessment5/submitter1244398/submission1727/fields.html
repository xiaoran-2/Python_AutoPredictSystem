    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern of DNA methylation is often inverted in cancerous cells. In a non-cancerous, normal cell, CpG islands and shores are typically unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. The reverse is true in a cancer cell; CpG islands (and shores) undergo hypermethylation, while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements . undergo hypomethylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is associated with the silencing of gene activation. In a normal cell, CpG islands preceding tumour suppressor genes are unmethylated, allowing transcription of the genes. In a cancer cell, this is disrupted, and the tumour suppressor genes are silenced. An example of a type of tumour suppressor gene is one that helps to regulate life cycle of the cell - if this is silenced then this can lead to the cell growing and reproducing uncontrollably (as in cancer). Another example is that of DNA repair genes; if these are silenced then the cell is more likely to develop harmful mutations (due to the decreased DNA repair). The increased mutation rate can then also trigger more silencing of other tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in a normal cell. This protects the cell by silencing ongocene promoter genes and parasitic repeater regions. Hypomethylation of these areas in cancer leads to increased chromosone instability, where there is a loss of imprinting and reactivation repeats and transpositions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele (H19 from the maternal allele, and Igf2 from the paternal allele).</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the enhancer region activates the H19 promoter genes. There is also a CTCF protein that binds to the imprint control region for the H19/Igf2 cluster. This insulates the Igf2 gene from the enhancers, meaning that it's been silenced.</p>
<p> On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated, which blocks the CTCF protein from binding. The absence of the CTCF protein allows the H19 promoter to be methylated, silencing it. This then allows the enhancers to access to Igf2 to activate it.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele as well, meaning that both alleles express Igf2 and neither expresses H19.</p>
<p>As Igf2 is a key fetal growth factor, disruption of the expression of this factor will likely cause a number of problems, with overexpression of growth promoting genes in Wilm's tumour, causing tumours of the kidneys (in children).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks are maintained across replication - therefore changing the DNA methylation of a tumour cell can have a lasting effect, as the changed methylation state is maintained in the daughter tumour cells as well.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of development where the environment can have a large influence on the epigenetic makeup of the person (or creature). Sensitive periods of development include the times when the epigenome is remodeled (so where the epigenetic marks are removed and then reestablished). Cells in a sensitive period include fertilised cells (pre-implantation), and primordial germ cells.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that environmental impacts in the early stages of pregnancy, and even in children up to puberty can have long lasting effects on their epigenome. For example, children that were conceived in the Dutch Famine (1944/45) had less methyl groups on the Igf2 gene (and some imprinted genes), which translated into poorer health outcomes later in life.</p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods could be inadvisable, as it could potentially affect future generations. Giving young patients with epigenetic treatments can cause changes to their germ cells, and the effects of this are not well enough known yet to confidently predict.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It works by hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine can be incorporated into the DNA. When DNMT attempts to copy the methylation of the DNA during replication, decitabine binds to it instead, preventing the methylation from being repeated in the daughter cells. This will have an anti-tumour effect, as this can reverse the hypermethylation of (for example) tumour suppressor genes in CpG islands. This effect requires the cell to replicate to work, and as cancer cells replicate much more rapidly than normal cells, the effects will be much greater on the cancerous cells.  </p></div>
