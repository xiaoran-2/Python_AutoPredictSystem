    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal non-cancerous cells, CpG islands within promoter regions are typically free of methylation, or are hypomethylated, to enable gene expression. In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated, and this promotes genome stability. Intergenic methylation of repetitive elements is thought to ‘silence’ these sites, which may act as alternative start sites. Methylation of these intergenic repetitive elements is therefore thought to prevent antisense transcription, direct RNA splicing and to ensure correct replication timing</p>
<p>In cancerous cells, CpG islands within promoter regions tend to become hypermethylated, and the level of hypermethyalation increases with time. CpG islands are typically found within the promoters of tumor-supressor genes. The function of tumor-supressor genes is to stop uncontrolled cell proliferation. Silencing these genes can result in tumour development as all daughter cells of a cancerous cells will have the same hypermethylated CpG islands. Cells with silenced tumor suppressor genes possess an advantage over those that do not, in that they can replicate faster and will survive longer. Cancerous cells can therefore rapidly out-compete normal cells in the tissue, and form a tumour.</p>
<p>The rest of the genome, including intergenic regions and repetitive elements, is hypomethylated in cancerous cells. This hypomethylation also increases over time in cancerous cells, and results in genomic instability. Increased genomic instability occurs as a result of hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements due to illegitimate recombination between hypothmethylated repeat regions on neighbouring chromosomes. These regions are normally heavily methylated and packaged into heterochromatin to avoid illegal recombination. Hypothmethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements can also lead to activation of repeats, or transposition, where transposons are inserted into other genomic regions, which can disrupt normal gene expression. It is by all of these mechanisms that genomic instability can result in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cells is a loss of imprinting, in that cancerous cells can either express both parental alleles or both parental alleles are silent. This is thought to be because many of these imprinted genes are somehow related to growth. In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, in a normal cell, the imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele. This enables CTCF to bind to the insulator element on the maternal allele, enabling the enhancers to act on H19, resulting in expression of H19 but not Igf2, from the maternal allele. Normally, the insulator element is methylated on the paternal allele, enabling the enhancers to act on Igf2, resulting in expression of Igf2 but not H19, from the paternal allele. This way, both Igf2 and H19 are expressed.</p>
<p> In Wilm’s tumour, the imprint control region is also methylated on the maternal allele, which results in production of Igf2 from both parental alleles, and a complete lack of H19 expression. Therefore, twice the amount of Igf2 is produced, which is growth promoting. This leads to development of a kidney tumor, Wilm’s tumor, in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) class of epigenetic inhibitors and is used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the growing DNA strand during DNA replication. The nucleoside analogue incorporated  into the parental strand binds to DNMT1 as the enzyme attempts to copy parental methylation to the newly synthesized daughter strand. The DNMT1  becomes irreversibly bound, and it cannot be released. This mechanism of DNA methyltransferase inhibition is dependent on cell replication. As cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, cancer cells will be more severely affected by the actions of DNMTis.</p>
<p>Decitabine causes DNA demethylation in tumour cells resulting in tumour death, however the exact mechanism and specificity of this class of drug, remains unknown. It is thought that Decitabine is effective for treating Myelodysplastic syndrome as this form of cancer is thought be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is speculated that altering DNA methylation can have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. Drug-induced epigenetic changes are inherited by all daughter and grand-daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once the changes have been eradicated, it is thought that they do not return.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are those periods when epigenetic marks are being established. This would be from the development of primordial germ cells right through the production of mature eggs and sperm, a sensitive period specific to younger individuals. The other sensitive period is the pre and early post implantation period, a period specific to women in the early stages of pregnancy and her developing embryo. It would therefore be inadvisable to treat young patients or pregnant women with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods as both are periods of active remodelling of epigenome that involves the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks. Interfering with these sensitive periods would affect correct establishment of epigenetic marks, which could lead to altered gene expression and disease.</p>
