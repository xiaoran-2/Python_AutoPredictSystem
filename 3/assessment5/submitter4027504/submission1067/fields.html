    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are hypomethylated. Inversly in Cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, especially at promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. This leads to inactivation of these genes, and thus the cell loses its ability to prevent overgrowth or undergo apoptosis.</p>
<p>Normally, repeating elements and intergenic regions are hypermethylated. In cancer, however, they are hypomethylated, which causes Genomic instability, more specifically termed illigitimate recombination between repeats such as reciprocal translocation between non homologous chromosomes. Repeats can also be activated because of the hypomethylation which means they can make a copy of themselves and transpose, possibly causing disruptions in host genes or activating neighboring genes. This leads to transcriptional abbarations in surrounding genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors termed DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine demethylates DNA leading to a hypomethylation status of DNA. Hypomethylated DNA in cancerous cells makes these cells more prone to routine chemotherapeutic drugs because the effect of the drug is permanent. Thus Decitabine stops a cancer growing without killing cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be passed on from mother cell to daughter cell during DNA replication. The absence of methylation marks on DNA of mother cell means daughter cell will not have the marks as well. Moreover, a sensitive period is the age at which an individual is more susceptible to changes in epigenetic marks, such as at puberty, whereby primordial stem cells would be forming, or during zygote pre-implantation in uterus. Therefore, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because that would increase the probability of causing non-specific epigenetic modifications to normal cells in the body.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, ICR downstream of Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on maternal allele. This means that on the maternal allele, CTCF binds the unmethylated ICR and H19 downstream of ICR is acted upon by downstream enhancers promoting H19 expression while Igf2 is silenced. Whereas on paternal allele, CTCF can't bind the methylated ICR, which means that enhancers act on Igf2 and promote its expression</p>
<p>Cancer cells (Wilm's tumor) display loss of imprinting through hypermethylation of imprint control region downstream of Igf2 on both parental alleles. This means that we have expression of both parental alleles of Igf2.Thus, now we have a double dose of this growth promoting protein, leading to Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
