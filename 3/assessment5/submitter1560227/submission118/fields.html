    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally hypomethylated, but the inverse (hypermethylation) is seen in cancers which has the effect of activating surrounding structures that are normally repressed.  These surrounding structures code for the expression or repression of proteins (such as tumor suppressors) or epigenetic modifiers, so too much is produced or none at all relative to normalcy which henceforth can cause cancer or other diseases; there is also a disruption of imprinting.  Genome-wide is normally hypermethylated, but in cancer, intergenic regions, repetitive elements and CpG poor promoters will be hypomethylated.  This has the effect of causing genomic instability via disrupting deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions, among others; there is also a disruption of imprinting and CpG poor promoters can also activate genes.  Such genomic instability is a hallmark of many cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruptions in ICRs can result in the overexpression of growth promoting genes as well as the repression of growth restricting genes.  This is common in the early, pre-neoplastic stage of cancer.  In the H18/IGF2 case, the paternal allele is normally hypermethylated at the ICR and H19, promoting the expression of IGF2.  In contrast, the maternal allele is normally hypomethylated at the ICR allowing for CTCF binding, promoting the expression of H19.  In Wilm's Tumor, the maternal allele is identical to the paternal allele, promoting an overexpression of IGF2 (and its protein IGLF2).  ILGF2 promotes the growth and division of cells, so the overexpression of IGF2 has the potential to act as an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the class of DNA methylation inhibitor drugs, i.e. it will hypomethylate DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  As a result, it is useful at CpG islands to revert the hypermethylated state seen in cancer back to a normal, hypomethylated state.  This normal, hypomethylated state promotes the [re]activation of tumor-supressing genes, such as DNMT1.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable which will last beyond the period of epigenetic drug treatment, causing epimutations to be enduringly replicated, whether that is hypermethylation, hypomethylation or both.  Such epigenetic drugs should be avoided during a sensitive period which are periods when there is epigenetic programming going on.  There are three sensitive periods: the pre-embryo stage, the gamete stage and the late childhood stage when the germ cells are forming.  The long-term effects of treating patients with such epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods are unknown.</p></div>
