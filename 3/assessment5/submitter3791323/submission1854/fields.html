    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways.  Firstly, global methylation of the genome decreases.  This reduces  gene silencing across the genome in cancer cells.  Secondly, CpG island methylation increases in cancer. All cancers display these two events.  <br />CpG islands are associated with transcription promoter regions.  When CpG islands are methylated, genes downstream decrease expression. In normal cells, CpG islands methylation helps to direct tissue specific transcription, allowing some genes to be turned on or off. <br />In cancer,  CpG islands throughout the genome demonstrate increased methylation.  This means adjacent gene products are reduced downstream of CpG islands - effective silencing.  If tumor suppression genes are located downstream of methylated CpG islands, the likelihood of tumor growth increases.  This methylation may be the result of early cancer, contributing to cancer growth by stopping the transcription of tumor-suppression proteins   This methylation could also be the cause of the cancer.  If environmental factors cause hypermethylation of critical CpG islands, this could cause tumor growth.   CpG island methylation is diagnostic of the presence of the cancer.  In addition to silencing tumor suppressor genes in cells, CpG island methylation in cancer cells will suppress transcription of vital tissue-specific genes causing diseased tissue to reduce functionality.<br />In normal cells, the regions between genes and repeats generally have a high degree of methylation resulting in silencing these regions in normal cells, thus stabilizing the genome.   In cancer cells methylation decreases in these regions. This decrease activates transcription in intergenic regions and repeats creating genomic instability.  Many repeats are transposons capable of moving within the genome when transcribed. The hypomethylation of repeats leads to translocations, insertions and deletions, major chromosomal defects. These defects affect the amount of various gene products available to the cell. Hypomethylation of these regions may also interfere with imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the differential expression of genes based upon the contributing parent’s gender.  An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. H19 is an area of the DNA that produces a long, non-coding RNA.  The H19 gene is located downstream from Igf2 -- a growth factor gene. Downstream from H19 are enhancers.  The maternal gene produces H19 because is has an unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) allowing a transcription control factor, CTFC, to bind at this site.  This prevents the enhancers access the Igf2 locus and allows the H19 transcription.   The paternal gene produces Igf2 because the ICR is methylated and this methylation spreads to the H19 locus allowing the enhancers access to Igf2 - no H19 is produced from the paternal chromsome.  Wilm’s tumor patients have lost the imprinting of the maternal allele causing the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele.  These individuals have increased Igf2 production as both alleles are being transcribed and translated.  Hypermethylation of the maternal allele causes Wilm’s tumor -- primarily in children.  Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome is an epigenetic disorder where the child has growth issues due the extra expressions of Igf2 from both alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heretitable due to the action DMNTI and other DNA methyltransferases. These proteins transfer methylation maks from template strand to the daughter strand. DNA methylation marks are established during sensitive period of development. Sensitive periods are times during which the epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation are being actively programmed or reprogrammed. These times include include early development; the time between fertilization and blastocyst formation, the time in which the primoridial germ cells are being established; as well as times in development when tissue specific marks are being established to determine cells for later differentiation.  At these points the treating patients with drugs that would change the epigenome may have consequences for several generations due to the mitotic heritability of the epigenetic marks.   If treatment during any sensitve periods could cause demethylation of important marks such as imprinting thus having life-long consequences.   in general in cancer there is a pattern of global demethylation that also occurs simultaneously with the methylation of the CpG islands.  Thus using a drug that demethylates DNA may actual increase the possibility of cancer in some tissues. <br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug developed by Eisai; it promotes the demethylation of DNA by inhibiting the action of DMNT1 a protein responsible for transferring the methylation epigenetic marks during DNA replication. Thus Decitabine dilutes methylation marks as opposed to actively removing existing methylation. Normal cells regulate the growth of the cell through the mitotic process. Inability to make the proteins responsible for this control is an early signal of cancer.  One characteristic of cancer is unrestrained growth, caused by the inability of the epigenome  to regulate growth factors. In cancer cells, CpG islands demonstrate increased methylation, silencing important genes that suppress tumors and reduce tissue-specific proteins.    Since cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than normal cells, CpG islands  become increasingly demethylated after each cell division allowing the daughter cells to restart production of tumor suppressing proteins - fighting the cancer from within.</p></div>
