    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands (high density CpG), generally is almost equal to <strong>silencing of gene expression. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In normal cell, CpG islands are generally not methylated while the repetitive element through intergenic regions and even introns are methylated. However, in cancer cell, firstly, CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes is hypermethylated in locus specific way, and secondly, other regions are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the hypermethylation of CpG islands and regions 2 kb surrounding CpG islands (upstream and downstream) called CpG island shores, is a very effective way of inactivating a tumor suppressor gene or a set of genes.</p>
<p>In normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements that mostly make up the genome, are heavy methylated and heterochromatinized that contribute to maintain genomic stability. In cancers, they became less methylated – hypomethylated, i.e. activated. Then, they can align or misalign, and an illegitimate recombination can occur because they are not packaged down in heterochromes. The activated repeats can copy themselves and jump around the genome or transpose. They can then disrupt the coding region of a gene and also activate neighboring genes.  The cryptic strong promoters are activated in some instances and also disrupt neighboring genes. All can lead to a genomic instability, including additional deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocation between chromosomes.</p>
<p>The other hypomethylation that less commonly occurs in CpG poor promoters can lead to activation of certain genes, microRNA (miR21) targeting tumor suppressor PTEN, i.e. less expression of PTEN eventually to no PTEN – no tumor suppressor.      </p>
<p>Such epimutation are rapidly selected for a particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissue. Over time, the epi-mutated cells are more likely to divide more rapidly or not to die. Therefore, they will therefore take over, and eventually, they will lead to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele, which is seen as the DNA methylation imprint on paternal chromosome. When the ICR on maternal allele is unmethylated, it is bound by a protein called CTCF as an insulator protein that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers, the Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, CTCF can no longer bind, there is no insulator action, the enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and promote Igf2´s expression for the paternal allele. Therefore, we have the imprint expression of Igf2 being a growth promoting gene.</p>
<p>If this imprinting is lost – hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele as well, the ICR on maternal allel cannot be bound by CTCF. Then, Igf2 will not be insulated from downstream enhancer, this expression from the maternal allele will also be enhanced. This will be up-regulation or double-dose of Igf2 to promote growth in comparison with a normal cell. Such hypermethylation of ICRs is a common and early event often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue. This is predisposed to embryonic or childhood tumors, but not adult tumors, e.g. Wilm´s tumor that is found in the kidney.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of nucleoside analogues - DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. Then, DNMT comes along to bind that nucleotide of the DNA in order to copy methylation to the daughter strand. But, that DNMT is bound irreversible and it can no longer be released, i.e. inhibited. Therefore, the DNMTi´s action is replication-dependent and seems to cause DNA demethylation. Cancer cells are often divide much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, they will thus be more severely affected. However, its mechanism of action is not clear because we still do not know much about the specificity of DNMTi. DNMTis were used in 70´s at very high doses to be really toxic, but have a very good anti-cancer effect. Recently, they have been used at much lower doses, but still effective in haematological magnilancies (MDS), probably because these are dependent on CpG island (tumor suppressor) gene hypermethylation. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is involved in a number of important processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and carcinogenesis. Alteration of DNA methylation can contribute to cancer through hypomethylation genomewide that causes chromosomal instability and loss of printing, and tumor suppressor hypermethylation that causes silencing tumor suppressor genes. Drugs that alter DNA methylation in cancers may have such effects in all sorts of other genes as well as in normal cells. Such effects can last beyond the period of drug treament because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one that is actually sensitive to environment changes and epigenetic control, i.e. period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and period of pre-implanted and early post implantation period. It involves an active remodelling of epigenetic marks, i.e. DNA methylation status – predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks including the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. Or simply saying it is when you still have germ cell maturation occurring, in certain childhood age, fetal and infant life, or pre-conceptional period. Therefore, it should be avoidable to treat the patients in such sensitive period, i.e. very young children or pregnant women because it may cause certain harmful epigenetic changes through DNA methylation alteration.</p></div>
