    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of normal DNA methylation patterns is an almost universal occurrence in cancer. CpG dinucleotides are under represented in the genome. They are mostly methylated with the exception of clusters of CpGs at gene promoters called CpG islands. The vast majority of DNA sequences are in intergenic regions and are heavily methylated in normal cells. DNA methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark and leads to silencing of the methylated region and to its compaction into heterochromatin. In intergenic regions, methylation leads to the silencing of repeats preventing transposition and transcriptional interference from cryptic promoters and helping prevent illegitimate recombinations which can lead to translocations, deletions and duplications. DNA methylation in these regions therefore helps maintain genomic stability and integrity and acts as a defence mechanism against transposable elements. It is therefore generally present in all cells and at all times. Methylation at CpG islands in contrast is not prevalent, and they are kept free even when it is desirable to silence the relevant genes.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is loss of this normal pattern of methylation. Loss of methylation (hypomethylation) of the intergenic regions occurs in almost all cancers to varying degrees. This leads to genomic instability, activation of repeats and of cryptic promoters. This genome wide hypomethylation occurs early and progresses with the cancer and can be a driving force for tumour progression, spread and metastasis. In contrast, hypermethylation occurs at and around CpG islands in tumour specific patterns leading to gene silencing. Such epigenetic silencing when affecting tumour supressor genes can act in a way analogous to their silencing by genetic mutations. It is a very frequent finding in most tumours and can be constitutive or confined to tumour tissues. Such epigenetic hits can be selected for and accumulated by developing cancer cells together with and in a way similar to genetic hits.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Differential methylation at ICRs between maternally and paternally derived chromosomes is central to imprinting, the parent of origin dependent expression of alleles. Methylation of an ICR can lead  to either expression or silencing of genes and often, in the region surrounding an ICR there will be genes that are silenced by its methylation, genes that require its methylation to be expressed and genes which are unaffected. In cancer, both inappropriate ICR methylation and loss of methylation occur leading to both chromosomes behaving as if derived from a single parent. This loss of imprinting occurs very early in cancer and can contribute to tumorigenesis as many imprinted genes are involved in regulating growth. An example is imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>H19 is maternally expressed and Igf2 is paternally expressed. These genes share enhancers and are separated by a CTCF-dependent insulator. Binding of CTCF occurs on the unmethylated maternal chromosome blocking the enhancers from accessing Igf2 and causing them instead to act exclusively on H19. Methylation on the paternal chromosome prevents CTCF binding allowing the expression of Igf2 and spreads to the H19 locus silencing it. Loss of imprinting found in Wilm's tumour leads to both chromosomes behaving as paternal. This favours tumorigenesis through overexpression of Igf2 (a growth factor) and under expression of H19 which inhibits growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The aberrant patterns of DNA methylation acquired by tumour cells during carcinogenesis can be accumulated and passed from a cell to its descendants because, like genetic mutations, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, being copied during DNA replication and passed down from cell to cell. Unlike genetic mutations, however, these changes are reversible and infact, patterns of DNA methylation are known to be reset during germ cell maturation and in early embryonic development. It is this possibility to reset a cell's DNA methylation status, with the changes persisting in the cell and its descendants that underlies the lure of epigenetic therapy for cancer. It is these very same properties that can make the effects of agents which target the epigenome particularly serious when they affect normal dividing cells, especially if this occurs during one of the sensitive periods described above when the methylation pattern of cells is being actively reprogrammed. This could lead to disruption of the establishment of normal methylation patterns with the aberrations being inherited by all descendants of an affected cell. This could interfere directly with embryogenesis and foetal development (interference with reprogramming during early development) or with gamete formation and imprinting (interference during primordial germ cell development)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog which can be incorporated into DNA strands where it binds and inhibits methyltransferases thereby interfering with maintenance methylation of replicated DNA and leading to passive demethylation with replication. This leads to hypomethylation and in tumours where hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters is a key driving force, can lead to reactivation of these tumour suppressor genes and mostly through them to anti-tumour effects.This means that it can be given at lower doses that interfere with methylation rather than with DNA replication in dividing cells and are therefore less toxic than the traditional cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy</p></div>
