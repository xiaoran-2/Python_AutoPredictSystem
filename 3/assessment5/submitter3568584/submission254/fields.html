    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation consists in the addition of a methyl group to DNA. This methylation is able to be maintained through cell division. Although this process occurs almost exclusively in CpG dinucleotides, CpG islands are oftenly not methylated, where intergenic regions and repetitive elements are oftenly methylated. When methylation does occur at CpG islands (often found at the promoters of genes), it leads to gene silencing. It's a most important proccess in epigenetics, regulating the activation of genes throghout the genome, leading to the wide cell type diversity and cell growth controll, among other not yet fully understanded functions. </p>
<p>Cancers are a very destructive and common desease that's been keeping scientists and medics occupied for a long while, and latelly epigenetics has been able to shed a small light at it. Studies showed that cancers can be consequences of mutations that turn the enzyme that methylates DNA<span> overactive, leading to hypermethylation of CpG islands and consequent inactivation of some surrounding genes that should be active, genes that regulate cell replication and death, thus leading to extended cell life and over replication, forming the tumours.</span></p>
<p>The DNA methylation also has a hole at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, here methylation occurs to maintain genomic integrity, by silencing some promoters that would cause transcption disrupting or interference, preventing illegitimate recombination or transposition, and other types of genomic instability.</p>
<p>In desease, if the CpG islands are hypermethylated instead of the usual hypomethylation, the subsequent ingergenic regions and repetitive elements are, on the opposite, not methylated, therefore causing genomic instabillity, leading to aberrant cell behavior.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed down in replication, from mother cell to daughter and grandmother cells, and so on, until they are actively erased. This means that if a drug does erase this epigenetic marks, they will no longer be replicated upon cell division, putting a stop to the deseas spreading. It's a way of stopping cancer growth, without having to kill all it's cells.</p>
<p>Although this drugs have shown to be very effective in cancer treatment, the possible long-term effects are hard to predict, since it will only act upon cell replication, and it would take some time untill enough replication occurs in healthy cells. That in mind, it's necessary to consider sensitive periods of development when this kind of treatment would be inadvisable. For instance, treating younger patients, who are like to be in high cell development rate. Since the epigenetic machinery is so important upon cell replication, the removal of epigenetic changes (by not allowing them to be replicated into daughter cells) could have very harmfull and unpredictable effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth. Loss of imprinting is a common feature for cancer.</p>
<p>For instance, methylation of imprint control region on maternal allele spreads foward and silences Kcnq1ot1, as the paternal allele imprint control region is not methylated, Kcnq1ot1 is active, recruiting other enzimes which will methylate the subsequent imprinted genes.<br />Cdkn1c is maternally expressed, cell cycle regulator, having the function of inhibitting growth, frequently called tumour supressor.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster envolves an interesting imprinting mechanism, by enhancer blocking. At this cluster, gene expression enhancers preferably act on Igf2 (instead of H19). But once the imprint control region is not methylated, it's bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein, which means it 'protects' the gene for Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, which are then free to act on H19, enhancing it's expression. Igf2 promotes growth.</p>
<p>Not rarely we found that the maternal allele is behaving like paternal allele, or the genome has two copies from the father allele. This means that with two ICR methylated patternal alleles and no maternal allele, you end up with no expression of Cdkn1c (growth inhibitor) and an enhanced expression of Igf2 (growth promoter).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the four epigeneticaly acting drugs that have been aproved so far for use and is already on the market. It's a DNA-demethylating drug, which can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />It belongs to the group of drugs that act on DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). These drugs get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.<br />As it is, this DNA methyltransferase inhibitors action is dependant on cell replication, it acts directly on cell division. That means cancer cells, which replicate a lot more than other cells, will be more severely affected. A small dosis of this drug can have a great anti-tumour effect.</p></div>
