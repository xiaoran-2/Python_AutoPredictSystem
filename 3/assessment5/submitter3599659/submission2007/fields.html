    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal DNA methylation occurs at the intergenic and the repetitive element regions; CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells.  In cancer cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. When promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated the relating genes controlled by that promoter are not activated. The silenced gene(s) could be a tumor supressor of an oncogene which leads to uncontrolled cell growth (or overgrowth), leading to cancer. In the same manner, when CpG islands are hypermethylated, the intergenic and repetitive element regions are not methylated it could lead to an overproduction of oncogenes; this "swap" methylation pattern can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methlyated and so the enhancers are free to act on Igf2, resulting in the expression of Igf2; on the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and is then bound by CTCF which allows H19 to be expressed and inhibits the enhancers from acting on Igf2, resulting in the silencing of Igf2. This occurs in a normal cell when only one allele is expressing Igf2. In the case of Wilm's tumor, both alleles (paternal and maternal) have methylated ICRs, leading to silencing of both H19 copies and a double dose expression of Igf2. The double dose expression of Igf2 leads to uncontrolled cell growth because Igf2 is growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Decitabine impacts DNA methylation by shutting down the overactive expression of genes that cause or that lead to the development of cancer. The shutting down of overactive genes slows the proliferation of tumor cells without change to surrounding cells. Overactive genes over methylates histones which leads to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes; therefore, with Decitabine's demethylating effects, tumor growth is slowed. The slowing of tumor growth could also help the treatment be more effective.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During cell division the epigenetic changes are continuously being passed on to the daughter cells of the next generations until they are permanently removed. If and when the drugs alter the tumor cells in an epigenetic way, without changing the surrounding normal/non-cancerous cells, those changes will be passed on; therefore, the epigenetic changes being passed on are "free" of tumor marks that previously had lead to the development of cancer. There is more caution given to the treatment of younger patients because sensitive periods need to be considered. The sensitive period is during primordial germ cell development.  </p></div>
