    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of promoter regions inverserly correlates with gene expression. Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found an about 60 % promoters. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. In cancer cell promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated wich then causes silencing on the underlying gene.</p>
<p> Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and also been detected in different tumor cell. Unussually high frequence of DNA methylation  at CpG rich sites was termed CIMP ( for CpG island methylator phenotype ). Where CpG islands of set of genes and are frequently methylated.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation include Genome - Wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation.</p>
<p> The most of the genome is made up of itergenic intervals of repetative elements or other places were in general CpG islands in normal cell are hypermethylated. Hypomethylated at CpG promoters are less common than hypomethylated of repeats can result in active genes. CpG poor promoters oncogene activation. Hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic intervals its repetative between genes wich lead to genomic instability . Illigitimate recombination between repeats. Activation of repeats of transcription and activation of cryptic promoters leads to desruption by neighbouring genes.Overexpression of satelite repeats inducating to disruption of heterohromatin and may result in genomic instability  in variety of human cancer. CpG promoters become hypomethylated in cancer.</p>
<p>Contribution of DNA methylation to cancer, Hypomethylation Genome - Wide and tumor suppressor hypermethylation. Driven by tumour hypermethylation, suppress tumorgenesis. Driven by chromosomal instability depletion of DNA methylation appears enhance tumorgenesis.</p>
<p>.Mutations in chromatin related enzymes such as DNMTs. Faulty targeting by RNA or transcription factors lead to global and change specific in the epigenetic signature. Changes in the spatio - temporal organisation of nuclear arhitecture or loss of boundaries might  cause altered epigenetic patterns and induce altered gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>Angelman syndrome. Caused by failure to express Ube3a. Commonly by deletion or inappripriate silencing of the maternal copy of 15q11-13. Deletion that removes AS - IC, leaves PWS - IC means PWS - IC  fails to be methylated in oocytes.  Somatic tissue have unmethylated PWS - IC on both alleles, no Ube3a in the brain. Uniparental disomy. Increased Airn expression , no effect on Slc22a1 expression, decreased Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Prader Willi syndrome. Commonly caused by deletion or inappropriate silencing of the paternal copy 15q11-13. Leads to no expression of paternally expressed genes within the cluster  (snoRNAs have a role in determining brain phenotype). Deletion of PWS - IC leads to maternal like allele (snrpn/snrpn  start site removed). Uniparental disomy. Decreased Airn expression, no effect on Slc22a1 expression, increased Igf2 .expression.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of ICRs - loss of imprinting. Alterations in DNA methylation Of ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes). common, early event often seen in pre neoplastic tissue. e.g. hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Willms tumour. Double dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>Backwith Wiedemann syndrome. Imprinted disorder, results from various abnormalities in linked Kcnq1 and H119/Igf2 clusters at 11q15.5 (1Mb). e.g loss of Cdkn1c (tumour suppressor, growth suppressing). e.g. upregulation of Igf2 (oncogene, growth promoting)..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr, Dhank treated lymphoma cells with newly develop inhibitor currently referred to by the unmemorable name GSK2816126. hystone deacetylase inhibitors. They found it also, reduces proliferation of tumour cells having no apperent effect on nearby normal cells. Decitabine Eisai a Japanese company are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia Decitabine works as substance that inhibit the activity on enzyme called EZH2. The enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins which are a part of chromosomal packaging. Such overactivity methylates histones more than they should be and thuse silencies the genes surround including so called tumour - suppressor genes whose job is to stop to uncontolled cell growth that causes cancer. Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors). Epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division to doughter and granddoughter cell untill they are actively passed. Once ereased through they do not return. Epigenetic terapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growthing without to kill all its cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern in question is that many of the genes whose breakage leads to cancer are themselves involved in a specific sort of genetic regulation  known as epigenetics. These switches genes on and off by plastering either  their DNA or the proteins which support  that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and atethyl groups. The nature of these reactions means epigenetic process are suscetible to chemical intrvention in a way that genetic mutations are not.  Sensitive period ( whith respect to epigenetic ) is a period of development suscetibile to envoirmental signals e.g. in vitro cullture. Its identify when oocytes remain vulnerable during childhood in femals, as epigenetic marks are not established in oocytes untill puberty. It is not inadvisable treating patients during sensitive perioid because the epigenome is most vulnerable to envoirmental insults during period of extensive epigenomic reprogramming such as early embrionic development. Sensitive period, younger patients those that have  developing germ cells. Still these drugs that are going to be used throughout the system untill every cell could has a potential to be effected by these drugs. One very large insults to the envoirment would be taking a drug that inhibits epigenetic machinery. </p></div>
