    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at the 5<sup>th</sup> carbon on the nucleotide cytosine within the CpG dinucleotide.   This occurs almost exclusively at a cytosine – guanine (CG) location (as opposed to AG TG) Methylation is maintained through cell division by enzymatic activity (methytranferases)   </p>
<p>CpG’s are clustered into CpG islands. Normally these regions are not methylated expect for the normal function of X chromosome inactivation and imprint control in early development.</p>
<p>In cancer, region specific methylation of CpG islands occurs (hypermethylation). When this occurs within the region of a tumor suppressor gene the gene will be silenced (through inactivation of the related promoter) giving the cell with a growth advantage likely leading to tumour development.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above, CpG’s are normally methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. The function of methylation at these locations is to silence repeats (by blocking the necessary enzymatic activity), to avoid transcriptional interference and illegitimate transposition (genomic stability).  In cancer these regions are hypomethylated and therefore the activity normally silenced will proceed leading to mutations and subsequence tumour risk.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated.  This methylation spreads to the H19 promoter.  These actions result in the inability of the insulator protein (CTCF) to bind and the silencing of the H19 promoter.  The LGf2 gene is therefore expressed as enhancers are free to act.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated and therefore is bound by insulator protein (CTCF).   This insulates igf2 and blocks the enhancers preferred loop to igf2 and therefore favours H19. </p>
<p>Should a disruption of the methylated state arise, say in the ICR region maternal allele (non methylated to methylated) both allele would behave as parental.  This could arise through mutation, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption.  The net result is that igf2 (which is growth promoting) is over expressed and cdkn1 (which is a tumour suppressor) under expressed leading to disease such as Wilm’s tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agents used to treat cancers associated with the myelodysplastic syndrome. This syndrome occurs when the controlled production of blood cells is disrupted leading to large number of immature red blood cells.  The disease is caused, in part, by the loss of tumor suppressor genes due to hypermethylation of specific DNA sequences.</p>
<p>Decitabine <span>inhibits DNA methyltransferase</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> </span><span style="font-size:14px;">which may lead to the restoration of normal methylation levels and the proper expression of tumour suppressors.  </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered methylation is an epigenetic change can be passed down from one generation to the next. Methyl groups can be added (hypermethylated) or subtracted (hypomethylated) and the changes are inheriteted. It is thought that this occurs as the result of incomplete clearing of the altered methyhl marks during sensitive periods of development; reprogramming during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic pre-implantation. These marks are then carried though into the next generation.</p>
<p>Treating an individual during sensivitive periods may leave permanent changes that will be carried throughout the life of the individual.  In the case of methylation, this would result in hypo/hpypermethylation depending upon the agent.  Furthermore, these changes may be passed to offspring as there is evidence that the altered methyl marks are heritable.</p></div>
