    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>GpC islands are typically unmethylated in healthy cells, but in the few cases when the CpG islands are methylated, the methylation of the CpG islands lead to the repression of the downstream gen. However, given that there are other several epigenetic marks regulating the gene expression (such as histone modifications), the lack of methylation does not ensure the expression of the gene.</p>
<p>In the tumor cells the CpG islands are predominantly methylated. This alteration helps the tumor cells to avoid the activation of several genes, such as the tumor suppressor genes, contributing to the proliferative state.</p>
<p>CpG islands are not the only place where it is possible to find CpG dimers. There are also CpG dimers spread over the genome. This dimers are predominantrly methylated in healthy cells, and this methylated state is very important for silencing the repetitive fragments, like the transposons that could lead to genomic alterations. In tumor cells, the CpG dimers get unmethylated, leading to the genomic instability that usually tumor cells show.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control regions (ICR) play also a role in the development of some types of cancer. The imprinted region that control the expression of H12 and Igf2 is a good example of that. In this region, there are some promoters downstream of the H19 locus. In the maternal allele of healthy cells, the transcriptional repressor CTCF binds to a region upstream of the H19 locus and avoids the action of the enhancers in the Igf2 locus and allows the action of the enhancers in the H19 locus.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the paternal allele was inherited with a strong methylation in the region where the CTCF repressor binds. This decreases the affinity of this region to the CTCF allowing the effect of the enhancers in the Igf2 locus. <br /> There is a lack of imprinting in this ICR in the Wilm´s tumor. This cells show a strong methylation in the maternal ICR increasing the expression Igf2, and contributing to the proliferative state of the tumor.</p>
<p>This is not the only case where this happens. Several ICR have been seen disrupted in different cancers, either increasing the expression of proliferative factors or decreasing restricting genes, associated with ICR´s.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The 'Decitabine' drug is used for the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndromes. It inhibits the action of the DNA methyltransferases, which are the enzimes that introduce methyl groups into the genome. The loss of these epigenetic marks contributes to stabilizing the genome deleting the tumor epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>The therapeutical effect could be mediated by the inhibition of the DNA methyltranferase 1, which responsible for the maintenance of the DNA methylation state over the next cell generations. Decitabine binds the DNA as a nucleotide analog. When DNMT1 is going to methylate it, it gets blocked. Inhibiting this DNMT1 this way, the next generation of cells won´t display the marks that are leading to the tumor phenotype in the prior generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Stephen Baylin´s experiments seems to be related with the stability of the epigenetic changes. That is the reason why he found some effect after finishing the treatment with the epigenetic modifier. This changes can lead to the sensitization of the tumor to other cytostatic drugs.</p>
<p>According to this we also have to take into account the fact that there are some periods during the lifespan that are particularly sensitive to the epigenetic alterations, such as de early development or during the germ cells production (i.e. periods of time where de epigenetics marks are being actively established). Using these drugs during these periods could lead to long term disorders and safety evaluations should be perfomed before using these therapies in this people.</p></div>
