    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>One  common features of  cancer cells is that they diplay loss of imprinting, that is, genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression.</p>
<p>One specific example of hypermethylation at an imprint control region is the Igf2/H19 cluster.</p>
<p>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, and it’s unmethylatd on the maternal allele. When it’s unmethylated CTCF4 bind act as an insulator element, so that the Enhancers in this case will act on H19. But Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don’t see expression.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, the Enhancers can now act on Igf2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, you loose this imprinting with hypermethylation on the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele. You therefore also have expression of  Igf2 on the maternal allele.This leads to a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell.</p>
<p>Igf2 is  growth promoting. and  having a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell  is associated with Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention, ie drug therapy, in a way that genetic mutations are not.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMT).</p>
<p>The role of DNA Methylation is context dependent, different tumors have different dependencies. Some tumors, eg. some haematological malignancies, are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation. In these tumors depletion of DNA methylation, using a DNMT like decitabine appears to suppress tumorigenesis<em>.</em></p>
<p>Nucleoside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMT’s after they are incorporated into DNA, they are therefore, replication dependent. Although the mechanism of action is not known, in these cases, tumor suppressor hypermethylation  is reduced allowing the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed to a greater extent. It is also possible that the epigenetic hypermethylation reduction is passed to the tumor’s daughter cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>There are two main periods. The first is all the time from primordial germ cell development right up to the production of mature eggs and sperm. The other sensitive period is the pre implantation to early post implantation period.</p>
<p>Both of these are periods of active remodelling of the whole genome, removal then laying down of the epigenetic marks at different places in the genome.</p>
<p>The first sensitive period appears to be more sensitive to environmental influences.</p>
<p>Other sensitive periods occur briefly for individual organs and systems as they differentiate.</p>
<p>It has been shown that there can be transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes, that is the inheritance of phenotypes or gene expression patterns from parent to offspring by passage through the germ cells, that are not explained by genetic differences.</p>
<p>One suggested method for the transgenrational epigenetic inheritance is that there is incomplete epigenetic reprogramming. </p></div>
