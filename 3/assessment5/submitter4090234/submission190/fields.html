    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells , we can find hypomethylation of CpG islands. so the tumor repressor genes are transcriped and activated normally. in contrast , we can see hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells more than normal cells.we know in most cases , hypermethylation of CpG causes silencing and when we look at where the CpG islands are found, they're in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. so hypermethylation cause silencing of tumor suppressor genes causing cancer.but you should have multiple hits in order to have a cancer to occur.this causes particular cell to have a competitive advantage over the others in the surrounding tissues. this cell will have the ability to divide more so that we think how the cancer occur. on the other hand, in contrast we can find in normal cells hypermethylation in intergenic regions and repititve elements. these methylation assure the genomic stability and prevent the transcription of repetitive elements. but in case of Cancer cells we can find hypomethylation in these places causing transcription and activation of repetitive elements and genomic instability due to transposition. aslo can cause  activation of neighbouring genes like the agouti gene or axin gene .and also illegitimate recompination between repeats can occur like reciprocal translocation between different chromosomes due to open chromatin because of hypomethylation. so the final reult will be that we can have in cancer cells deletion , insertion or reciprocal translocation. so in general , genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprinting regions can cause cancer by diruption of imprinting  causing expression from both parents or no expression at all.because mostof imprinted genes are responsible for growth promoting or growth supression. for example, in normal cells , the paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster show methylation in imprinted control region causing expression of IGf2 and no expression of H19. on the other hand, in mother allele no methylation in imprinted control region causingno expression of IGf2 and  expression of H19. in wilm 's tumor..there 's hypermethylation in case of maternal allele causing expression of Igf2 gene from maternmal and paternal allele. so now you have a double dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting causing wilm 's tumor which is particular childhood kidney genome. by logic , due to high level of Igf2, there will be more growth of the cells in comparison to normal cells causing the tumor to appear. but this is an early event so it 's often seen in preneoplastic tissues before you decide it 's actually frank tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agents "decrease methylation" which is sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company. it belongs to  the class of DNA methyltransferase inhinitor. it 's used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. it 's nucleoside analogue which binds irreversibly to DNMT after incorboration into DNA which means it needs replication. so cancer cells will be affected more by the drug because they are replicating more. it specificlly treats myelodysplastic because this tumor depends on CpG islands hypermethylation. so by using demethylating agent like Decitabine we can treat this tumor.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome because it can causes change in some gene expression by activating or deactivating some genes according to the type of the cell. it also affects gene stability if there 's hypomethylation of repitive elements. so if we treat a patient with a drug that changes DNA methylation during sensitive period , it will affect his whole life because it will lasts . because Sensitive period is the period at which the epigenitic reprogramming occurs (<span>A period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.). it happens during </span>the perimordial germ cell development (PGC development) and early development (pre_implantation period). if you treat the patients with somethings that change the epigenetics, it will be a problem because the <span>effects will last beyond the period of drug treatment and maybe transfered to offsbrings by affecting the gem cells. so one very large insult to the invironment would be taking a drug that inhibits epigenetic machinary.</span></p></div>
