    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, there is no DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGIs).  However, in cancer cells, there is a greater likelihood of DNA methylation at CGIs, which is called CGI hypermethylation.</p>
<p>CGI hypermethylation occurs in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.  Cancer cells are able to inactivate tumour suppressor genes epigenetically through silencing of the tumour suppressor gene.  Consequently, the gene is locked into a silent inactive state.  As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, it is therefore a very effective way of silencing the tumour suppressor gene.</p>
<p><strong></strong>In normal cells, there is DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  However, in cancer cells, there is no DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which is called hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repetitive elements (repeats) and intergenic regions creates genomic instability.  This allows illegitimate recombination of repeats to occur such as reciprocal translocation between chromosomes.  This would not happen in a normal cell as the repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatinised.  Hypomethylation can also result in repeats being activated to make copies of themselves and be transposed through the genome, which can lead to disruption of a coding region of a gene or activate neighbouring genes if the repeats are upstream of these cryptic promoters.  Therefore, there are aberrations in transcription in the surrounding regions.  Consequently, additional deletions and insertions in chromosomes may occur causing genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR on the paternal allele is normally methylated so the enhancers can act on Igf2 as the CTCF insulator element can't bind to the ICR, which results in expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>The ICR on the maternal allele is normally unmethylated so the CTCF insulator element can bind to the ICR, so the enhancers act on H19 as Igf2 is silenced so there is no Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, there is loss of imprinting on the maternal allele due to hypermethylation of the ICR, which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2, thereby causing Igf2 expression to occur.  This leads to overexpression of Igf2 from both alleles as there is now a double-dose of Igf2 compared with a normal cell.  Note that Igf2 is a growth promoter, which is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  It is a nucleoside analogue that gets incorporated into DNA upon replication.  The DNMT comes along to bind the nucleotide to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT and is bound irreversibly to Decitabine and can no longer be released for further DNA methylation and silencing of tumour suppressor genes.  Therefore, there is a more severe effect on cancer cells as they are dividing more quickly in the body, resulting in an anti-tumour effect.  Low doses of Decitabine has been shown to demethylate DNA more effectively than large doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as it is mitotically heritable in daughter cells.  Mitotic heritability of epigenetic state ensures that the same sets of genes are expressed in daughter cells, as well as ensuring tissue homogeneity, thereby maintaining cell identity. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods in the maternal and paternal genomes are when epigenetic reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during early embryonic development (after fertilisation) and primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis), when epigenetics marks are being cleared and reset.  Epigenetic reprogramming can also occur after artifical reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) (De Carvalho et al., 2010).</p>
<p>The use of epigenetic drugs has the potential to affect every cell in the body.  Therefore, it is not advisable to treat younger patients during sensitive periods when their germ cells are developing, i.e primordial germ cell development.</p></div>
