    <div class="field-value"><blockquote class="gmail_quote"><div>The methylation of DNA in the genome, and especially the alterations in its state, has been shown to play an integral part in cancer.<br />In normal, unaffected tissue the CpG Islands display hypomethylation compared to the overall methylation-state of the genome; the CpGs display no distinct methylation. In cancer however, the methylation of CpG Islands differs. During cancer CpG Island methylation is disrupted, leading to hypermethylation.<br /> This disruption of the conventional CpG methylation patterns leads to silencing of genes under the influence of these CpG islands. Frequently, genes that are affected by CpG hypomethylation belong to the class of tumor suppressor genes. The bypomethylation of the CpG islands in the vicinity of these tumor suppressor genes, leads to their inhibition. Such an inhibition ultimately leads to uncontrolled growth of cells, effectively contributing to the formation of a tumor.<br /> Intergenic regions and repetitive elements and especially their methylation states are also involved in cancer. Commonly, these region are both hypermethylated in order to ensure genomic stability. These genomic regions harbor transposable elements and cryptic promoters and are silenced due to their hypermethylated state.<br /> In cancer however, these regions become hypomethylated. In effect, this allows the transposable elements in these regions to transpose themselves into other parts of the genome. This can be disastrous for the steady-state of the cell, as a transposon that places itself in another genomic region can disrupt one or more genes and their function, possibly leading to cancer.<br /> Alternatively, the hypomethylation of long repeats in the genome can lead to chromosomal recombination, by opening up the chromatin and making the repeats accessible. Recombination can also lead to erroneous expression of genes and ultimately cancer.<br /> Lastly, hypomethylation can also lead to the activation of cryptic promoters, which might be able to express genes involved in cancer.</div></blockquote>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote class="gmail_quote"><div>Disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer, as can be seen in the example of the H19?Igf2 cluster.<br /> Commonly, the paternal allele is the allele responsible for the expression of Igf2. In this allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylation. This prevents the insulator CTCF from binding the ICR and drives the Enhancer-mediated expression of Igf2 as well as inhibits the expression of H19.<br /> The maternal allele on the other hand is not methylated at the ICR. The insulator CTCF is therefore able to bind and the enhancers drive the expression of H19.<br />In Wilm's tumor, the disruption of imprinting contributes to disease. In this case, the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is also methylated at the ICR. This effectively changes the maternal allele to behave as a paternal allele and therefore also expressed Igf2, in stead of H19.<br /> Igf2 is a growth factor that, when overexpressed/present in a high dosage, can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells susceptible to Igf2. This is exactly what occurs in Wilm's tumor, where disrupted imprinting leads to cancer.</div></blockquote></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that can be used to threat certain forms of cancer. It is a DNA demethylating agent that works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. This means that Decitabine effectively leads to lower levels of methylation. This includes demethylation of hypermethylated CpG Islands in cancer and reversal of the inhibition these have on tumor suppressor genes.<br /> At the appropriate dosage, Decitabine works by incorporating itself into the DNA. If a DNA methyltransferase tries to methylate DNA intercalated with Decitabine, it is irreversibly bound. This prevents the DNA methyltransferase from methylating further DNA bases. This action is division dependent and as cancer cells divide rapidly and more often than healthy cells, cancer cells are affected more severely. This could reduce the tumor growth-rate.<br /> At high dosage, Decitabine is very toxic and leads to cell-death, which could be helpful in reducing tumor-size.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are certain periods in which it would not be beneficial to treat patients with epigenetic drugs.<br />First of all, it is important to remember that epigenetic drugs have a systemic effect; they act on all cells in the body, not just the cancer cells. Secondly, epigenetic changes are both mitotically and meiotically heritable. This means that changes in the mother-cell are passed on to the daughter-cell, whether it is dividing through mitosis or meiosis.<br /> It is also important to know that there are sensitive periods, in which there is active remodeling of the epigenome (either removing or adding epigenetic marks).<br />There are two sensitive periods; first, the period of primordial germ cell development, including to the production of mature eggs and sperm. Second, the pre-implanted and early post implantation period.<br /> Considering this, treating a patient during a sensitive period can have grave and long-lasting effects. Cells are highly susceptible to epigenetic reprogramming during this period and epigenetic drugs might do more harm than good in promoting or inhibiting certain aspects of the epigenetic machinery during this period. Such changes would be passed on to daughter-cells and therefore can have an effect even after the initial drug treatment. In young patients, this is far from ideal.</p></div>
