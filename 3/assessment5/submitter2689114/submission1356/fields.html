    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>in normal cell, the CpG island is hypomethylated and the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements throught the intergenic regions and indeed, even in the introns of genes as shown here, in cancer cell the CpG island are more likely to be methylated, they're not all methylated but their more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell, and the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements, and these intergenic elements and indeed the introns are hypomethylated, the CpG island are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes by the way epigenetically can silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in acyl in inactive state, the DNA methylation can be the second hit or one of the hits to silent the tumor suppressor gene when in terms of the knudson hypothesis , so DNA methylation (CpG island hypermethylation) is a consequent of epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes which is very frequently in tumors, the bio-marker of hypomethyleted or hpermethylated gene are useful to detect the diagnosis of disease it could be useful for prognostic decisions,so hypermethylation of this micro-RNA gene is associated with metastasis,sofar is hypermethylation single biomarkers of hypermethylation can predict the treatement</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>display loss of imprinting genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, is found in cancer is probably because lots of gene that are imprinted are involved in growth ,either tey're growth promoting or growth suppressing,so we don't exclusively find hypermethylation of imprint control regions in cancer.you can find hypomethylation of imprint controls regions, and this depend on the particular imprint control regions you're looking at and the function of the genes that are found within the control region.the IGF2/H19 cluster is the imprint control region shown as the oval and it is methylated on the paternel allele, and it's unmethyleted on the maternel allele, when it's unmethylated CTCF4 bind is insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19 but IGF2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so we don't see expression on the paternal allele is methylated,the enhancer act on IGF2 ,CTCF is not binding to intulate this, and IGF2 on the maternal allele you have expression of IGF2 double dose compred with normal cell it is associated with Wilm's tumour IGF2 is both growth promoting </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine is an analogue of cytidine deoxynucleotide,low doses, selectively inhibit the DNA methyltransferases resulting from hypomethylation promoter of the gene that may result in reactivation of tumor suppressor genes in induction of cell differentiation, cell senescence or programmed cell death, so decitabine is DNA methyltransferses inhibitors they get incorprated into DNA upon replication and when DNA methltransferases comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferases is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released and this means that the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have the cell replicating the cancer cells are dividing much more rapidly than most other cell in the body</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the younger patient that have developing germ cells in sensitive periods, the sensitive period so that one very large insulit to the environment would be taking a drug that inhibits the epigenetic machinery</p></div>
