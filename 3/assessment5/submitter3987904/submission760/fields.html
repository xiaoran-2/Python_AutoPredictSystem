    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, methylation is esential for important processes such as gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin. In the CpG islands, the methylation is usually absent independently if there is gene expression or not. </p>
<p>But in cancer cells, the CpG islands show a high degree of methylations, they are hypermethylated and this phenomenon causes that the underlying gene get silenced. When the CpG island is associated with a tumour suppressor gene and this gene is silenced, the cell is likely to become a cancer cell.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it occurs inversely. Since repetitive elements are involved in recombination events between regions in DNA with high identity, the methylation in repetitive elements blocks undesirable (illegitimed) recombination in these regions by the highly condensed state of DNA. In cancer cells, hypomethylation in repetitive elements contributes to cancer by leading to genomic instability. This is evidenced when deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations events occur in the krayotype of a cancer cell. Other mechanisms by which genomic instability can take place is by activation of repeats and transposition and by activation of cryptic promoters and disrupting to neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, ICR (imprinted control region) is methylated in the patternal allele blocking the binding of CTCF and permitting the enhancers to act over Igf2 so this is expressed. And, on the other hand, in the maternal allele, the ICR (unmethylated) can be bound to CTCF and H19 can be expressed, but, enhancers do not act over Igf2. This is the imprinted one. However, in a cancer cell, there is loss of imprinted genes by hypermethylation, and in this case, the ICR in the maternal allele is methylated just like in the paternal allele and there is a huge amount of Igf2 expressed, so there will be a double dose of this growth promoter and then, an overgrowth in the cell. Phenotypically, this is the cause of the Wilm tumour, which is manifested in kidneys of children with this genotype.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is utilized to <span> to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the which in turn, are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </span></p>
<p><span>This drug may contribute to counteract hypermethylation in genetic regions that causes overgrowth. </span></p>
<p>So It could be used on childred with Wilm tumour to demthylate the maternal allele of the ICR Igf2/H19 </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation may produce enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable and the daughter cell inherits the changes in sensitive periods.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is not made evenly in all cells at all time, there are periods when the epigenome is more stable and when it is reprogrammed in the cells. These are the sensitive periods when the epigenetic marks are re-written and the epigenome is sensitive to changes and epimutations.The sensitive periods along development are that of during the early embryo development and during primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>So during this two times, a treatment with epigenetic drugs may alter the epigenome to the extent of causing undesirable effects (epigenetic mutations, por instance) that could lead to a syndrome or disease. That's why an epigenetic drug treatment may not be recommendable.</p></div>
