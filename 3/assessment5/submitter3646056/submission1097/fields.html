    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands' methylation is low at promoters, and this allows proper gene expression. However, in cancer, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation occurs at tumour suppressor genes promoters, so this silences the expression of these genes and contributes to the progress of cancer. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands may activate the expression of certain oncogenes. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, because these regions need to be in heterochromatized regions in order to provide genomic instability. In cancer, DNA at these regions is demethylated, which causes the chromatin to open and this makes that processes such as illegitimate recombination and transposition are more likely to occur. In conclusion, the role of DNA methylation is context dependent, as some regions that are normally demethylated become methylated in cancer cells, and viceversa.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the insulator site between H19 and Igf2 is methylated, which prevents the binding of the insulator protein CTCF. The H19 promoter is also methylated, so the downstream promoter binds to the Igf2 promoter and this gene is active. On the other hand. in the maternal allele, CTCF is bound to the insulator sequence and this prevents the enhancer to bind with the Igf2 promoter, so the enhancer binds to the H19 promoter and the transcription of this gene is activated. In Wilm's tumour, the insulator sequence and the promoter of H19 in the maternal allele become methylated, so the expression pattern resembles that of the paternal allele. CTCF is unable to bind the insulator and the enhancers bind to the Igf2 promoter, so there is an overall overexpression of Igf2 (which is a growth factor) and silencing of H19.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Its use as a medicine would decrease the overall level of DNA methylation. This has certain aspects that need to be considered. DNMT inhibitors irreversibly bind DNMTs, they have a lack of specificity and they may have long term effects in the organism. In those cases that cancer is due to the silencing of tumour supressor genes, Decitabine might help by indirectly activating the expression of these useful genes. However, it might be harmful in those types of cancer that are caused by genomic instability, as Decitabine would promote the demethylation of repetitive elements and illegitimate recombination and transposition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation might have enduring effects on the epigenome because changes in DNA methylation may alter the expression of some elements of the epigenetic machinery. It is complicated to predict the effects that epigenetic drugs may have in tumour cells, because different types of cancer have different causes and distinct mechanisms. A sensitive period is when the cell is undergoing some changes on the epigenome fundamental to its development. The epigenetic reprogramming during primordial germ cell development and the gametogenesis are some examples of sensitive periods. It would be unadvisable to treat patients during these periods because epigenetic drugs, such as DNMTs inhibitors, would alter the mechanism in which the neccessary epigenetic reprogamming is being done. This is a crucial proccess, because methylation at certain regions such as Imprinted Control Regions have to be carefully regulated, alterations in this proccess might be fatal.</p></div>
