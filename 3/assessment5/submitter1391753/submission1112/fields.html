    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is for silencing of gene expression. It is necessary for proper embryogeneis and development. It helps to inactivate imprinted genes and genes on the X chromosome and to maintain genomics stability, telomere length and predetermined gene expression states. It also acts as a defense against expression of foreign DNA such as viral or parasitic DNA elements in the cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, however, DNA methylation patterns changes. A regional gain of DNA methylation typically involves normally unmethylated CpG enriched island residing in and around gene promoter is common. </p>
<p>High frequency of DNA methylation at CpG island within promoters decreases expression of tumor suppressor proteins that could suppress tumorigenesis as well as cell adhesion molecules and growth-regulatory proteins that are for regulating normal cell growth, differentiation, and DNA repair.</p>
<p>Besides, aberration in DNA methylation at the imprinted gene CpG islands can result in silencing of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. Inactivation of these genes results in genomics stability, facilitating cancer development.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is for maintaining genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites as well as repetitive elements to prevent transposition, transcription interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are frequently hypomethylated. This causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring gene, resulting in genome instability facilitating cancer development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In imprint genes, either one from mom or dad is epigenetically silenced by methylation. Improper imprinting can result in activation or inactivation of two copies of the gene, leading to cancer. One example is H19/IGF2 imprinted locus. In the maternal locus, the IGF2 gene is silenced. In the paternal locus, IGF2 gene dominantly expressed. This H19/IGF2 locus shares enhancer that located on the H19 side and imprinted control region (ICR) that is located between H19 and IGF2 genes and is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator.</p>
<p>On the maternally allele, CTCF binds to ICR, generating an insulator that prevents IGF2 from accessing the shared enhancers. Therefore, CTCF block the expression of IGF2 activated by enhancers. On the paternal allele, the H19 promoter and the ICR are methylated preventing the binding of CTCF to ICR, allowing IGF2 to engage the enhancers for expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the silent maternal IGF2 allele is found to be frequently activated owing to the hypermutation of ICR and H19 promoter. This causes activation of both maternal and paternal IGF2.</p>
<p>IGF2 plays roles in development and growth as well as preventing apoptosis.  A double does of IGF2 leads to interfere with the normal balance of apoptosis and differentiation, facilitating cancer development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a dexoy derivative of the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacitidine (5-aza-CR). It is a inhibitor of DNA methylation. 5-aza-CR and decitabine are nucleoside analogs that get incorporated into the DNA of the rapidly growing tumor cells during replication and inhibit DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferase onto the DNA, leading to their depletion inside the cell. Therefore, decitabine reduces DNA methylation causing growth inhibition in cancer cells by activating tumor suppressor genes aberrantly silenced in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation by DNA demethylating agent such as decitabine can alter the tumors cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to chemotherapy. Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation by trapping DNA methyltransferase onto the DNA, resulting in a progressive loss of DNA methylation with each round of cell division. Therefore, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. As a result, epigenetic therapies have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is the period of early development of blastocyts and the period of germ cell development. That means the period of early stage of pregnancy (early development of blastocyts) and the period before maturation of reproductive organ (germ cell development).</p>
<p>In these periods, application of DNA demethylating therapies can disrupt epigenetic reprogramming, resulting in epigenetic abnormalities in the offspring. Therefore, pregnant women in the early stage of pregnancy and the children and teenagers are not advised for epigenetic therapies. </p></div>
