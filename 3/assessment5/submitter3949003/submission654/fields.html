    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">In normal cells, CpG islands, CpG-rich regions found in 60% of gene promoters, are usually unmethylated, allowing chromatin in that region to be in a euchromatic state and available for (but not necessarily engaging in) transcription. In cancer cells, the DNA in such CpG islands is often found to be hypermethylated in a locus specific manner for different types of tumours, which renders particular chromatin regions unavailable for transcription and heterochromatic. Since silencing genes, such as those which are normally growth/tumour suppressing, allows (in combination with other mutations/epimutations) a failure to normally regulate processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA repair; these DNA methylation changes are heritable and often selected for, such alterations in the epigenome can contribute to cancer development. Silencing of tissue-specific genes and deregulation of imprinted genes by CpG island hypermethylation also contributes to cancer development. This hypermethylation phenomenon, known as CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) correlates with tumour progression and metastatic potential and can be used in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and in deciding on treatment.</p>
<p class="Body1"> </p>
<p class="Body1">In contrast to CpG islands, the DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells tends to be hypermethylated. This maintains such regions in a condensed heterochromatic state and so prevents the genomic instability which would occur if these chromatin regions were more open and free to pair with other repeats, or transpose to other locations. However, a hallmark of cancer progression is a genome-wide hypomethylation which, like CGI hypermethylation, progresses with tumorigenicity; hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions allows chromatin decondensation, illegitimate recombination between repeats producing the accumulation of deletions, duplications and translocations; it also allows the activation of transposons and cryptic promoters; all this contributes to both genomic instability and abnormal patterns of gene expression in adjacent regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">Locus specific changes in DNA methylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs) can lead to the disruption of normal imprinting, for example, hypermethylation of the ICR in the Igf2 growth promoter gene leads to Igf2 overexpression and the development of Wilm's tumour:</p>
<p class="Body1"> </p>
<p class="Body1">There is normally a paternal expression pattern of imprinting of the Igf2/H19 cluster. (H19 is a long noncoding lncRNA downstream of the Igf2 gene.) The ICR of the paternal allele is normally methylated, which blocks binding of CTCF protein, and allows methylation to spread to the H19 promoter, inhibiting the transcription of H19. This, in turn, allows further downstream enhancers to loop and enhance Igf2 expression from the paternal allele.</p>
<p class="Body1"> </p>
<p class="Body1">In the normally unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF can bind to the ICR, H19 is expressed and the enhancers are prevented from interacting with Igf2, shutting off its expression.</p>
<p class="Body1"> </p>
<p class="Body1">In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele ICR is hypermethylated, resulting in both paternal and maternal alleles expressing Igf2, producing a double dose of this growth promoter/oncogene. This disruption of normal imprinting would be one of the "hits" or stochastic events leading to tumour formation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors which are DNA-demethylating agents, acting as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It has been approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML. It is a nucleoside analogue which, when incorporated into DNA, binds DNMT irreversibly, thereby blocking DNA methylation. Such DNMT inhibitors rely on the higher rate of cell division in cancer cells since they are incorporated during rounds of DNA synthesis. It is possible that they have their anti-cancer effect via demethylating the CpG islands that are found to be hypermethylated in AML and associated with poor prognostic outcomes. If these previously hypermethylated genes are tumour suppressors, by removing the hypermethylation this drug may be restoring tumour suppression in all cells descended from the drug affected cancer cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark which can be mitotically heritable and therefore can be stably passed on to all daughter cells from a particular parent cell. This is accomplished by an enzyme DNMT1 which recognizes and methylates the newly synthesized strand of hemimethylated DNA. Thus cancer cells which can be epigenetically altered will pass this alteration on to daughter cells even after the treatment period.</p>
<p class="Body1"> </p>
<p class="Body1">There are two major sensitive periods: during early blastocyst to epiblast development in the embryo, and later during the formation of primordial germ cells, when epigenetic marks such as methylation are removed and new epigenetic marks are laid down in the tissue-specific patterns of somatic cells and sperm/oocytes. During these sensitive periods the epigenome is particularly susceptible to changes from external agents, and so it would be inadvisable to treat cancer in pregnant women with such agents, because of the risk of producing abnormalities in the fetus and even in the patient's grandchildren due to effects on the primordial germ cells in the fetus. One should also be cautious in treating young children with such agents, since their germ cells are still undergoing maturation. However, patient survival is more important.</p>
