    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" style="text-align:center;" xml:lang="en-us"> </p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span>DNA methylation is usually connected with silencing of the gene expression. CpG islands - regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites are found in coding region or in the promoters of genes. When in a promoter, the CpG islands are normally unmethylated. This is ensures the normal expression of the corresponding gene.</span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In cancer cells the CpG islands in promoters are hypermethylated and the corresponding genes – silenced. If these genes are involved in DNA regulation and cell growth and death the cell may start an unregulated growth.</span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In cells of a tumor a genome wide hypomethylation and specific hypermethylation of is observed. This results in genome instability and a change in gene expression. The hypermethylation of  CpG islands in promoters of the genes makes their genes  silenced. High frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites (termed CIMP) was identified in colorectal cancer and other like glioma or breast cancer.</span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Intergenic regions belong to the noncoding DNA. Often they don't have known function but can interfere the nearby genes. Repetitive elements are parts of the DNA which are found in multiple copies in genome. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell which prevents these elements to be used for  transcription and to provoke instability.</span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The genome-wide hypomethylation usual for cancer means that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated too. This may cause activation of promoters found there and as a result the expression of the nearby regions may be changed. The hypomethylation of IGR and repetitive elements is a symptom of a cancer in the tissue.</span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Hypomethylation of repetitive elements is more significant as repetitive elements if they become active may make copies of themselves. The unmethylated repetitive elements may provoke recombination.  The following insertions and/or deletions disrupt the integrity of DNA and cause genomic instability. This instability is a cause of the appearance and the progression of cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Igf2 and H19 genes on chromosome 7 are reciprocally imprinted. Igf2 is activated on the paternal chromosome and H19 is activated on the maternal chromosome. This is done by methylation of <span>Igf2 <span>on the maternal allele and <span>unmethylation on the <span>paternal </span>allele and <span>methylation of </span></span></span></span>H19 on the paternal allele, and unmethylation on the maternal allele. This way <span>Igf2 is expressed on the <span>paternal chromosome while <span>H19 on the <span>maternal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> <span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">In Wilm’s tumour cells the normal imprinting of Igf2 and H19 is disturbed and the maternal chromosome uses a paternal type of expression with <span>Igf2 </span>activated on, and H19 deactivated. H19 is known as a tumor suppressor gene and it's deactivation causes increased cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine is a new cancer medicine with a commercial name Dacogen. Decitabine is an demethylation or hypomethylating agent which inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and this way decreases methylation. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The anti-tumour effect is caused by decreasing methylation of the tumor suppressing genes and restoring their function at one hand and by its antimetabolitic effect which causes death of the rapidly dividing cancer cells on the other hand.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Epigenentic changes can be transferred during cell division and this way mytoticaly inherited. This way drugs which affect methylation can prolong its effect after the period in which they are taken. But there are periods descrived as sensitive periods in development. These are development of primordial germ cells and preimplantation and postimplantation periods. </span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span>During sensitive periods the epigenetic marks in cells are erased and build again. During that period the enviroment has much more epigenentic effect and treatment with drugs that alter methylation can be dangerous.</span></span></p></div>
