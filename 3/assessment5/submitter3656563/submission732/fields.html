    <h1>Submission 732 from Anon (session_user_id: f02a81a109fe24fafbedf5e359465f622d3b1458)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT1 inhibitor, used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine acts a nucleoside analogue, replacing C in DNA strands. Once incorporated into DNA, Decitabine binds DNMT1, blocking its action. This causes cells that have taken it up to become hypomethylated due to the fact that newly replicated hemi-methylated DNA can no longer be methylated. While the specific molecular mechanism is unclear, it appears that the hypomethylation caused by Decitabine counteracts the CpG island hypermethylation that can occur with MDS. This has an anti-tumor effect because CpG island hypermethylation can silence tumor-suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. This is a necessary feature because cells that divide need to transfer information, such as cell type, to their daughter cells. Methylation is maintained by DNMT1, a methyltransferase which acts on hemi-methylated DNA. Thus, once a cell's DNA methylation is altered by medication, the methylation pattern is passed on to all its subsequent progeny. The epigenetic drugs that are currently available are not specific actors, only affecting cancerous cells, but instead affect methylation throughout the whole genome. Due to this, it would be inadvisible to give the drugs to patients who are in a sensitive period of development. Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic marks are being set up in the genome. This happens during the early development, when the epigenetic marks are removed from both the maternal and paternal genome and reset so that cells have pluripotency. A sensitive period also occurs when epigenetic marks are removed and reset during primordial germ cell development. If the normal methylation patterns are disrupted by a drug, there can be widespread negative effects.</p></div>

<div>In cancer, DNA is both hypermethylated in some areas and hypomethylated in others. Most CpG islands found in gene promoters are not methylated. However when they are methylated, the genes associated with them are silenced. For example, CGI methylation is found in the inactive X chromosome. In cancer, CGIs are often hypermethylated. If the CGI is associated with a tumor suppressor gene, its hypermethylation can cause gene silencing, leading to tumorigenesis. Some examples of cancers that are caused through this mechanism are retinoblastoma (caused by the RB gene) and colorectal cancer caused by the MLH1 gene. In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is normally methylated. In both of these cases, methylation has the effect of maintaining genomic stability. Methylation at intergenic regions silences cryptic splice sites and promoters, making sure that adjacent genes are not accidentally activated or truncated during transcription. Methylation of repetitive elements prevents transposition of the elements, illegitimate recombination of elements on different chromosomes and accidental transcription of adjacent genes due to the strong promoters of IAPs. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability. This genomic instability can cause tumor suppresson genes to become inactivated and oncogenes to become activated.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster has downstream enchancers that, through chromatin looping, will preferentially bind to and enhance the transcription of Igf2. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region of the cluster is unmethylated. This allows the insulator protein CTCF to block the enchancers' access to Igf2. Instead, they enhance H19, a lncRNA located in between the ICR and the enhancers. On the imprinted paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. This both prevents CTCF binding and spreads methylation downstream to H19, silencing it. The enchancers are able to activate Igf2.</p>
<p>The Wilm's tumor is caused by an overexpression of Igf2. Overexpression of Igf2 can result from several epigenetic abnormalities. Simple hypermethlation of the H19/Igf2 ICR on the maternal allele causes its Igf2 to be expressed, along with the Igf2 from the paternal allele. A more complex abnormality that causes Igf2 overexpression is paternal uniparental disomy. This occurs when a person inherits two copies of the paternal chromosome that carries the H19/Igf2 cluster and no copies of the maternal allele. An abnormal imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster combined with abnormalities in the Kcnq1 cluster leads to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome due to the loss of Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressing gene and overexpression of Igf2, an oncogene.</p></div>
