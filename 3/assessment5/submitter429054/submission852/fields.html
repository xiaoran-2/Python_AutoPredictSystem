        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<p><em><span><span>Expression of lgf2 normally happens only  in paternal allele where its imprinting control region ICR is methylated. In this case a protein called CTCF can't bind to this region. CTCF is an insulator, it blocks enhancers from activating lgf2 gene.</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span>If CTCF protein is not attached to ICR, then enhancers are free to act on lgf2 gene, and it is expressed. Lgf2 gene produces a major fetal growth promoting hormone.<br /><br />On maternal chromosome, ICR region is not methylated and therefore protein CTCF binds to the ICR, blocking lfg2 gene from enhancers, redirecting them from expressing lgf2 gene to instead activating a transcription of non coding RNA from H19 gene as a secondary choice. Therefore, lgf2 gene is not expressed in the maternal chromosome, it is maternally imprinted.  <br /><br />In normal cells, lfg2 is synthesized only from a paternal allele.<br /><br />In cancer, ICR in a maternal allele is methylated just like in a paternal allele. Lgf2 genes is activated in both alleles, and twice as many of lgf2 protein are synthesized</span></span></span></span></em><em><span><span>.

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

<p><em><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><strong>Decitabine</strong> belongs to class of DNA methyltransferase1 inhibitors. DNMT1 is enzyme which copies the epigenetic mark from mother strand of DNA to daughter’s during DA replication. It is responsible for DNA methylation. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span>Decitabine gets incorporated into DNA just before the replication stage and irreversibly binds DNMT1 enzyme disallowing its further release. <br />Action of the Decitabine therefore is coincided with cell division. It inhibits the methylation of daughter’s strand of DNA, permanently losing the repressive epigenetic mark.</span></span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span>Decitabine inhibits DNMT1 in normal dividing cells just as in cancer, but because cancer cells divide uncontrollably, they might accumulate the inhibitor faster and a bigger doses.<br /><br /> Not much known how this mechanism works, but DNA demethylation is documented in cancer cells of treated patients, and there are impressive resuts: total remission in 50% of patients or some improvement in 25%. Decitabine is useful to treat </span></span></span></span></em><em><span style="color:#4a4a4a;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span>Myelodysplastic Syndromes and </span></span></span></span></em><em><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span>Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.</span></span></span></span></em></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.

    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
