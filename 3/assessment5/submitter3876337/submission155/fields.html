    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although generally CpG islands are protected from methylation, normally when methylation occurs at GpG islands it silences gene expression.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation at CpG repeats has been linked to tumor formation. In cancer the methylation can be disrupted, and in some cases this can result in the methylation of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, leading to the silence of their expression and potentially allowing the growth of tumors due to the lack of that regulation. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, GpG islands are normally unmethylated. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements however, are normally methylated.</p>
<p>In repetative regions hypomethylation commonly occurs at repeats and can occur at intergenic regions. This can lead to genomic instabitity, eg activation of repeats, illegitimate recombination due to the chromation to be open because of the hypomethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor belonging to the class of inhibitor known as DNA-demethylating agents. This means it has the effect of inhibiting DNA methylation.</p>
<p> It is currently in use as a drug already being sold to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs such as this one often work by effecting the action of enzymes involved in methylation. In this case this means that due to interruption in the action of the enzymes involved in methylation, methylation does not occur.</p>
<p>This in turn inhibits the development of a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can result in changes which are actually possibile to be mitotically heritable. This means it is possible for it to have a longer lasting effect on the epigenome, including after the drug has ceased to be administered.</p>
<p>However, there are other points during which this modification may be altered, periods sensitive to the modification of methylation.. This includes gametogenesis (creation of the sex cells), early development post fertilisation and in the lab when somatic cells are treated in a way which induces them to become plutipotent again (able to be able to diffeentiate into may different cell types)</p>
<p>Treating patients therefore may have consequences which are long term. However this is considered less of a problem when treating older/elderly patients rather that for example child patients. For example we could see unwanted effects on the developing germ cells in younger patients because of potential epigenetic modifications occuring during the formation of the germ cells or during early development post fertilisation in these patients if they choose to start a family.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele it is normally methylated, meaning it is active and lg2f is therefore expressed.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is normally unmethylated and deactivated and therefore lgf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor there is not imprinting in all of the tumor cells, which can lead to lgf2 being expressed form both the maternal and paternal alleles.</p></div>
