    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in two primary ways in cancer.  First, there tends to be hypermethylation at the CpG islands.  Second, there tends to be hypomethylation of other areas in the genome.</p>
<p>The hypermethlyation of the CpG islands results in the blockage of the tumor suppressing action of these islands.  Hypermethylation can also be seen on the CpG island shores. Because of the loss of tumor suppression, tumors are more likely to grow unrestricted why this kind of hypermethylation occurs. Examples of hypermethylation of CpG islands occur in RB resulting in renoblastoma, MLH1 resulting in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 resulting in breast cancer, and MGMT resulting in both gliomas and colorectal tumors. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the intergenic and repetitive elements of the genes can result in deletions, translocations and insertions which can result in tumorgenesis.  The hypermethylation varies depending on tumor type.  Because of this differentiation of hypermethylation in tumors, the methylation can be used as epigenetic marks for both tumor identification and the prognosis of the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When a cell looses its imprinting, both the maternal and paternal allele can be either expressed or silenced.  In the case of IGF2,  typically the paternal IGF2 is expressed and the maternal IGF2 is not expressed.  In some cases, H19 becomes methylated in the maternal genes, so the maternal IGF2 which is usually silenced, is expressed by both the maternal and paternal genes.  This results an overabundance of the IGF2 and is characterized by Wilm's tumor. It is still not known why the disruption of imprinting occurs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                               </p>
<p>Decitabine is one of many drugs that target the epigenetic process, but one of four that has been approved by the FDA.  Decitabine is an azacitidine.  It functions to promote DNA demethylation by becoming directly incorporating into the DNA so that when the DNA methyltransferase binds it copies the methylation to the daughter strand. It is cell-devision dependent which is why it works on cancer cells but has less of an impact on normal, slower dividing cells.  It is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes that are precursors to acute myelogenous leukemia. Initially, these DNMTi drugs were used in large doses and proved to be very toxic, but recently it has been found that in small doses they work well for myelodysplastic syndrome patients without the deleterious side effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation are incorporated into daughter strands by DNA methltranserase, thereby permanently binding it.  This will result in a the drugs having a lasting impact on the epigenetics of the cells.  By using epigenetic modification drugs, it is possible that more conventional chemotherapy drugs can become more effective because the cancer cells would be weakened by the change in their methylation.  There are sensitive periods, namely during very early development fetus, and when the individual is developing germ cells, when epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Using epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods in development, could result in transgenerational epigenetic effects that are unknown.  Because of this, much more research would be needed before using epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods.</p></div>
