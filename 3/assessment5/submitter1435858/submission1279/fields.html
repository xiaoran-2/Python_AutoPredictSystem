    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a epigenetic process that changes the chemical properties of a DNA sequence (cytosine-guanine connections, or CpG islands), which leads to silencing of a gene in the sequence. In cancer cells, DNA methylation shows distinct patterns compared to normal cells: across all the genome, cancer cells are less methylated than normal cells; but in some specific loci, cancer cells are more methylated, leading to silencing of specific genes. The overall hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, and the specific hypermethylation is often associated with silencing of genes which function prevent tumorigenesis (tumor-supressor genes).</p>
<p>Some regions of the genome are normally highly methylated - intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Although these regions don't have specific genes, removal of their methylation marks leads to deleterious effects in genomic stability - some genetic material that actually code for proteins in neighboring regions can switch places (translocated), be inserted, or deleted, and in turn lose their normal function. This process happens in cancer, due to the genome-wide hypomethylation that is observed in basically all types of tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is a growth-promoting gene. Its overdosage leads to a tumor in children's kidneys called Wilm's tumor. This condition is prevented by an imprinting mechanism: the paternal allele is methylated in the imprint control region (ICR) for this gene, and Igf2 expression occurs; the maternal allele isn't methylated, allowing the CTCF complex to bind the ICR and prevent the expression of Igf2 in favor of the expression of the H19 gene. When this imprinted mechanism is disrupted, both the maternal and paternal alleles express the Igf2 gene, causing the tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor used to treat haematological malignacies. It acts by inhibiting the methylation of tumor-supressor genes, that are silenced in affected blood cells. The cells are demethylated during the duplication of the DNA, because the drug binds to the enzyme responsible for stablishing methylation after cell replication. But this drug have non-specific action, therefore all cells in the body undergoing replication can be affected by its action. Because cancer cells replicate much faster, its action is more strong in these cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are stable throughout consecutive replications of a cell lineage - therefore, drug-induced alterations that facilitate cancer therapy can persist in the life of a pacient and impair development in the future. If such a drug is used during a sensitive period - that is, periods where the epigenetic machinery is being stablished, as in during methylation after epigenetic reprograming in conception, or during high activity of stem cells, alterations in the epigenome can persist in the life of the individual, bringing unpredictable and deleterious consequences for development.</p></div>
