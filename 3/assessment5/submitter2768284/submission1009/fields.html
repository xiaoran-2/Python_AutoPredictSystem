    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides often found in promoters at the start of genes and are involved in the regulation of gene transcription.  Generally, unmethylated state of the CpG islands in promoters is associated with active expression of the related genes.</p>
<p>In locus-specific DNA methylation, a methyl group is added to the 5’-group of cytosines in the CpG dinucleotides in these CpG islands resulting in the promoters being less able to bind with transcription factors.  Depending on the level of hypermethylation of the CpG islands, this leads to reduced or silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, tumour suppressor genes can be silenced due to genetic mutation or through epigenetic means by hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoters, resulting in loss of control of cell proliferation. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable in cells, accumulates in tissue overtime, and may lead to cancer.  Silencing of tumour suppressor genes through hypermethylation generally occurs more frequently than genetic mutations.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions, and repetitive elements make up most of the non-protein-coding part of the genome, where the CpG dinucleotides are typically methylated in normal cells and helps to maintain genomic stability through a number of ways.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, methylation facilitates chromatin packing, keeps cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites silent, and prevents deletion, reciprocal translocations and insertions in chromosomes.  In repetitive elements, methylation prevents transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination by silencing the repeats.  Mutation of repeats (methylated-C converted to T) further prevents transposition.</p>
<p>A hallmark with cancer is the observation of genome-wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylations undermine genomic stability as maintained by methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Serious aberrations can lead to tumorigenesis. It has been observed that genome-wide hypomethylation occurs early in tumorigenesis, and progresses with time.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated, and is unable to bind to insulator protein CTCF.  Without CTCF, DNA methylation at the ICR spreads downstream to the promoter of H19 gene, silencing its expression. Also, without blocking by CTCF, downstream enhancers are free to act in chromatin looping to the Igf2 gene upstream to ICR, thus enhancing its expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, and able to bind to CTCF, which blocks downstream enhancers from looping to the upstream Igf2 gene, thus downregulating Igf2.  Being blocked, the enhancers act on secondary looping to H19 gene located in closer proximity upstream, thus enhancing its expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can be disrupted due to genetic mutations or loss in epigenetic imprinting.  The latter could involve methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, or the accidental inheritance of two copies of the particular paternal chromosome on which the H19/Igf2 cluster resides and none maternally. Effectively there are now two paternal working copies of H19/Igf2 cluster, resulting in silencing of H19 gene which restricts cell growth and upregulating Igf2 gene, which promotes cell growth.  This can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs).</p>
<p>In cancers, aberrant DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes results in the silencing of these genes, and shutting down their function to restrict cell growth.</p>
<p>When applied to cells, Decitabine acts by incorporating into DNA during replication without changes to DNA sequence, and inhibiting methylation by DNA methyltranferase.</p>
<p>It has been found that given in low doses to cancer patients, Decitabine effectively reverses methylation of tumour suppressor genes by inhibiting methylation during replication, restores their expression originally shut down by methylation in the oncogenic process, and makes the disease more benign and more responsive to chemotherapy.  Also, in low doses, Decitabine has been found not to cause DNA damage to other cellular processes.  With tumour suppressor genes restored to unmethylated state, aberrant methylation will no longer be mitotically be passed on to daughter cells during cell replication.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a common type of epigenetic marks which are mitotically inheritable in somatic cells.  Once laid down, DNA methylation is maintained for the life of the organism.  Epigenetic drugs act to restore aberrant DNA methylations that led to diseases in the first place to normal pattern.  Such restored pattern of DNA methylations would be expected to be maintained in subsequent cell divisions, and thus can have enduring effects on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>Epigenetically speaking, there are two periods early in human development that involves reprogramming of epigenetic marks whereby the epigenetic marks are erased and new epigenetic marks are laid. These periods are known as sensitive periods of epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>The two sensitive periods are during the primordial germ cell development, when resetting of parent-of-origin genomic imprints occurs, and the early embryonic development, when differential epigenetic marks are laid for development of inner cell mass and trophectoderm.</p>
<p>During these periods, the re-establishment with new epigenetic marks is most sensitive to disruptions.  Treatment with epigenetic drugs during these periods could induce loci-specific or genome-wide changes to normal DNA methylation, with lasting damaging consequences. Thus treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.</p></div>
