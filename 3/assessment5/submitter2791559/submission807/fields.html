    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions that contain large amounts of CpG sites. CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters and are usually free of methylation independent of their activity state. In general, when CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated genes are expressed. If methylation occurs genes are therefore silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. This gene may be a tumor suppressor gene (controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair) which when is silenced contributes to cancer.</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells the CpG sites are methylated (heterochromatin); this helps to maintain genomic stability avoiding recombination between repeats, transpositions and activation of cryptic promoters. In cancer, these regions tend to be hypomethylated then this generates genomic instability . This phenomenon may be of importance when the gene involved is an oncogene, or when a translocations give rise to an overexpression of regulatory genes (for example in follicular lymphoma t (14,18) leads to bcl-2 overexpression). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This speculation comes from his findings in patients with lung cancer. First, he found that patients treated with both, HDACi and DNMTi, had some response to treatment and 2nd, those who did not response at all when were further exposed to conventional chemotherapy did well or better than expected. This last finding may be explained because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter until death.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are those periods of time where cells are susceptible of modifications in their genome or epigenome. In class it was defined as the period when altered enviroments have an effect on epigenetic control. Predominantly during the establishment of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>These periods are:</p>
<p>From germinal cell development until production of eggs and spem (gametes)</p>
<p>Preimplentation and early post implantation period</p>
<p>In the somatic maintanance period (after birth) there are brief periods of time when particular organs in developement or maturation will be sensitive. But changes at this point will only affect the specific tissue and not the whole body.</p>
<p>When treating pregnant women or children, both fetus and children may suffer from genetic or epigenetic modifications in their developing organs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of imprinted control regions (ICR) does not necessarily correlates with silencing.  It correlates with imprinting of the paternal or maternal allele.</p>
<p>In the case of H19/Igf2 cluster it is paternally imprinted. </p>
<p>When the ICR is unmethylated it binds to a protein called CTCF which is an insulator protein. Then insulates Igf2 on the maternal allele from down stream enhancers.  These enhancers then activate a long non coding RNA expression called H19 in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the other hand the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. Then, CTCF cannot bind to ICR and enhancers act directly on Igf2 in the paternal allele. The H19 in the paternal allele is silenced because of the spreading of methylation</p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, the most common abnormalities are the H19/Igf2  and Kcnq1 disruption at 11q15.5.</p>
<p>Two paternal like alleles are present and  in the abscense of H19  from the maternal allele, both Igf2  will be directly expressed.</p>
<p>H19 acts like a tumor suppressor and Igf2 works as an oncogene. Wilm's tumor is the most common type of cancer in children with B-W syndrome. But is not the only cancer linked with this disorder.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitabine and Vidaza are DNA-demethylating agents. They belong to the nucleoside analogues chemical group. In this way these molecules are incorporated in the DNA and RNA synthesis. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis. The incorporation into RNA leads to inhibition of the production of protein.</p>
<p>Because of leukemic cells have a higher rate of cell division than normal cells, these drugs are more toxic in cancer cells.</p></div>
