    <h1>Submission 736 from Anon (session_user_id: b17ae1fba9572d5a46c68a04f20e9bd65944e290)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Epigenetic drugs like Decitabine is a DNA-<strong>demethylating</strong> agent that function as inhibitor of DNA methytransferase. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancers results in increased  cell growth.Decitabine is a analog of 2'-deoxycytodine nucleoside that gets incorporated in DNA during replication  and is not methylated by DNMT1 in daughter cells. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable resulting in hypomethylation by dilution and  restores gene functions that are dysregulated in cancer cells mainly cellular differentiation and proliferation.  Cytotoxic effects of Decitabine is also due to  formation of  covalent adducts between DNA incorporated Decitabine and DNA methytransferase. It also results in the inhibition of DNA sysnthesis.   Anti-tumor effects of Decitabine - hypomethylation and inhibition of DNA sythesis are concentration dependent. Lower concentration of drug results in hypomethylation without much effect on DNA synthesis, however, higher concentration can cause inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as non-specific toxicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs like DNA-demethyalting agents have alter the methylation pattern by decreasing methylation at CpG islands. This can change the higher order chromatin structure altering gene expression in tumor cells. Altered epigenetic changes  are heritable mitotically  thereby changing the overall cell growth pattern. Moreover, changes in nuclear chromatin organizations can make cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapeutic drugs.  </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs change the methylation pattern and histone modification which once established are maintained by cells, therefore, should be avoided during sensitive periods of primodial germ cell development and early development, since these are the active periods of epigenetic reprogramming.  Early development  involves demethylation of paternal and maternal genome and  laying down of epigenetic marks for tissue specific lineages.  Treatment with epigenetic drugs has a potential for either silencing  or activating the gene due to methylation and histone modification which may disrupt the specificity of gene expression in different tissue lineages causing diseases or disorders . Similarly during primodial germ cell development somatic epigenetic marks are removed for laying epigenetic marks for  germ cells . Epigenetic drugs  at this sensitive period potentially can change epigenetic marks that unlike imprinting are never removed  and may be transmitted transgenerationally via gametes resulting in multigenerational effects. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells,cytosine in DNA is methylated in introns, intergenomic and repetitive elements. However, CpG islands are generally hypo-methylated although they may be dynamically methylated during reprogramming or differentiation in certain cell type which shows epigenetic differences among tissues. When methylated they are connected with silencing of the gene. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. In cancer cells, there is a global shift of DNA methylation with hypermethylation at CpG islands upstream to promoters causeing silencing of genes downstream and is the hall mark of most cancers. CpG methylated regions are bound by mecp1 and mecp2 proteins resulting in condensation of chromatin, chromatin reorganization  and epigenetic reprogramming of cancer cells and thereby preventing the expression of genes most often related to cell growth regulators. Progression of cancer is related to further hypermethylation. Specificity of CpG hypermethylation with respect to promotors is seen  with tumor types.  <em>I</em>t  gives hetergenity  to cancer and makes it difficut to treat. </p>
<p>Normally DNA methylation of intergenomic and repetitive elements  prevents the alternative transcription start sites, antisense transcription and direct RNA splicing. It prevents mutagenic events because losing amine group converts cytosine to thymine. Therefore, is responsible for genomic integrity and stability. In cancer cells hypomethylation of intergenomic allows mismatched recombination, faulty transcriptions  and chromatin looping causing genomic instability which is the present in every cancer type.</p>
<p> Repetitive elements tend to make copies of themselves and transpose to other parts of genome that can cause disruption of genes and is mutagenic. Methylation of repetitive elements prevents it to make copies and transpose in the genome, prevents illegimate recombination hence maintaining genomic integrity. Hypomethylation of repeititive elements in cancer cells can result in copies of repetitive elements in genome causing gene disruption, mismatched recombination, increased cell growth and reduced apoptosis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigentic process during development that results in monoallelic gene expression. One example is the maternally imprinted Igf2, located at chromosome 11, by the mechansim of enhaner blocking. Imprinted control region(ICR) of h19/Igf2 cluster  is methylated in paternal chromosome resulting in inhibition of h19 expression.  Insulator protein CTCF can't bind to methylated ICR allowing the enhancers downstream to h19 to promote the expression of Igf2 on paternal allele. However,  ICR on maternal allele is not methylated resulting in its being bound by insulator protein CTCF therefor the enhancer elements on maternal chromosome does not act on Igf2 rather enhances the expression of h19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor,  maternal chromosome h19/Igf2 locus reverses to paternal epigenotype with methylation of h19 promotor, Igf2 is turned on and h19 is turned off  resulting in enhanced cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 or Igf2 can cause bialleleic expression of H19 or Igf2. Alteration in methylation also changes histone modifications resulting in changed higher order chromatin  structure causing  two opposite effects because H19 supresses while Igf2 enhaces cell growth.   Loss of imprinting of Igf2 is seen in many cancers like colon, ovarian because of increased cell growth.</p></div>
