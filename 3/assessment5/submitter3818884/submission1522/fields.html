<p class="western"> </p>
<p class="western">CpG islands are regions near promotors that are normally not methylated so the genes can be transcribed. In cancer cells,  this islands are methylated, so normal functions of that genes can no longer be done, in fact, in some cancers these genes are tumor supressor genes, so  the missregulation of their function can help cancer progression.</p>
<p class="western">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, so the repetitive elements are not transcribed and end being copied a lot of times in the genome. However, in cancer cells this elements are not methylated, and this contributes to genome inestability and ends into translocations, insertions, deletions and this lead to desrregulation of the cellular cycle.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                               </p>
<p class="western">The cluster H19/Igf2 is methylated in the paternal allele and this leads to the expression of the Igf2 gene and a repression of the H19 gene. In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated an this leads to the repression of Igf2 and expression of H19. In Wilm's tumor, both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated, and this lead to an overexpression of Igf2 and a missexpression of H19. As Igf2 is a growth factor, it's overexpression can promote the disease by desrregulating the cellular cycle. (sorry about my english)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                               </p>
<p class="western">Decitabine inhibits the DNA methyltransferase, so it should help to stop the abnormal methylation of DNA at CpG islands in cancer cells, this way, tumor supressor genes can be transcribed and do its function and the tumor won't progress. (sorry about my english)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                               </p>
<p class="western">DNA methylation is inheritable by mitosis so daugther cells of those that receive the treatment also have the same methylation condition and, in this way, the effect of this epigenetic drugs can be more estable in time. However, there are sensitive periods, that are periods when the cells are cleaned from epigenetics marks and those are reestablished later, changes of enviroment during this sensitive periods can lead to changes in methylation and imprinted regions and this often leads to disease. This periods are during early development and gametogenesis, so pregnant woman and kids  should be advised of the risk of this kind of drugs and the consecuences in their fetus or fertility.
