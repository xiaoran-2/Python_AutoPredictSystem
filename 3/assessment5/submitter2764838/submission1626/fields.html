    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer results from silencing of tumor suppressor or hypomethylation of oncogenes. In a normal cell, CpG islands are typically hypomethylated and act as single biomarker that distinguishes cancer cells from normal cells. But in cancer cells, CpG islands tend to hypermethylate thus silencing the tumor suppressor genes. The CpG islands are usually found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes; in cancer cells they are hypermethylated to silence those genes, for example, BRCA1 gene in breast cancer and RB gene in retinoblastoma.</p>
<p>According to Knudson hypothesis, cancer results due to multiple hits to DNA and DNA methylation can be one of those hits. These CpG hypermethylation varies with tumor types and increases with the progress of the cancer. The neighboring 2 kb regions of CpG islands called CpG island shores are also found to be hypermethylated which contributes to the silencing of the gene.</p>
<p>The cancer cells also show genome-wide hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions and its consequences are dependent on its location. It occurs early in tumorogenesis and increases with time. In a normal cell, hypermethylation of these regions helps to stabilize the genome by making them more compact to prevent the recombination between them. But in cancer cells, since they are hypomethylated and less densely packed, illegitimate recombination occurs between them. It also results in activation of repeats where they make a copy of themselves and transpose to some other location in genome resulting in activation of very strong cryptic promoters or disruption to neighboring genes. It results in deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocation of repeats.</p>
<p>For example, deletion of dnmt1 in mouse leads to genomic instability and cancer. In humans, mutations in DNMT3B (responsible for denovo methylation) results in ICF syndrome where hypomethylation of pericentromeric repeats results in genomic instability.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting occurs in cancer by hyper or hypo-methylation of Imprint control regions (ICRs) to overactivate growth promoting genes or silencing growth suppressing genes. For example, ICR of Igf2/H19 cluster in normal cells is methylated on paternal allele making it difficult for CTCF to bind to it, enhancers bind to Igf2 leading to its expression. ICRs are unmethylated on maternal allele where CTCF bind to it and enhancers can only bind to H 19, thus silencing the Igf2 on maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, loss of imprinting occurs by hypermethylation of ICRs of both maternal and paternal alleles resulting in the expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Igf2 is a growth promoter and twice the dose of this factor results in kidney tumor; this occurs in preneoplastic tissues and therefore is an early event. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Different drugs used for cancer target the enzymatic epigenetic regulators since they are easily targeted and their active sites easily found by small molecules. Decitabine belongs to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi) which are nucleoside analogues and replication dependent. It is approved for Myelodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer. During replication, this gets incorporated into DNA, where DNMT1 binds irreversibly to the DNA and thus suppress the growth of cancer cells which are most actively dividing.  Decitabine acts as a demethylating agent. At high doses, this is toxic and nonspecific and results in severe side-effects. However, at much lower doses, it causes DNA demethylation and have anti-neoplastic effect to kill tumor cells. This is very effective in myelodysplastic malignancies which might relate to CpG hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Synergism of DNMTi and HDACi at much lower doses is used clinically along with standard chemotherapeutics.  This targets multiple components of epigenetic machinery which results in better and effective outcome. The drugs that target DNA methylation can have an effect beyond the treatment since DNA methylations are mitotically heritable. </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are from primordial germ cells to formation of germ cells, and preimplantation and early post implantation periods. Both these periods are times of active remodeling of genome when active removal and re-establishment of epigenetic marks occurs. But at some locus in the genome, this clearing is incomplete; this is referred to as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. These are most sensitive to environmental changes. During somatic maintenance, tissue specific differentiation in different organs occurs, which is also a sensitive but less than above two.  </p>
<p>In epialleles DNA methylation levels of intracisternal A particle (IAP) retrotransposons control the expression of the neighboring gene. These are resistant to the removal of DNA methylation during reprogramming events in the gametes and early embryos. Drugs should be used with caution with younger patients who are developing germ cells and are in sensitive periods because they may disrupt their epigenetic control. </p></div>
