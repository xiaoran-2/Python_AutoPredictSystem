    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the process in which there is an addition of a methyl group to the adenine or cytosine nucleotides. Then DNA methylation changes the expression of genes in cells as cells differentiate from stem cells to specific tissues. But when there is cancer, CpG islands get abnormal hypermethylatin, which allows the daughter cells to inherit transcriptional silencing during cell division. Hypermethylation happens in the promoter region, which is involved with gene inactivation. DNA methylation happens in the intergenic regions so that the RNA polymerase doesn't head to the opposite direction, and DNA methylation happens in repetitive elements to silence repeats so that they can prevent transposition from strong promoters. But when people have cancer, DNA methylation is disrupted and the promoter regions are transcriptionally silent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted alleles are silenced so that genes are expressed from the non'imprinted allele from the mother or father (only one of them). Genomic imprinting is based on monoallelic gene expression so thus, if the paternal allele is expressed, the maternal allele is silenced; this imprint is based on DNA methylation at the imprint control regions. Methylation pattern of the paternal allele is rapid and active, while the methylation pattern of the maternal allele is passive. The maternal and paternal genomes/alleles are treated differently. Imprinting at the Igf2 or H19 cluster is disrupted in the Wilm´s tumor because the maternal Igf2 imprint is relaxed so that the gene that should be expressed is expressed biallelically. This shows that a paternal epigenotype has been gained in the tumors due to the pathologic disruption in the normal imprinting of these genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is sold in a Japanese company as Dacogen, which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which lead to myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine belongs to a group called demethyation agent, and it's an anti-cancer drug. Methylation is a process that heightens the activity of suppressor genes that regulate cell growth and division; thus, suppressor genes are then hindered from carrying out their role, promoting cancer. At the presence of Decitabine, demethylation can happen, and the tumor suppressor genes can carry out their normal role and have total control over cell growth and division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Stephen Baylin and other researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, they figured out that together, azacitidine and histone-deacetylase inhibitor slowed tumor growth in some people, leading Dr. Stephen Baylin to speculate such statement. Sensitive periods are times when children are willing and sticking to a certain activity in order for a specific development to happen in them. Sensitive periods of developments are times when there are important periods of childhood development, times specifically for receiving a particular trait, or periods of transitory duration. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be advisable because if you interrupt the senstive period, the child may not be able to acquire the trait or ability to do something that may hinder the child from normal development and growth. This would lead to even more dire effects like degrading the sensibility to have proper development in the later stages, or even slow growth processes such as those related to cognitive learning.</p></div>
