    <h1>Submission 1390 from Anon (session_user_id: 9d729f25124354e6c11101071b81e58922967ff4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine may be used to treat myelodyplastic syndrome by demethylating the affected DNA, which classifies it as a DNMT inhibitor. According to the lecture, decitibine is indicated for myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) that has progressed to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). According to other sources I've checked online and the Economist article, it seems that it can also be used to treat MDS before it progresses to AML. Once DNA demethylation takes place the silenced tumour suppressor genes are reactivated and programmed cell death can begin again. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects as epigenetic state is mitotically heritable and needs to be maintained through cell division.  There is also evidence for potential transgenerational inheritance through the gametes.  A sensitive period is a time when somatic cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming, specifically during the establishment of epigenetic marks rather than the maintenance.</p>
<p>Early embryonic and germ cell development are considered the most sensitive periods as they affect the whole organism, however there are other periods of sensitivity in development as different organs and tissues can go through periods of development up until roughly the age of 25. This is something that needs to be considered by doctors in younger patients, as there is no way of targeting specific tissues so treating patients with epigenetic drugs can affect all tissues. This is also something that needs to be considered when treating women who are of child-bearing age. In particular, planned pregnancies of patients who have taken epigenetic drugs should be discussed with a doctor to determine an appropriate amount of time has passed to ensure safety of the fetus. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression of one of the X chromosomes as a means of dosage compensation. Aside from that, CpG islands are generally protected against methylation. In cancer, CpG islands can become hypermethylated, silencing tumour suppressor genes when located at the promoter. Once these genes are silenced, cells continue to divide without regulated cell death happening. Hypermethylation can also cause DNA repair mechanisms to be silenced leading to mutations in the genome that can cause cancer. DNA hypermethylation is locus specific.</p>
<p>DNA methylation, at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, is thought to contribute to genomic stability. It silences and also mutates (changing Cytosine to Thymine) repeats to prevent transposition. DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions/repeats leads to genomic instability and an increase in transposition which causes mutations in the genome. Mutations and deletions can also affect changes upstream or downstream of the affected gene by activating, stopping, or altering the proteins of neighouring genes. DNA hypomethylation is found genome wide and has been found in every type of cancer that has been studied. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is an growth promoting gene (oncogene) that is normally protected by an insulator protein (CTCF) that insulates it from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at this ICR prevents binding of the CTCF protein which causes the methylation to spread to the H19 promoter and silences it, allowing Ifg2 to be activated. This epigenetic mark is materally transmitted, but expressed through the paternal allele. In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which we studied in week 4, the disease is caused by maternal allele behaving like the imprinted paternal allele and a loss of imprinting through hypermethylation of the normally unmethylated maternal allele. It is passed on by a carrier mother to 50% of offspring through autosomal dominant inheritance. One of the phenotypes of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a higher incidence of embryonic and childhood tumours, such as Wilm's tumour-a kidney cancer, that are rarely found in adults. </p></div>
