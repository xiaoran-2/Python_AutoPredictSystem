    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In cancer cell various alterations in methylation patterns have been found.</div>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is the regulation of gene activity and the influence in local chromatin structure. In normal cells, CpG islands are usually kept free of methylation independently of their activity state. In cancer cells, CGIs are hypermethylated. This change in the epigenetic state of the CpG islands in cell cancer can cause silencing of underlying genes such as </span>tumor suppressor genes which are important in the malignant progression.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Moreover, epigenetic changes at the intergenic regions and repetitive elements has been detected. In normal cells, these regions are methylated which avoids their transcription and maintains genome architecture. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, thus progressing to malignancy. These alterations result in genomic instability, increment of chromosome aberrations and activation of oncogenes through the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Epigenetic alterations of imprinting controlled region can be related to malignant progression. One of the most interesting examples is the IC1: a methylation-sensitive chromatin insulator which controls the H19/Igf2 expression. In normal cells, the maternal allele is unmethylated thus enabling the transcription of H19 (a cell growth inhibitor) and the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein). CTCF insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and inhibits its transcription. Moreover, the paternal allele is methylated, thus inhibiting the binding of CTCF and the H19 expression, so the downstream enhancers promote the transcription of Igf2 which is a growth factor. </div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maternal and paternal alleles are mutually regulated in healthy individuals. In Willm’s tumor, the maternal allele has been found methylated which causes an overproduction of Igf2 that is associated to cell overgrowth and cancer.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used for myelodysplastic syndromes treatment. Methyltransferases are a group of enzymes that transfer a methyl group from a donor to an acceptor maintaining the epigenetic state of the cells. The inhibition of these enzymes results in hypomethylation of cells. Although the mechanism of action is still unclear, one of the possible explanations is related to the hypermethylation pattern of tumor suppressor genes. The drug would recover the expression of these genes, thus helping to take control of the cell cycle.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenetic state is a dynamic process which is influenced for a set of organized factors. The establishment and subsequent maintenance of the epigenetic states are two critical process for the epigenome. Since the epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, changes in a short period of time can cause long range effects. This applies especially to methylation patterns. The establishment of epigenetic marks is especially important in sensitive periods which are specific periods of time during a lot of these marks are fixed. For example, in epigenetic reprogramation during gametes formation and early development. Since these periods are particularly important for the normal functioning of the body, it could be deleterious to take medications that alter enzymes or proteins involved in this process. The use of these drugs could be restricted to younger people with a longer life expectancy or reproductive potential.</span></p></div>
