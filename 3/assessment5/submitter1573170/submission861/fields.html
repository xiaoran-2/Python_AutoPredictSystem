    <h1>Submission 861 from Anon (session_user_id: b6510582c40192ab538193e1b6083445e11817eb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase and prevents DNA from being methylated. DNA methylation, in general, is associated with silencing of genes. In the course of cancer, there is a global hypomethylation, but locus specific CpG island hypermethylation. These hypermethylation may silence nearby tumor suppressor genes, whose role is to prevent the uncontrollable growth of cells. Decitabine may have an anti-tumour effect by re-activating these tumour suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic states of a cell is mitotically heritable. The epigenome is subjected to reprogramming, the active clearing and remodelling of epigenetic marks, during the sensitive period, which takes place only during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development. Because epigenetics changes are passed on during cell divisions to daughter cells, epigenetic drugs may alter the growth and expression of tumor cells, which are rapidly dividing uncontrollably. Any cell divisions since the drug treatment will have an altered epigenome. </p>
<p>Treating patients during the sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because it will affect the patients in a more global sense, to all the cell types, cancerous or normal. These changes will be carried on in all mitotic divisions leading to development problems, where cells that should be expressed are not, or vice versa. For example, If the patient was treated with DNA methylation inhibitors, then all the cells will be inhibited from DNA methylation, leading to global silencing, including the ones important for growth and development. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found in the promoter regions of genes, and are generally hypomethylated regardless of the activity state in normal situation. In cancer, many CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to silencing of the nearby genes. Disrupting DNA methylation at CpG islands may lead to genomic instability, down regulation of gene expression, and silencing of tumor suppressor genes which function to prevent uncontrollable cell growth. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitve elements help to regulate gene expression profile and chromatin compartmentalization by repressing alternative transcription start sites, inhibiting antisense transcription, or directing RNA splicing. In cancer, there is a global hypomethylation in the genome. This leads to genomic instability where repeat elements are no longer silenced. Illegitimate recombinations, cryptic promoter activation, and transposition of the repetitive elements are more prone to happen. All these lead to further genomic instability and disruption of gene expression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR), an Igf2 insulator, in the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. In the paternal allele, the ICR insulator is methylated and this methylation is spread to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 long non-coding RNA. Without CTCF insulator, downstream enchancers can access Igf2 activating its expression. In the maternal allele, CTCF and H19 are not methylated and are expressed. When CTCF is expressed, downstream enhancers cannot access Igf2 and it is not expressed. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, CTCF imprinting control region is hypermethylation at both alleles. So the maternal allele is behaving like the paternal allele, thus disrupting the imprinting cluster of gene expression. This leads to Igf2 over expression (double dosed). Because Igf 2 expression is a growth promoting factor, this leads to unwanted cell growth. The symptoms of Wilm's tumor include enlarged organs, especially in the kidney. </p></div>
