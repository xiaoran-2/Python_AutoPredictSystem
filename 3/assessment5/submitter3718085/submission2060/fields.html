    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to transcribe in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes. It does this by keeping these regions hypomethylated to keep active tumor suppresor genes. When these regions are disrupted, for instance they become hypermethylated, tumore suppressor genes are silenced. This means they no longer are able to suppress tumor growth and can lead to cancer producing tumors. Different CpG islands genes differ in type of cancer.</p>
<p>The normal functionof DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements according to most experts is to maintian genomic integrity.  When this is disruptive, let's say both intergenic regions or repetitive elements are no longer methylated but hypomethylated, a few things can go wrong.First, deletions may occur, which is when you lose a part of a chromosome, secondly insertions, which is when you gain more of that chromose or duplicate it, and thirdly, reciprocal translocations where two different chromosome intertwine or combine with each and no longer are stable. The main reason that this things occur is because since they are no longer methylated the chromosomes are no longer densely packaged(no longer heterochromatin) and are now opened(euchromatin) making them sensitive transposition, transcriptional interference and illigitmate recombination.  This creates genomic instability and therfore can create different cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting Control Regions(ICR)</p>
<p>In the Maternal allele the goal here is to silence lgf2 and activate H19. This occurs because ICR is unmethylated, because it is not methylated CTCF an insulator element will bind to the ICR, this makes the enchancers activate H19 and lgf2 is kept silenced.</p>
<p>In the Paternal allele the goal is to activate or express lgf2 and silence H19. This occurs when ICR is methylated which in turn silences H19, here the enhancers go ahead and express lgf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele will have activation of lgf2 and silencing of H19. Since both the maternal and paternal alleles have lgf2 activation lgf2 will be overexpressed. lgf2 is growth promoting and therefore can create tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine belongs to a group of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in epigenetics.</p>
<p>Since it inhibits DNA methylation it works by hypomethylating the regions and therfore reversing methylation, and this helps recover expression of the silenced genes. Decitabine can ahve an anti tumour effect  by reducing silencing of tumour suppressors and eventualy because methylation is mitotic it can reverse and stop tumours from continuing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the perido of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotic in nature. Once it has been reverse genes can replicate reversing disease. Sensitive periods are periods where gene development and epigenetic stability are created. Sensitive periods in epigenetics are the pre-implantation face, the germ cell stage, and even during pre-adoloscent stages of development. In cancer treatment and the use of such drugs talked about by Dr. Stephen Baylin giving younger  children these types of drugs can alter their whole epigenetic make up. They can have a great impact on the development of their germ cells, causing epigenetic changes that can be passed down to their offspring, or perhaps also have detrimental impact on their own development.</p></div>
