    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is caused by cell proliferation in the form of a tumor.  Causes of tumor growth involve mechanisms causing too much growth or the malfunctioning of mechanisms to stop growth.   Often the source of the problem involves an epigenetic control, such as DNA methylation.  When DNA methylation is disrupted (either through hypermethylation or hypomethylation) this can lead to cancer.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are locations where large amounts of CpG’s are found.  The DNA here is typically protected from methylation and methylation of these genes (many of which are gene promoters) will result in the silencing of gene expression.  DNA is typically unmethylated at CpG islands, however in cancer, DNA is hypermethylated  both at CpG islands and CpG island shores which genes include tumor suppressor genes.  Thus when typically the tumor suppressor genes at these islands are active, in cancerous cells they have been methylated and thus are silent.  This leads to disease because it prevents the cell from suppressing overgrowth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA is typically methylated at intergenetic regions and repetitive elements throughout the genome.  This is because repetitive elements and intergenetic regions: do not code for important genes, easily introduce mistakes, have many growth promoters within them, and need to be silenced to maintain genomic stability and integrity.  However in cancer, DNA in intergenetic regions and repetitive elements is hypomethylated, allowing for the expression of previously silenced genes, increasing genomic instability, resulting in uncontrolled proliferation of cells, resulting in disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a scenario that takes place in the genome where either the maternal or paternal gene is expressed while the other is silenced. This is evidenced in the Igf2/H19 cluster. Methylation of the ICR, as on the paternal allele allows enhancers to act on Igf2, expressing the Igf2 (b/c CTCF not binding) and silencing H19.  However when the ICR is unmethylated as on the maternal allele, CTCF will bind, and now the enhancers will not bind Igf2, instead they will bind to and act on H19.  (Igf2 silenced)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer because now, instead of one copy of the allele expressed or silenced, there are two copies, or vice versa.  In the case of the H19/ Igf2 cluster, overexpression of Igf2 is caused by the loss of imprinting on the maternal allele at the ICR due to the hypermethylation of the Igf2/H19 cluster.  Whereas before the maternal allele was unmethylated and Igf2 was not expressed, the maternal allele now becomes methylated just like the paternal allele. Now there is double expression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting.  Overexpression of Igf2 due to the loss of imprinting leads to Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is a drug that works through demethylating DNA to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The enzyme DNMT mitotically transfers DNA methylation from parent cell to daughter cell.   DNMTi- DNA methyl transferase inhibitors bind irreversibly to DNMT’s through nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA upon replication.  DNMTi’s binding DNMT, inhibit the DNMT and prevent it from passing the methylation onto the next generation, destroying whatever epigenetic affect the methylation had. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine, a DNMTi, demethylates the DNA resulting in the activation of genes that were previously silenced.  In cancer, it is common that the silenced genes include tumour-suppressor genes that typically function in stopping uncontrolled cell growth.  If these genes are silenced as they are in cancers, there is an overgrowth resulting in a tumor.  Removal of the methylation marks through drugs such as Decitabine results in the reactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, thus killing the cancerous cell!</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that affects the expression of the gene at which it acts.  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning, epigenetic marks are passed from parent to daughter cell.  Altering DNA methylation via drugs can have a lasting effect on the epigenome because it will be passed mitotically from cell to cell.   Treating a patient with such a drug can contribute to the treatment of cancer cells by altering DNA methylation, which then will be passed on mitotically.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are erased and reprogrammed.  Sensitive periods in development include germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Treating a patient during sensitive periods is not advised because it will interfere with the epigenetic marks that are being established during this time such as laying down DNA methylation to protect the repetitive elements from expression, as well as many other processes.  Thus, even though drugs inhibiting methylation treat some cancers, the laying down of DNA methylation marks is very important for the expression of the genome and treating a patient during a sensitive period when these methylation marks are laid down is not advised as it may result in many more issues. </p></div>
