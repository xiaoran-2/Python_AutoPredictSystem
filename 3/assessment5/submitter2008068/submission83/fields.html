    <h1>Submission 83 from Anon (session_user_id: 39555edae2848afc9ad6d8feb4f029672d0ae655)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTI, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which inhibits transferation of methyl groups to the DNA, enabling its silencing.</p>
<p>This inhibitor is nucleoside analog, it get incorporated into the DNA and when DNA methyltransferases come along to bind it, the DNMTI comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.</p>
<p>This process is division dependent, and this is the reason why it affects more to tumour cells, because they are dividing all the time. At very high dose side effects are very important but a very low dose they have anti-neoplastic effects, thus they can be used to treat cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells no longer show imprint of expression, imprinted genes became either expressed or silenced from both parental alleles .</p>
<p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, in normal cells the imprint region is methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. When this imprint region is unmethylated CTCF  is bind as an insulator element and the enhancers act on H19 gene allowing the expression of this last gene. Whereas in paternal allele the imprint region is methylated and so is the promoter of the H19 gene, the CTCF can't bind the imprint region and in this case enhancers act on Igf2 gene instead of H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a permethylation of the imprint region in both parental alleles, this means that in the maternal allele Igf2 gene is also expressed. So there is a double dose of Igf2 gene expression. This gene is a growth promoter, and as many imprinted genes are invloved in growth, hyper/hypomethylation of those region is a common feature in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found in promoters. They can be methylated, that means silencing the gene, or unmethylated so activating  the gene. In normal cells these CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, thus allowing the expression of these genes but in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. Usually this methylation takes place in promoters of cancer suppressor genes. This epigenetic changes are mitotically hereditable and cells can be rapidily selected for, in fact the methylation progress in the time  and can be used for diagnosis and prognosis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements through the genome are hypermethylated in normal cells but hypomethylated in cancer cells. The hypomethylation causes chromosomal instability by opening the chromatin and permitting recombination between chromosomes. Several consequences of this recombination are translocation, deletions and insertions. Other consequences are the activation of cryctic promoters (very strong and active promoters) that are usualy silenced in normal cells and the jumping by transposition of genes al over the genome disrupting genes and causing genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation pattern is mitotically hereditable and cells with a new pattern can be selected for. When cells divide the new methylation pattern spreads in the cell offspring. These epigenetic alterations could cause more susceptibility to standard cancer treatment, as DNA metylation pattern is maintained mitotically, daughter cells would be more susceptible to chemotherapy. If a patient is treated with standard chemotherapy after an epigenetic drug treatment, the standard chemotherapy could be more effective.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a moment in which epigenetic marks need to be reprogrammed, by removing the previous marks and putting new ones.</p>
<p>We can distinguish 2 sensitive periods: the first is during preimplantation development, from fertilizaton until blastocyst phase (before embryo implants and make a placenta) and the second is during primordial germ cell development in which somatic marks are removed and lay down particular epigenetic signatures that are required.</p>
<p>If we treat patients with epigenetic drugs in a sensitive period, for example a child or a young teenager who hasn't finished germ cell development, we can disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming of these cells causing these patients very important problems, even infertility.</p></div>
