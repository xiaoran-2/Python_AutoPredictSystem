    <div class="field-value"><p>It is found that DNA methylation is context dependent when relating to cancer. It can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated. Both have its own consequences. Hypermethylation is found on CpG islands, normally found in promoter regions, of tumor suppressor genes. CpG islands tend to be unmethylated in normal cells so that it can be accessible to transcription factors. During hypermethylation of CpG islands, silencing of gene expression occurs. Recent findings show that there is hypermethylation observed around CpG islands referred as CpG island shores, spanning approximately 2 kb region around it. This leads to inaccessibility of promoter regions on which this CpG island shores occurs and thereby silencing the respective gene expression. Tumor suppressor genes are involved in controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. When silenced, cell proliferation occurs without check leading to cancer. Hypomethylation is found on repetitive sequences between genes and on sequences within genes. The repetitive sequences remain inactive when methylated. They remain inaccessible. Methylated repetitive sequences maintain genomic stability. When hypomethylated, the active repetitive sequences disrupt genomic stability – by performing insertions and deletions at sites and affecting the normal function of genes, illegitimate recombination occurring between unrelated chromosomes, and it also activates cryptic promoters, thereby disrupting functioning of neighboring genes. Intergenic methylation aids in repressing of transcriptional noise from alternative splicing sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and associated with replication timing. Methylation in a combination at specific sites can be used as bio-marker for identifying cancer. In addition, for cancer, the methylation is also found to be stage specific.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is a reversible and stable epigenetic mark. After careful studies, it can be used in diagnosis, prognosis as well as in treatment of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation pattern in imprinted  H19/Igf2 cluster (paternally imprinted)</p>
<p>Maternal Allele – CTCF binds to unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) and leads to the action of enhancers on the expression of H19 (lncRNA). In addition, Igf2 expression is hindered due to the CTCF binding which acts an insular and prevents the access of enhancer to Igf2.</p>
<p>Paternal Allele – Methylation is found at ICR that directs methylation or spreading of methylation occurs on H19 gene. This curbs the expression of H19 gene. CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR. Thus, enhancers are eligible to act on Igf2 and promote its expression.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is observed in tumors. The mono-allelic expression disappears. Either both the alleles express themselves or the expression is completely lost. It is attributed to the fact that most of the imprinted genes are involved in growth i.e., they are growth promoters or suppressors. Hyper and hypo methylation is observed in cancer. Here, we discuss about the effects of hypermethylation causing loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm’s tumor - both the paternal &amp; maternal alleles are methylated at ICR. CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR. Hence, the enhancers act upon Igf2 and promote its expression. Igf2, involved in growth, is expressed in larger quantities that results in cell proliferation at higher rates than normal. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Effective treatment of cancer is what the research are striving to do. The problem lies in the fact that the tumor types have varying characteristics and behave variably in different patients. Considering epigenetics as a source of treatment, as it can be treated chemically, some recent findings suggest a path of breakthrough. Decitabine, a nucleoside analogue, is a hypomethylating agent. It inhibits DNA methyl transferases (DNMT). It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It exploits the characteristic that cancer cells divide rapidly. It acts incorporating itself into DNA and inhibit DNMT, enzyme responsible for methylating newly synthesized DNA. When DNMT binds decitabine, DNMT does not go free and its activity is hindered. Thus, decitabine  slows or halts the progress of dividing cells. There is no distinction that decitabine acts only on cancer cells. The treatment looks promising if targeted hypomethylation activity occurs that targets only cancer cells. Side effects are addendum to the treatment but they are not as severe as seen in chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In perspective of epigenetics, cancer is not only limited to aberrations in DNA methylation but also includes histone modification landscape. Regulators of epigenetic machinary are also of concern. Mutations are linked to the regulatory epigenetic machinary. The chemotherapy effects draws out as the cancer epigenome chages. DNA methylation transferases inhibitors at lower doses are found to be effective in certain tumors. It, sort of, induces memory in the cells and reactivates expression of previously silenced genes.</p>
<p>A sensititve period is that phase of the life cycle where critical processes are carried out. The development processes changes occur at this point of time. Sensitive periods of development include - embryonic stages during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Interfering with the natural processes would produce drastic changes. The interference would alter the epigenetic states which would result in abnormalities or epigenetic disorders.</p></div>
