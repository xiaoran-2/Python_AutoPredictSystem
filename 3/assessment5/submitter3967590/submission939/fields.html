    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation pattern of DNA reflects which areas of the DNA can be active. Methylation of DNA makes it less accessable, influencing the structure of the DNA and hereby the availability for transcription. In normal cells, the genes needed for the functioning of that specific cell type should be accessable for transcription, while the DNA not needed, including genes as well as DNA between genes, should be silent. In cancer cells the methylation pattern is changed, either to a higher or a lower level of methylation, thus locking up (hypermethylation) or opening (hypomethylation) areas of the DNA, as compared to a normal cell, e.g. hindering access to needed genes, allowing transcription of genes that should be silent, or allowing access to DNA between genes. </p>
<p>The CpG islands, areas flagging the start of a gene, are not methylated in normal cells, this allows the gene to be transcribed, though gene expression is still controlled by other mechanisms as well. However, when a CpG island is methylated, the gene is no longer available for transcription. Lack of transcription of specific genes may lead to cancer, e.g. by disruption of a transcription factor or when by changing the balance between growth restricting and growth promoting genes. </p>
<p>The DNA of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to a much higher degree in normal cells than in cancer cells. The methylation silences these areas, which may otherwise cause</p>
<p>mutations or disturbance of the transcription of genes required in a normal cell. Intergenic regions, when transcribed, can cause disturbance of the transcription of normal genes. Repetitive elements, when “open” may jump around the genome, hereby potentially disrupting transcription or may allow for abnormal pairing of chromosomes leading to transpositions, deletions or repetitions.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some genes should exclusively be expressed from the allele of one parent. The setting of this status is regulated by imprinting control regions. The loss of the normal imprinting may lead to disease. </p>
<p>Igf2 is part of a group of genes regulated by one imprint control region, which is methylated when provided by the father and not methylated when provided by the mother. The methylation blocks the binding of an insulator, and therefore Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele while the insulator blocks the expression from the maternal allele. Furthermore, the insulator allows the transcription of the gene H19 from the maternal allele, while the paternal allele of H19 is silent, due to the promoter working on Igf2 and to methylation from into part of H19. </p>
<p>Imprinting may go wrong, thus making a maternal allele behave as a paternal allele or vice versa. In case of H19/Igf2, the incorrect methylation of the maternal imprint control region leads to the cluster being expressed as if it came from the father. Cells with two active Igf2 alleles produce too much growth promoter, leading to cancer, in this case Wilm´s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As cancer is associated with the epigenetic pattern gone wrong, a potential cure could include re-setting the pattern. Several chemicals which influence the methylation or acetylation mechanisms of the cell have been explored for effects on DNA in cancer cells, e.g. inhibitors of enzymes that remove acetyl-from histone tails or inhibitors of enzymes that add methyl to certain positions on histone tails. </p>
<p>Decitabin, approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, is an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferase. DNA-methyltransferase adds methyl to the histone tails. Therefore, inhibition of this enzyme should lead to less methyl groups on the histone tails, and in cancers, coursed by closing down of certain genes by methylation, decitabin should facilitate the repression of the cancer status of the cell. On the other hand, when cancer is coursed by demethylation of areas of the DNA that should be methylated, decitabin would most probably not work.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenic status of a cell is maintained during mitosis, as is the genetic code. However, errors during maintenance may lead to cancer. While changes to the genetic code are considered irreversible, changes in the epigenetic status may be repaired, and the re-set epigenetic status kept during future mitosis. But, cancer may be coursed by an accumulation of errors (in the genetic code and/or the epigenetic status), and therefore the re-setting of one or even several epigenetic mistakes may not bring the cell back to normal. The re-setting may, however, make the cell more responsive to other cancer treatments. </p>
<p>A drug will not only target cancer cells, but may also influence normal cells. However, the epigenetic state of normal cells is not easily impaired by epigenetic drugs, as long as the cells are in an epigenetic stable period. Sensitive periods, periods of re-programming of the epigenetic status of a cell, are restricted to: early embryonic development, formation of germ cells, maturation of germ cells. Treatments during sensitive periods are challenging as they may have a much greater impact on normal cells than seen in non-sensitive periods.</p></div>
