    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands occurs frequently at promoters, silencing the genes expression.</p>
<p>Generally in cancer cells the normal cell CpG island methylation is reversed.  Regions that were in normal cells hypermethylated become hypomethylated, causing expression.  While regions that were expressing as they were hypomethylated become silent by being hypermethylated.</p>
<p>CpG islands that become hypermethylated in cancer cells will suppress the expression of their related genes, if these genes are tumour suppressor genes, this can lead to cancer.  Conversely if the CpG islands become hypomethylated, this can allow gene expression, if these genes are oncogenes, this can lead to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements stabilizes the genome by blocking the promoters of transposable elements.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements occurring during cancer leads to increased genomic instability.  Including illegitimate recombination between repeats leading to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations.  In addition activation of repeats can lead to transposition.  Furthermore, cryptic promoters can be activated which can lead to disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, which can lead to enhanced tumourgenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>On the paternal allele H19 is methylated allowing downstream enhancers to interaction with Igf2 causing expression of Igf2</p>
<p>In the maternal allele H19 is not methylated leading to its expression, the product is an lncRNA.  When H19 is unmethylated, it is bound by protein CTCF which stops downstream enhancers, blocking expression of Igt2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the maternal H19 is hypomethylated leading to expression of Igf2 from both maternal and paternal alleles.</p>
<p>Expression of both alleles of Igf2 is growth promoting leading to mass proliferation of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, this drug is a DNA-demethylating agent.  Decitabine would inhibit the loss of methylation, potentially inhibiting the expression of genes.  Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect by stopping the expression of oncogenes, or inhibiting the expression of growth factor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter the epigenetic state of cancer cells could provide longer lasting benefits than just treatment with chemotherapy drugs as the changes that occur due to the application of epigenetic drugs are mitotically inheritable.  While they may not completely reverse the mutations causing cancer they may make the cells more susceptible to chemotherapy drugs.  Epigenetic drugs may not be suitable for childhood/teen cancers as these are sensitive periods when the next generation of germ cells is in the final stages of being developed, epigenetic changes to the germ cells could cause significant if not lethal changes to the epigenome of the next generation.  Sensitive periods occur during embryo development and gestation, and finally during puberty.  During these sensitive periods it would be advisable to not use epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
