    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential for normal development, and it plays a very important role in a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, and suppression of repetitiveelement transcription and transposition and, when dysregulated, contributes to diseases like cancer.</p>
<p> In the <strong>normal cell</strong> there are hypomethylated CpG island but repetitive element and intergenic region of general genome are methylated. <strong>In cancer</strong> <strong>cell</strong>, observed in the opposite, methylated CpG island and hypomethylated repetitive element and intergenic region, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. These changes suggest that much more of the cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation contributes to tumor formation and progression.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the methylation at the promoter can predict whether or not a gene will be expressed or not. So if, if a promoter is hypermethylated, its unlikely to be expressed.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA may itself physically impede the binding of transcriptional regulators to the gene, and more importantly, methylated DNA participates in the formation of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modifications such as the histone code, polycomb complexes, nucleosome positioning, noncoding RNA, and ATPdependent chromatin remodeling proteins. The hypermethylation of imprint control region is common features of the cancer cell. The cancer cell display loss of imprinting. The genes that should be displaying monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, they're imprinted no longer, show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed from parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. Locus-specific hypermethylation usually occurs at promoter CGIs of tumor suppressor genes, resulting in heritable transcriptional silencing.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation arises mainly from loss of methylation at normally heavily methylated repeat elements, including satellites and retrotransposons, leading to genomic instability and oncogene activation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation can also affect histone modifications and chromatin structure, which, in turn, can alter gene expression. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. The IGF2R gene, although differentially methylated on maternal and paternal alleles, is transcribed from both alleles in the vast majority of the population. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, biallelic expression of <em>IGF2</em> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a differentially methylated regions (DMR) in <em>IGF2.</em> This DMR, known as DMR0, has been shown to be methylated on the silent maternal <em>IGF2</em> allele presumably with a role in repression. Biallelic expression, resulting hypothetically in double the growth factor dosage, may explain not only the somatic, but may also play a role in tumour development.</p>
<p>In tumors, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. Loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="intra_ref"><strong>Decitabine belongs to the inhibitors of DNA methylation.</strong></p>
<p class="intra_ref">This is accomplished by inhibit the expression of the de novo DNA methylating enzymes, DNMT3B. All this helps to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by aberrant methylation.Decitabine also plays an important role in inducing cell cycle arrest, and cell death in vitro in cancer cells  and decitabine exposure to cancer cells causes the up-regulation of cell cycle-associated genes, such as the Cdk inhibitors p14, p15, or p16, and genes related to the induction of apoptosis, such as caspase-8 or Apaf-1, that are silenced by hypermethylation. As a consequence, decitabine induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. On the other hand, decitabine can form complexes with DNA-DNMTs that induce DNA damage and cytotoxicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation in gene promoter regions results in gene silencing likely because of steric inhibition of transcription complexes binding to regulatory DNA, also can result in the recruitment of proteins that bind methylated CpG sequences (methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins) complexed with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and HMTs prompting coordinated epigenetic modifications of the surrounding chromatin. If these processes are not regulated in sensitive period like gametogenesis and early embryogenesis, the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. In other words, DNA methylation is a mark must be that correctly established in the germline, and maintained throughout life, being erased and reestablished in the germline the next generation. Therefore if you perform a treatment that alters the dna methylation during sensitive periods could result in the transmission of changes in the epigenome in the following cell lines. </p>
