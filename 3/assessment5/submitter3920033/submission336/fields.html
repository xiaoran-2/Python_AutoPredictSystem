    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Tne effect of DNA methylation in cancer is methylation of  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. In healthy cells, these CpG islands are typically unmethylated. Their methylation then leads to silencing of the genes. Hence, if CpG islands in tumour suppressor genes are erroneously hypermethylated, these genes will not be expressed and there will be loss of the tumour suppressing function. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repeats are usually unmethylated in healthy cells. This is to help maintain genomic stability. Hence, if these regions get erroneously hypomethylated, the genome can get unstable. This can mean for instance that some repeats combine or get activated. Such hypomethylation and resulting genomic instability has been found in many types of cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Imprinting is an epigenetic process in which genes are silenced in a parent-of-origin specific way. Disturbances in the imprinting patterns can contribute to cancer if the affected genes play a role in either tumour suppression or promotion. For example, in Wilms Tumour, the imprint control region (ICR) affecting the H19/Igf2 cluster is disturbed. In normal cells, H19 is expressed on the maternal allele, and due to the binding of CTCF to DNA and subsequent insulation of Igf2 from downstream enhancers, Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele. In contrast, on the paternal allele, methylation prevents the binding of CTCF, so the enhancers act on Igf2 and activate this gene, so Igf2 is expressed. Methylation also spreads on the H19 promoter, so H19 is not expressed on the paternal allele. In Wilms tumour, hypermethylation of the CTCF binding site and also the H19 promoter on the maternal allele blocks gives access of the enhancers to the Igf2 site, so Igf2 is overexpressed. Igf2 is a growth factor, so its excessive expression can lead to excessive growth such as a tumour.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Hypermethylated of a tumour suppressor gene can lead to a reduction or stop of expression of this gene and hence to the loss of the tumour suppressing function. If one inhibits methyltransferase, hypermethylation of those genes can be reversed and tumour suppressing function can be restored. D</span>ecitabine is such a DNA-demethylating agent. It is used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, which are precursors to acute myelogenous leukemia, and acts by demethylating tumour <span><span>suppressor </span></span>genes.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation patterns are passed on to daughter cells after cell division. Hence, the effect of drugs which alter the methylation pattern will be permanent (unless the affected cells die or are subject to further epigenetic modifications). During most periods of adult life, epigenetic patterns remain relatively stable. There are, however, sensitive periods, which are periods where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. This happens upon fertilisation, and in development of primordial germ cells. During those periods, treatment with drugs altering DNA methylation could lead to permanent changes in the methylation patterns for genes different to those one intends to treat. Normal function associated with those genes could be permanently changed, leading to abnormal growth or death of the embryo in the case of treatment of a pregnant woman, or infertility or abnormalities in germ cells if treatment occurs during development of primordial germ cells.</p></div>
