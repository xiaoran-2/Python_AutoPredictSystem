    <div class="field-value"><p>CPG islands are usually found at promoyers of genes like promotor of tumour supressor gene. In normal cell CPG islands are usually hypomethylated, &amp; intergenic regions &amp; repetative elements are methylated i.e when CPGs are hypomethylated they allow gene expression &amp; hypermethylation at repeates &amp; intergenic regions are involved in maintaining genomic stability by preventng 1) deletion, insertion, reciprocal translocation, duplicatin etc by the methylation of intergenic region &amp; 2) transpodition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, recombinations as by the methyllation in repeats. In contrast in a cancer cell one can find 1)CPG island hypermethylation &amp; 2)repeats &amp; intergenic region hypomethylation, leading to supression of gene expression &amp; genomic instability. The hypermethylation of CPGs can prevent the expression of an essential protein like synthesis of a tumour supressor can be prevented by methylation of its CPG island which can cause an adverse effect leading to cancer. Simillarly hypomethylationof eiiyher the repeats dan go on to produce unwanted protein which may have an adverse effect and also defficiency of required protein, hypomethylation of intergenic region can lead to unwanted recombinations and can hinder the normal functioning of the body. Thus unrelavent methylation of CPG islands or repeats or intergenic region can lead to disruption of the actiities of  the gene leading to its supression, transcription of unwanted protein, mutations  etc contibuting to cancer and other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the commonfeature of cancer cells is that they loose imprinting. In a normal cell, H19/Igf2 is paternally imprinted gene, Igf2 is mainly involved in promotion of growth of the cell. The Imprint Control Region (ICR) of H19/Igf2 of maternal chromosome is unmethylated due to which insulators like CTCFs bind to itd ICR &amp; prevent the experssion of Igf2 due to which the enhancers express H19 expression, whereas ICR of H19/Igf2 of paternal chromosome is methylated due to which enhancers act on Igf2 leading to its expression, thus maintaining normal amountof Igf2 for the growth of the cell. Thus when ICR of the maternal chromosome is methylated due to genetic or epigenetic mistake, enhancers act on Igf2 leading to its expression from maternal chromosome as well relating to its double expression,thus promoting growth than in normal limit eg cancer cells. This is the background of WILMS Tumour, where both the parental allils are involved in the production of Igf2 leading to childhood kidney tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic alterations are reversible, thus this concept is used in the treatment of cancer. Small chemical molecules (drugs) which can specifically target enzymatic epigenetic regulators which act to lay down/ remove epigenetic mark are used in the treatment of cancer. Decitabine is one such drug which is involved in DNA methyl transferase inhibition(DNMTi). This drug at an appropriate quantity has anti-neo plastic effect. i.e they kill tumour cells as they are involved in inhibition of DNA methylation. This drug gets incorporated into the DNA and when DNMT1 comes to bind with nucleotides it binds irreversibly and thus the tumour cells are affected. Thus Decitabine acts to prevent DNA methylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNMTi acts on cancer cells to cause adverse effect. But as these drugs are being taken they can affect the normal cells of the body as well during their replication. This can lead long term consequences which can affect the patients. Use of these drugs during sensitive periods; i.e slow growth periods[9-12 yrs in Males, 8-10 yrs and feotal life in Females] i.e the period when there are still germ cell maturation taking place. Treating patients with drugs at these sensitive periods also affect next generation as the germ cells are still in the period of development. This implies that the drugs can act on the germ cells and disrupt the epigenetics of the normal regions of the chromose leading to unknown adverse effect in the offsprings. Thus treating patients during sensitive periods is not advisable</p></div>
