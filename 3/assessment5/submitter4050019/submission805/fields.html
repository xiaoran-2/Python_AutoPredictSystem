    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group, which alters the expression of genes in cells. There are two types of DNA methylation, locus specific DNA hypermethylation and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. At the CpG islands the methylation occurring silences the gene expression. In normal cells the CpG island is methylated and the other areas are methylated while in cancer cells it is the opposite, CpG island is methylated and the other areas a unmethylated. When a person has cancer, there is hypermethylation at the CpG island shores which links to gene expression and with clinically distinct tumours. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated and the function of DNA methylation in both is to maintain genomic stability. In cancer there is hypomethylation, which causes the genomic instability. In repetitive elements, the methylation silences the repeats to prevent transposition and improper recombination. From the mouse models we see that the hypomethylation is due to the deletion of the Dnmt1 in certain tissue types, which in turn increases the genomic instability. There is illegitimate recombination between the repeats, the activation of repeats and transposition and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele there is rapid and active demethylation from the gametes to the epiblast and in the maternal allele, there is passive demethylation. Both the maternal and paternal alleles contains the Igf2 cluster, the ICR and the enhancers. The DNA methylation at the ICR blocks the binding the CTCF insulator protein from binding, in the paternal allele. This in turn silences the H19 promoter and the enhancers can activate the Igf2 cluster. However, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated hence the CTCF protein binds to it which shields the Igf2 from the enhancers, making the H19 promoter active. Alterations in imprinting such hypermethylation can lead to Wilm’s tumour. This occurs because of the overexpression of the Igf2 cluster since there is more methylation of the ICR. This makes the maternal allele look and function like the paternal allele giving two paternal alleles. Disruptions imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. Like in the Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents and is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Since Decitabine is HDAC inhibitor, the acetyl are groups removed by histone deacetylases and modifies the chromatin and nucleosome. In the article "Cancer's epicentre", Stephen Baylin at John Hopkins School of Medicine, shows research on the combination of <span>histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed down the growth of the tumour in patients with p</span>rogressive lung cancer. Therefore the Decitabine has had similar effect and Dr Bayling says that they change the tumour cells and made it more vulnerable to chemotherapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is laid down by be novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals maintained by DNMT1. Hence when altered, it is sustained by DNMT1 therefore it stays in the epigenome giving it the lasting effects. This makes the epigenetic drugs that alter the DNA methylation have effects that remain beyond the period of drug treatment. Periods of epigenetic reprogramming which are during the early development and primordial germ cell development are called sensitive periods. During these during sensitive periods it is unwise to treat patients because the epigenome is more susceptible to alterations in the genes which are not supposed to be there. As a result, disorders are more likely to occur in these patients if treated during these critical phases. </p></div>
