    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are sites in the genetic code with high GC content (also called CpG-rich regions). The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. However, in about 60% of promoters, these CpG islands are kept unmethylated - gene silencing and activation is accomplished through alternative means. In cancer, what essentially happens is that the aforesaid CpG islands (previously hypomethylated) become hypermethylated (increased DNA methylation), resulting in relatively permanent gene silencing. DNA methylation in the body is cell-type specific -- DNA methylation patterns dictate chromatin structure, strict control over transcription, as well as differentiation in progenitor cells. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands can, therefore, literally cause havoc in the cell. <br />DNA methylation also occurs between genes as well as in the introns, and is responsible for inhibiting the activity of viral elements in the genome, such as DNA transposons and retrotransposons -- elements that increase the probability of illegitimate crossovers during DNA replication (preceding cell division). In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements (e.g. IAPs) become hypomethylated -- and are not silenced anymore. The aforementioned transposons can create mutations in protein-coding regions, which code for critical enzymes involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g. tumor suppressors, and so on) -- resulting in pathology.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is basically a hypomethylating agent (also known as a DNA demethylating agent) and it works by getting incorporating into a targeted gene and avoiding methylation. Decitabine is essentially a cytosine analog which cannot be methylated by DNA methyltransferases. This is the mechanism by which it works. The overall impact the drug has is to reduce DNA methylation in otherwise methylated target genes (so that they may be expressed). We know that a hypermethylation of CpG islands is observed in cancer pathologies. Therefore, targeting decitabine to those particular methylated CpG islands can (to some degree) slow down tumorigenesis. This pattern of DNA methylation will then be passed on to progenitor cells through mitosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As mentioned above, DNA methylation patterns are conserved in daughter cells. With some exceptions, this is generally the case. The exceptions include the so-called 'sensitive' periods -- periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when DNA methylation patterns are erased for the most part. For instance, during gametogenesis (in both males and females) and after fertilization in the embryo. Treating patients with drugs or chemotherapy during this time would be inadvisable, as the acquired epigenetic changes during this time would be inherited by the children of the patient. A mutation acquired through chemotherapy or drug, for instance, has the potential to be detrimental to the new-born. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 are examples of genetically imprinted regions -- i.e. each is expressed from only one allele (from either the mother's or the father's). Igf2 is paternally imprinted (activated only on the paternal allele) and is activated by enhancers present downstream from the gene's promoter. On the paternal allele, downstream of Igf2, there is a methylated imprint control region (ICR) as well as a methylated H19 (a long non-coding RNA or lncRNA) promoter. On the other hand, on the maternal allele, Igf2 is protected from the enhancers indirectly by CTCF (an insulator protein). CTCF accomplishes this by binding to the ICR on the maternal allele and redirecting the enhancers to the H19 promoter instead. A common epigenetic alternation in Wilm's tumor patients is the increased expression of Igf2 (a gene encoding 'insulin-like growth factor II'), an oncogene -- responsible for growth promoting activities (e.g. cell division). Overexpression of Igf2 has the potential for initiating tumorigenesis. Another common pathology associated with disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (gigantism). </p></div>
