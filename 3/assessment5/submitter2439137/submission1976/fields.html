    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues.However, in cancer cells CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. These are done by modifying DNA, histone proteins and nucleosome density/composition, which have downstream effect on the genes that are related to different diseases. Because some vital genes, for example, the tumour suppressor gene is turned off, thus increasing the chance of developing cancer. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to turn off the gene expressions that are not necessay or sometimes dangerous, because these regions are usually being the landing pad for retrotransposons. In cancer cells, the genes in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be not methylated, thus genes are expressed. This would lead to some dangerous genes expression, which in turns, cause diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation at the imprinting control regions (ICRs) can contribute to cancer, one example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cell, the ICR is not available for the CTCF protein binding in the paternal allele, thus the enhancers can boost the expression of Igf2 gene but block the H19 expression. Whereas, in the maternal allele, the ICR is binding to the CTCF protein so that the enhancer cannot jump to the Igf2 gene region, therefore the Igf2 is not expressed, but H19 is able to express due to the interaction with the enhancers. In the Wilm's tumour, the ICR in materanl allele is not binding to the CTCF and the H19 promotor is methylated which is not suppose to be, this cause the expression of Igf2 in the maternal allele. The end result is the double dose expression of the Igf2 in the person. Since the Igf2 is a growth promoting factor, the double dose expression leads the person to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Decitabine is cytidine nucleoside analogs that become incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, where they bind DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in an irreversible, covalent manner. The sequestration of DNMTs prevents maintenance of the methylation state of DNA, leading to DNA hypomethylation. As a consequence, genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed upon treating cancer cell lines with these DNMT inhibitors. Re-expression of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptotic pathways is believed to contribute to the anticancer effects of these drugs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation causes the silencing of gene expressions. It belongs to epigenetic changes which alters gene expressions without changing the DNA sequences. The epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to the next generation until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. The sensitive periods of development are when epigenetic reprogramming takes place, which refers to the early development and the primordial germ cell development. During these periods, the epigenetic marks are erased and re-estalished. Therefore, treating patients during these sensitive periods has the potential of disturbing the epigenetic state, which would be inadvisable.</p></div>
