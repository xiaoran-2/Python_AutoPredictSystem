    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation at CpG islands is one of the mechanics that commonly goes awry when cancer infects a patient. Under normal circumstances, CpG islands throughout the genome usually maintain an unmethylated status and therefore are active. However, when cancer affects a person's cells, the CpG islands that are usually unmethylated, become methylated and silenced. Therefore the proteins that code for tumour suppressors that are produced from unmethylated CpG islands and CpG island shores, become unexpressed, causing the tumor suppressors to not be produced. The lack of tumour suppressors caused by the hypermethylation of CpG islands (ie. the blockage of gene expression by the methylation) causes the disease to progress and the tumour to grow. Downstream from the CpG islands are the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements. In a healthy person (without cancer), these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, in other words silenced, in order to increase genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of strong promoters that could disrupt neighboring genes. On the other hand, when a person is infected by cancer, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are unmethylated and therefore activated, which causes genomic instability by reciprocal translocations, and nucleotide/s deletion and insertion. The activations of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease because it allows for transposable mutations and insertion and deletion mutations to occur to the genome, which will then cause genomic instability, and the affected cell to mitotically pass on its mutations and therefore increase the number of cancerous and harmful cells.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In a normal human cell and a cancerous cell, the methylation pattern of the H19/Igf2 cluster differs between the paternal and maternal alleles. The paternal allele in a healthy human is methylated at the Imprint control region and therefore the enhancers activate Igf2 since H19 is methylated (since CTCF could not bind to a methylated ICR). On the maternal allele in a healthy human, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF 4 to bind to the insulator element, which causes the enhancers to activate H19 instead of Igf2. When a human is affected by Wilm's tumour, the methylation on the maternal allele changes. The ICR, instead of being unmethylated, is hypermethylated and therefore expresses Igf2. This causes an overproduction of Igf2, (double the normal amount of Igf2 in a healthy cell) which causes an overexpression of growth promoting genes and therefore Wilm's tumour, which is a tumour in the kidneys.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Cancer can be cured epigenetically. One of the drugs that can do this is Decitabine, which belongs to the class of  DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and is prescribed to help cure myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is also classified as an"antimetabolite" and a "demethylation" agent. Decitabine is nucleoside analogues and irreversibly binds to DNMT's after they are incorporated into the DNA  and then prevents the DNMT of replicated cells from putting down methylation marks. The demethylation reinstates the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes and restores the cells control over cell growth. Acting as a antimetabolite, Decitabine interacts with targets inside the cell to have a direct cytotoxic effect that will kill cancer cells.The inhibitor Decitabine (DNMTi) is given at relatively low levels since this causes a high rate of DNA demethylation while a large dose of DNMTi's are toxic and nonspecific.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have long term effects on the epigenome. For example, both the  DNMT and HDAC inhibitors are nonspecific for cancer cells and therefore through cell replication, these inhibitors are passed epigenetically onto normal cells. Also, it is still unclear whether the inhibitors have other effects on the epigenome besides inhibition. Even if the drug is no longer being given to a patient, these cells methylation marks are epigenetically changed and therefore will be mitotically passed on and not disappear even after the drugs have been stopped. In adults, it is usually safe to treat using these drugs that change the epigenetic marks since they are hard to modify completely since adults have reached maturity. However children or fetuses in sensitive periods should not take the drugs. A sensitive period is when most epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed such as in germ cell development and early embryonic (preimplantation) development, which occur in mid-gestation embryo and blastocyst.  Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs affect all cells and therefore the drugs would tamper with the correct development and epigenetic marks of stem cells that are the basis for all cells in the body.</span></p></div>
