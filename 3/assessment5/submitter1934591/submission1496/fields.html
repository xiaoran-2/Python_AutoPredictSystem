    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands generally tends to modulate gene expression, as CpG islands generally contain transcription factor binding sites and are regulatory regions for associated/nearby genes.   DNA methylation at CpG islands tends to increase during cancer progression, which can switch off tumour suppressor genes (e.g. RB, MLH1, BRCA1) which normally inhibit cancer progression, and can also lead to loss of imprinting.   These changes often gives abnormal cells a growth advantage over surrounding “normal” cells.   Furthermore, these silencing effects can synergise with other mutations and activating/silencing events to lead to tumourigenesis (Knudson three hit hypothesis).   Increases in CpG islands also accumulate with age and so contribute to age related disease.   Analysis of CpG island methylation can be useful in the diagnosis, prognosis and also choice of treatment in several types of cancer.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which make up the vast majority of the genome, conversely, tends to be high in normal cells but decreases during cancer progression. This can lead to unwanted transcription from cryptic promoter elements and also leads to genomic instability which can lead to the karyotypic abnormalities (e.g. deletions and insertions) which can lead to tumourigenesis.   Loss of methylation can also directly affect  the transcription of some genes associated with tumourigenesis, such as in the activation of CpG-poor promoter genes (e.g. R-RAS).</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster in normal cells, the ICR region is methylated on the paternal allele which does not allow CTCF to bind and therefore the enhancers do not allow for H19 expression but do allow for Igf2 expression.   Conversely, at the maternal allele in normal cells, the ICR is not methylated and allows Ctcf to bind allowing the upstream enhancers to activate H19 expression but not Igf2 expression.   In Wilms tumour, we see loss of imprinting, that is the methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, leading to loss of H19 expression and the expression of Igf2 from both alleles.   Igf2 is known to be a potent growth promoting gene, which can lead to the tumourigenesis, as is seen for Wilms tumour, a childhood kidney cancer.  This type of dysregulation is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, suggesting that dysregulation of ICRs is an early event in tumourigenesis and may allow for the accumulation of other epigenetic or genetic alterations leading to tumourigenesis.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a cytidine analogue and a potent DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which can be incorporated into DNA during replication.   Decitabine treatment can inhibit/reverse hypermethylation of CpG islands which regulate tumour suppressor gene expression which is often seen during cancer progression, as its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases inhibiting their function.   Decitabine has been very useful in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myelodysplastic syndromes through its reversal of unwanted CpG methylation and also through its direct cytotoxicity.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and therefore inhibiting DNA methylation will affect gene expression after DNA replication and cell division.   This includes a simple, direct effect on one gene, but also, if the gene which is altered can affect further epigenetic changes, such as a epigenetic modifying enzyme, an epigenetic remodeler or a piRNA or lncRNA, a change in DNA methylation can affect a downstream changes in further epigenetic marks which can affect gene expression which is passed down after replication.   Therefore, drugs which affect DNA methylation may have profound effects on periods after treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive period describes a time where the epigenome is very sensitive to changes, and can be affected by environmental factors, and also by “epigenetic drugs”.  During development, the two sensitive periods are 1) primodrial germ cell development through to the production of gametes, and 2) post-implantation and early post-implantation periods.    Both are periods of active epigenetic remodeling, and therefore  it would be inadvisable to disrupt this stage as changes would be inherited and would greatly affect normal development, leading to tumorigenesis, disease amongst other effects.   Ultimately, changes during these sensitive periods will affect subsequent generations due to the mitotic heritability of epigenetic marks.</p></div>
