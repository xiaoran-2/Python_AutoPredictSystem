    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are sometimes methylated.  This silences a gene or group of genes downstream of the methylated CpG island.  In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, silencing genes that are normally active, like tumor suppressors or growth regulators.  This allows the tumor to grow unchecked.  Also, irregular CpG methylation can lead to genetic and epigenetic mutation.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated to prevent genomic instability, like transposons inserting themselves elsewhere in the genome.  These regions are usually unmethylated in cancer, leading to further genetic and epigenetic mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the H19/lgf2 cluster has four CTCF binding sites.  There is also a set of inhancers that can be used by either H19 or lgf2.  In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding.  When bound to the ICR, CTCF inhibits transcription of lgf2, but when it cannot bind, lgf2 is transcribed and uses the inhancers.  CTCF binding is required for transcription of H19, so H19 cannot be transcribed.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF can bind, blocking transcription of lgf2.  H19 is free to be transcribed and to use the inhancers.  This pattern is disrupted in Wilm's tumor.  The ICR is methylated on both the maternal and paternal allele, causing overexpression of Igf2.  Igf2 contains growth factor II, so an overexpression of Igf2 would help a tumor grow.  (Genomic imprinting: recognition and marking of imprinted loci.  Abramowitz, Lara K. and Marisa S.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor. It works by incorporating itself into the DNA and binding to DNMT1, inhibiting methylation.  The effects of Deacitabine include upregulation of DNA repair enzymes and the activation of previously methylated tumor suppressor genes.  It also acts as an antineoplastic agent.  (Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (deaditabine) in the design of its dose-schedule for cancer therapy.  Karahoca, Metin and Richard L Momparler.)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so even after epigenetic drugs are no longer administered to a patient, the altered methylation patterns are still present.  Sensitive periods are periods of development when the DNA methylation pattern is especially vulnerable to alteration by outside factors.  Sensitive periods occor during pre-implantation, germ cell developement, and early childhood (birth--6 years).  It would not be wise to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods because altering methylation at that time could lead to abnormal methylation patterns, which in turn could lead to disease later in life.  (Child Health, Developmental Plasticity, and Epigenetic Programming.  Z.
