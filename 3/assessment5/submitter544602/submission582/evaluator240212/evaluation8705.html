    <div class="field-value">Q1:
Good structure, however some statements are unprecise or even wrong (What do you mean by ´gene products´? Repetitive elements are not created, they are regions of the DNA, not transcribed sequences such as RNA. CpG rich regions are generally not found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements; Do you mean the genes promoter?).
You only mention the (lack of) methylation of CpG islands, but don´t mention the function of this. Regarding the disruption of the methylation patterns of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, your answer includes contributions to genomic instability, but does not include the consequences of these.
Q2:
great answer!
Q3:
Good answer, but comes short in explaining how cancer cells are more affected by the lack of DNMT than normal cells.
Q4:
Generally pretty good, but there is a few points:
Methylation pattern is not part of the genome, but of the epigenome. Also do the epigenetic drug alter the methylation pattern of the epigenome, not just the cancer epigenome, but since cancer cells divide much more rapidly, and the methylations are more numerous (rather small amount of CpG island genes relative to the number of intergenic regions and repetitive elements), they are much stronger effected by the epigenetic drugs.
This sentence is not very comprehendable (what do you mean?): 'Even the alteration of the methylation pattern of the cancer cells did not stop the cancer growth but may have weaken its resistance to other interventions such as chemo drugs.'</div>
