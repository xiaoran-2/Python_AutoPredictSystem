    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Even though over 70% of CpG of mammalian somatic DNA  are methylated, the CpG island are usually clear of methylation. This is true regardless whether the associated gene is expressed.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these CpG islands are often found to be hypermethylated. This leads to the silencing of the associated genes. As a result gene products that are normally available for this cell may not be available. </p>
<p>For intergenic regions and repetitive elements, CpG are mostly methylated under normal circumstances. This means the non-coding RNA and repetive elements associated with such areas are often not created.</p>
<p>in cancer cells these CpG locations are often not methylated. this allow the creation of non coding RNA and respective elements. These non coding RNA may bind to DNA and RNA and hence interrupt or alter the normal cell functions. The respective elements can frequently plan itself to other part of the genome and create additional mutations and DNA damages.</p>
<p>By changing the DNA methylation pattern, the cancer cell may fail to perform its normal functions and may engage in other non-normal activities. It can also create additional mutations and DNA damages.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In human, downstream of the gene Igf2 is an imprint control region (ICR) followed by the gene H19 and followed by a few enhancers. Normally, the ICR for paternally inherited chromosome is methylated while the maternally inherited one is not. For the maternally inherited chromosome, the ICR is open allowing the binding with a transcriptional repressor CTCF. The enhencer is allowed to act with H19 and H19 is expressed and with CTCF to insolate the Igf2, Igf2 is silenced. For the paternally inherited chromosome, the ICR and the promoter of H19 are methylated. No CTCF binding to insolate Igf2. This silences the gene H19 and allows the promoters to activate the gene Igf2. Basically, the inprinting mechanic allows exactly one copy of Igf2 to be active.</p>
<p>If this area of both chromosomes are methylated known as hypermethylated, both ICRs are methylated and CTCF cannot bind and therefore are not there to insolate one of the Igf2. As a result, both Igf2 genes are expressed and both H19 are silenced. This would create abnormally high amount of insulin-like grow factors resulting a growth known as Wilm's tumor, a childhood cancer of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p>
<p>Decitabine can inhibit DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and hence reduce the rate of DNA methylation. In particular Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, that can act like nucleoside in DNA synthesis. It binds DNMT irreversibly after they are incorporated into the DNA. Therefore they are replication dependent and hence it affects cancer cells more than they affect normal cells. Decitabine reduces the  DNA methylation of the cancer cells significantly while the normal cells have only mild effects. As a result Decitabine has effects on cancers that rely on DNA hypermethylation such as myelodysplatics syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Dr Baylin's speculation is conceptually possible as the epigenetic drugs alter the methylation pattern of the cancer genome. As the cancer cells replicates, the new methylation pattern are passed to the daughter cells. Even the alteration of the methylation pattern of the cancer cells did not stop the cancer growth but may have weaken its resistance to other interventions such as chemo drugs.</span></p>
<p><span>The sensitive periods are when epigenetic markers can be altered easily by external environments. That is when the cells undergo overall clearing and laying the epigenetic markers. This happens immediately after fertilization through the formation of the epiblast, the period surrounding the implantation of a fertilized egg. It also happens when the primordial germ cells are developing into gametes. During these sensitive periods, treating patients with an epigenetic agent can alter the epigenetic states of the fertilized egg or the primordial germ cells. If a fertizated eggs/primodial stem cell is affected it may result in diseases and conditions of the unborn child/gamete. If a gamete is affected, it may impact its ability to fertilize or be fertilized. In both cases conditions and diseases may result for the future child.</span></p></div>
