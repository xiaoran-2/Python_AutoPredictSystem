    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a healthy cell, the CpG islands are typically hypomethylated, whereas the genomic, the intergenic regions, the introns, and the repetitive regions are hypermethylated.   In a cancerous cell, the CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated, and the genome that was hypermethylated in the healthy cell, is hypomethylated.  The patterns of methylation between a healthy and a cancerous cell are ostensibly reversed.  It is the silencing of the promoters of tumor supressing genes by CpG island methylation, an occurrence more frequent than mutation, which can often lead to cancer.  Knutson's hypothesis in 1953, stating that multiple causes or "multiple hits" to DNA are required to cause cancer, allows for both the activation of proto-oncogenes as well as the more recent discovery of the epigenetic and mitotically heritable hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer.</p>
<p>The methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is a normal way of ensuring genomic stability, largely by preventing abnormal recombination and translocation when DNA is tightly packaged in heterochromatin.  Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repeats in a cancerous cell is associated with an increased frequency of inappropriate translocations and an increase in the number of repeats in what is now more loosely packed DNA, as well as the activation of promoters which had previously been silent.  It is this dysregulation which results in the formation of cancers through the increased number of insertions, deletions, and reciprocal translocations.  DNA hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result is the activation of oncogenes, as well as the hypomethylation of a miRNA, which in turn may silence a tumor suppressor.    </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While some epigenetic drugs are still waiting in the wings for their first human trials, Decitabine is already being successfully used in the treatment of myeldysplastic syndromes, which, when untreated, frequently lead to acute myelogenous leukemia.  Decitabine, which is sold under the label <em>Dacogen,</em> is a DNA-demethylating agent that has been shown to slow the growth of advanced lung cancer when used in combination with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor. It is presumed that these drugs, when used in tandem, can remove some of the layers of methylation on the tumor-suppressing genes in a permanent and mitiotically heritable way, allowing these genes to resume some of their tumor-suppressing function.  These effects were seen in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs, and it is thought that the epigenetic drugs made the hard tumor more susceptible to the therapy when tumors of this type had previously been difficult to penetrate.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Every cell in the body will be affected by the use of epigenetic drugs, so while mitotically heritable epigenetic changes can benefit the cancer patient by erasing or altering some of the deleterious epigenetic modifiers, these same drugs could cause unknown consequences to the epigenome of germ cells of a patient in a sensitive period of development. These changes could cause imprinting disorders (seen in the maternally transmitted Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Angelman syndrome) thereby becoming meiotically heritable and having transgenerational implications. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when the epigenetic marks required for genomic stability are being established, or when there is <em>active remodeling.</em>  The first sensitive period would begin at the time of the primordial germ cell development and go all the way through to the time when mature eggs and sperm are being produced.  The second sensitive period is that of pre-implantation and early post-implantation.  There is a period of somatic maintenance between these sensitive periods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until more is known about how each drug works, and the full nature of the mitotically and possibly meiotically heritable traits brought about from these epigenetic treatments, extreme consideration must be given to their use in patients during sensitive periods of reprogramming. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Looking at the H19/Igf2 cluster of the paternal allele in a healthy cell, Igf2 is expressed due to both the ICR (imprint control region) and the H19 promoter being hypermethylated allowing the downstream enhancers to express the growth-promoting Igf2 gene.  Normally, the expression of the paternal Igf2 gene is balanced by the monoallelic imprinting of the maternal allele; a pattern in which Igf2 is methylated and the ICR is hypomethylated allowing the insulator CTCF to bind to it.  This results in the enhancers acting on H19 in the imprinted maternal allele, rather than Igf2, as in the paternal allele. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This pattern is disrupted when there is a loss of parent-of-origin, monoallelic imprinting, often resulting in Wilm’s tumor – a type of pediatric kidney cancer.  Without the imprinting of Igf2 on the maternal allele, as well as the hypermethylation of the maternal ICR preventing the protective CTCF from binding to the imprint control region, the maternal allele now expresses Igf2 as well as the paternal allele.  As Igf2 is growth promoting, the inappropriate expression of Igf2 by the maternal allele leads to a double dose of Igf2 resulting in disease in the form of Wilm’s tumor. </p></div>
