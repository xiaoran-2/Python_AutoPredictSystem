    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

Some standard chemo drugs are unable to work on these patients because chemo drugs require a certain enzyme to work properly. However, in some cancers, the enzyme that is required can no longer made by the cell due to the gene and its promotor have been turned off by hypermethalation. By removing some of the excess methyation, the gene may be able to again make the required enzymes, which will make the chemo drug work more effectually. Since using drugs that target the epigenetics of cells, it is important to consider the age of the patient as any drug that methylates or acetyates the histones and the DNA will change the expression of the genes in such a way that would be passed on to offspring through the germ cells. Perhaps all of the epigentic changes will not be good. So, young people whose germ cells are still developing should not be considered for this type of treatment. The modifications made to their DNA through this type of treatment would be forever and inheritable to their children.</span></div></div>

    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;

If the p53 gene has been hypermethylated than the p53 gene will not be expressed. P53 is a tumor suppressor gene which prevents tumor cells from growing by causing the defective cell to undergo apototsis (programed cell death). Research has shown that almost all cancers show hypermethylation of the CpG islands and the CpG island shores,. It is believed that Decitabine works by reversing some of the excess methylation at the CpG islands (and CpG island shores) and help return the cancer cells to their pre-cancer methylation state.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>

    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

In mammels, normally the insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) gene is subjected to imprinting, so that the copy of the Igf2 gene from the mother is silenced but the H19 gene from the mother is expressed.  The copy of the Igf2 gene from the father is expressed, but not the H19 gene from the father. This silencing of the Igf2 gene from the mother happens through methylation of which causes this gene (from the mother) not to be express. If both copies of the IGF2 gene are active due to loss of imprinting, or from a genetic mutation, then both the Igf2 from the mother and the father are expressed. This causes too much </span></span><span>insulin-like growth factor</span><span> is produced</span><span>. The H19 gene decreases growth while the Igf2 gene promotes cell growth. When too much IGF2 is expressed and the H19 gene is not expressed than cells grow too quickly and divide too often which may lead to cancer. Since the Igf2 gene promotes growth and then excess expression of Igf2 can lead to tumor growth.</span></div></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The cells of our body all have the same DNA, however, our cells are not all alike.The genes that need to be expressed in our liver cells are different from the genes that are expressed in our skin cells. Not all areas of our DNA need to be expressed in all cells all the time. Our cells controll what genes will be express through the use of histones, chromatin.and methylation modifications of the DNA. Areas of our DNA that do not need to be expressed in a certain cell type are very tightly compacted to keep the DNA reading machinery out of that area and prevent transcription of that area of the genes. We have areas of our genome which consists of repeats. These repeats are belived to be anceint viruses that have become part of our DNA over time. Some viruses have been linked to cancers. Because of this, the repeats areas are always heavly methylated to prevent those genes from being expressed.  In non-cancerous cells, the areas of the genome which should be expressed such as CpG islands and their promotors tend to be lightly methylated, however, in cancer cells, the CpG islands (and the island shores) tend to be hypermethylated and these genes which are supposed to be expressed are now silenced. Genes which are required for regulation of growth and division such as the tumor suppresor gene p53 also tend to by hypermethylated so they are no longer expressed. The p53 gene is involved in triggering apoptosis (programed cell death) in those cells which have mutations which may lead to cancer. In cancer cells, the genes that had previously had been highly methylated such as the repeats are now hypomethylated and these genes which has previously been silenced are now expressed.</p></div>
