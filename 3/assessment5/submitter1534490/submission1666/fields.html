    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation carry out different roles in the overall genome. Normal cells use to have hypomethylated CpG islands while intergenic regions and repetitive elements use to be methylated. Shortly, low methylation in gene promoters facilitate their expression and the methylation of gene body helps to maintain genomic stability. In contrast, cancer cells are more luckily to be hypermethylated in CpG islands but hypomethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG islands hypermethylation causes silencing of the underlying gene, for example a tumour suppressor gene.</span></span></span></span><strong><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span> </span></span></span></span></span></strong><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">It is important to mention CpG island methylation phenotyope (CIMP) which was first defined in colorectal cancer and includes CpG islands of a set of genes frequently methylated in a tumor type. One of the difficulties of this disease is that there are different methylation patterns depending on the tumor type.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes. The consequence of hypomethylation of this zones depends on the location. In the case of repeats and intergenic regions, the hypomethylation leads to genomic instability: repeats recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. On the other hand, the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters provoke oncogene activation.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Another important effect of methylation disruption is the loss of imprinting. In this case the alteration can occur both for hypo or hypermethylation and can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>It is important to mention that cancer is not the effect of one of this factors but the result of multiples hits of DNA. This means that for both diagnosis, prognosis and treatment it is important to study the combination of the mentioned epigenetic processes and the genetic ones.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Deacitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used for the treatment myelodysplastic syndromes. This drug hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase during the replication, therefore it is a DNMT inhibitor. During replication Deacitabine (</span></span></span><strong><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) </span></span></span></strong><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>which is a nucleotide analog, is introduced in the DNA sequence and in the subsequent steps, when DNMT tries to copy the methylation pattern to the daughter strand, the enzyme is bound irreversibly and can not longer be released. As this effect is cell division dependent, tumour cells are more affected that normal cells. </span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>This drug is not specific, so it demethylates cancer and normal cells in all the genome and not only the hypermethylated promoter of interest. This leads to inconvenient secondary effects and right now we have no idea of the long term effects. Anyway a lot of patients that had not a good response to normal chemotherapeutic treatments responded extremely well to DNA-demethylating agents.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>DNA methylation is generally transmitted to daughter cells with high fidelity. The use of drugs as DNMT inhibitors leads to a change of DNA pattern that will be transmitted to daughter cells. Therefore, the alteration of the methylation pattern is perdurable to the following generations.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Sensitive periods are occur when the epigenetic marks are not yet established. In development there are two sensitive periods: germ cell development and early development. During these periods, the methylation patterns are completely eliminated and reestablished. In this point the use of this of drugs that alter the methylation pattern </span></span></span></span>affect all kind of cells and can evoke to a completely demethylated genome which will not be recuperated.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>One of the common features of cancer cells is that they lose the heritable imprinting and they present expression or silence for bot alleles. It is a common early event often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue. The alteration of DNA methylation at Imprinting Control Regions (both hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restriction genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>An example of this event is the hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression. In normal cells, the paternal allele results to be imprinted and this methylation block the binding of CTCF. The absence of CTCF allows DNA methylation to spread to H19 promoter and in this way encancer can activate Igf2. On the other hand, maternal allele is demethylated and enhancers are not able to activate Igf2.</span></span></span></p>
<p lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In Wilm's tumor, Igf2 results to be overexpressed due to the hypermethylation of the ICR. In this case Igf2 duplicates its concentration since both maternal and parental alleles block the binding of CTCF and the enhancers activate Igf2 expression. IGF2 gene is a member of the insulin family of polypeptide growth factors, which are envolved in development and growth, therefore its overexpression cause overgrowth.</span></span></span></p>
