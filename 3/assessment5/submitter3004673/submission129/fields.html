    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is that it is generally hypomethylated; and genome wide, repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even introns are generally methylated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, global methylation of DNA is reduced while the some specific CpG island methylation is increased (more dense) in metastatic tissue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease is that in general, these specific now methylated CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Due to these methylations, the tumor suppressor genes are not expressed, and are “hits” that slowly leads to the progression of the disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned, normally DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. Normal function serves as stability to these regions and prevents unwanted recombinations/deletions/insertions/alterations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer, these regions are now generally hypomethylated. Without the methylation, these regions of repeats can align themselves with another region (since they are non-specific common repeats, and now less densely packaged) and unwanted recombination, insertions and deletions can occur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hence, these less densely packaged regions which are normally supposed to be densely packaged and stable are now causing genomic instability, and are again “hits” leading up to the disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common feature of cancer cells is the displayed loss of imprinting. What is supposed to be an imprinting pattern for an allele is changed to the pattern of its partner allele.  Such is the case with cancer that arises from the H19/lgf2 cluster due to loss of imprinting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The methylation pattern of the paternal allele is such that the imprint control region is methylated. Because of this methylation, an insulator element called CTCF cannot bind to it, which supposedly blocks enhancer elements. The enhancer elements (found downstream) are able to act upstream to Igf2, thus allowing its transcription. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated. Due to this, CTCF binds to it, thus shielding the Igf2 from the enhancers. The enhancers will now act on H19 while Igf2 remains silent. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, what should normally be an unmethylated imprint control region in the maternal allele is now methylated, making its profile like that of the paternal allele. Therefore, the supposedly maternal allele now expresses Igf2 like the paternal allele. Since Igf2 is a growth promoter, and now both alleles are expressing it, there is a double dose of expression, contributing to the disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The class of epigenetic inhibitors Decitabine belongs to is DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. When the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) comes along to transfer the metylation marks of parent strand to daughter strand, it encounters the incorporated drug, the DNMT is bound irreversibly to the drug and cannot do its job, leading to the daughter cells with less methylation marks. This drug then, is dependent on cell replication to work, and subsequent divisions will produce cells that have less DNA methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect since one of the hallmarks of cancer cells is its uncontrolled replication vs normal cells. Therefore, the cells that replicate more will be affected more (the cancer cells). Although the mechanism of action is not entirely known yet, a theory is that it affects CpG island hypermethylation as one of its possible specific mechanisms against tumor cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as these epigenetic marks can and are somatically inherited and even transgenerationally inherited. There are mechanisms that remember the methylation profile of the epigenome, and the alteration of which would produce lasting effects. In light of this, this is how drugs that alter DNA methylation are able to maintain effects even after treatment.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period as defined in epigenetics, is a period in the development of the organism where epigenetic reprogramming occurs (the most). It is characterized by having a general lowering of epigenetic marks of the genome in lieu of development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examples of sensitive periods in development:</p>
<p>Early development.</p>
<p>Development of primordial germ cells. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because they can cause “erosions” in the epigenetic profiles, as well as disruption in the resetting of these epigenetic profiles. The implications of these are that the subsequent development of these treated cells will be skewed and could lead to unwanted effects leading to other diseases.  An example of this are how assisted reproductive technologies work in these sensitive epigenetic time periods and statistically, there is an increased rate of diseases that occur in these offspring.</p></div>
