    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal CpG islands are hypomethylated. CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in a cancerous than in a normal cell. CpG island methylation increases as a cancer progresses from a hyperplasia to a neoplasia and finally to a metastasizing invasion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are located in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. They experience hypermethylation in cancer cells. Methylation is associated with gene silencing, and therefore, the tumor suppressor gene will be silenced and the cell will lose a defense against cancer. The cells without a restraint on their growth (the restraint being an active tumor suppressor gene) will proliferate and acquire more mutations, becoming cancerous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repetitive elements and IGRs are hypermethylated in normal cells. Repetitive elements and IGRs are hypomethylated in cancerous cells. Hypomethylation progresses with time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The outcome of hypomethylation in these areas differs depending on where in the genome it is found. In general, this genome-wide hypomethylation, particularly at the repetitive elements, destabilizes the genome. This destabilization and the open state of the chromatin (euchromatin) cause chromosomal recombinations that should not occur (i.e. the recombinations are mutations that will further the cell’s status as cancerous).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is methylated on the maternal allele (maternally imprinted) and is silenced. H19 is expressed from the maternal allele. The insulator protein CTCF will bind to the imprint control region (ICR) on the maternal chromosome when that ICR is unmethylated. That binding allows the downstream enhancers to work on H19.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 is unmethylated on the paternal allele and is expressed. H19 is paternally imprinted and is silenced on the paternal allele due to heterochromatin spreading. Since the ICR is methylated CTCF cannot bind, so the downstream enhancers work on Igf2.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The maternal allele can experience a loss of imprinting at Igf2 by losing its methylation. That means that the two alleles inherited by the offspring will effectively act as active paternal alleles, and overexpression of Igf2 will result.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene, meaning that it promotes growth. Wilm's tumor is associated with overexpression of Igf2. At the same time, there will be no cdkn1c expression. Cdkn1c is a tumor suppressor. The combination of increasing expression of a growth promoter and decreasing expression of a tumor suppressor contributes to the rapid, uninhibited growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) methylates CpG islands. Decitabine inhibits DNMT. As a nucleoside analog, Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA during replication. When the DNMT attempts to bind the nucleotide (where Decitabine has slyly slipped into the genome), and to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, the DNMT is bound irreversibly so it can no longer function. This leads to passive demethylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since DNMT methylates CpG islands, which in normal cells are hypomethylated but in cancerous cells are hypermethylated, Decitabine can reverse the hypermethylation during DNA replication. This should return the cell to a more normal state because it will reactivate tumor suppressor genes. This mechanism of action is particularly suited to cancer because its effects occur during replication, and cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells. Decitabine has been shown to have a positive effect in myelodysplastic syndromes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable; that is, it is passed on to daughter cells during DNA replication and cell division. This is due to the action of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). Therefore, the effects of hyper- or hypomethylation on the parent cell will also afflict the daughter cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time when the cell has little DNA methylation because the epigenetic marks are being reset. This introduces the possibility of the environment as an influence on epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two phases of epigenetic reprogramming: during preimplantation development, and during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some epigenetic drugs are known to act on the whole genome, not just cancer cells. That means that the germ cells in which epigenetic marks are being laid down during the sensitive periods would be susceptible to the effects of the epigenetic drugs. Altered methylation or acetylation in germ cells would be passed on mitotically to all daughter cells.</p></div>
