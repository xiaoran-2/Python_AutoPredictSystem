cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer,genome wide are less methylated than a normal cell but CpG islands like to be more methylated.</p>
<p>CpG island are clusters of CpG dinucleotipe and tend to be in the promotor of genes. Normaly are hypomethylated but can be methylated and in this case the gene is silend. In a cancer cell more CpG islands like to be methylated this maybe cause silencing of tumor supresor genes who inhits the cell division and their silencing  cause overgrow origin a tumor. Which CpG islands are methylated differs by tumor type.</p>
<p>The repetitive elements are secuences  who have multiple copys in the genome and in general have the ability of transposition, this is can move into others sites of the DNA like a copy and paste or cut and paste. And this abitity I have mention is potencionaly mutagenic becose they can paste into other funtional and estructural gene and disrup them or rate his transcription. Thus this repetitive elements are methylated to prevent that or interference of his promoters which promoters of funcional genes or recombination between non homologos chromosomes in similars repetitive elements. In cancer the repetitive elements are hypomethylated thus all the points who I have mention just before can happen and that incresed the genomic instability in general in the genome.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions are usually methylated and the funtion of that is mantein genomic stability too. In cancer cell are hypomethylated and cause interference between RNA polymerase of two neightbor genes who transcribe on opposite directions becose demethylation can active cryptic promoters who are silents in a normal cell. Also active cryptic splice sites who are normaly silent and could cause problems if are recognise for the splicing machinary. And this cause the generally genomic instability which we see in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat myelodysplactic syndrome (who evolve into acute myelogenous leukaemia) . It act as a nucleoside analog and bind to DNMT1, the enzime who mantein methil marks in replication. Thus it effect depend of the replication, cancer cells will be more affected becose they divides more than a normal cell . Is a demethylating agent so belongs to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.Myelodysplactic syndrome is depending of CpG island hypermehylation so a demethylation effect can have an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering methyl groups in the DNA can have a enduring effect becose this methyl marks are mitotically inheherence .Thus past this information of the original cells into her dauhters.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time in which epigenetic marks are more susceptible to the enviroment becose are preriods of epigenetic reprograming . One sensitive period is during pre implantation of the embrio (early development) and other is in development of germ cells.</p>
<p>Treating patiens during sensite periods would be inadvisable becose changes in the epigenome could alther more normal cell not only cancer cell and this changes should be mantein throght the life on the person who should be very young and affet his quality of life.Is for this reason what the target pacients for epigenetic treating are old person.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 Igf2 cluster is father imprinting. In the mathernal allele enhancers cant active Igf becose  the imprint control region are unmethylated and a protein called CTCF  bind to it and insulate the  Igf2 locus so the enhancers are free to active H19. In patternal allelo ICR are methylated thus CTCF cannot bind to it, and the enhancers active Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm s tumour the two alleles have the same expression. ICR are methylated so CTCF do not bind and the enhancers active Igf2 just like paternal alleles. This cause Igf2 overexpression and Igf2 is a grow promotor gene who contribute to this uncontrolled grow we see in a tumor.</p></div>
