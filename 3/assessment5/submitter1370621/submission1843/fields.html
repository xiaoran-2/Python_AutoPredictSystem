    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     </span>The C5 position modification of cytosine (5 mC) is found in approximately 70–80% of <span style="color:#000000;">CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells in addition to some cases in non-CpG sequences in embryonic stem cells.  In general terms, DNA methylation of promoter regions is inversely correlated to gene expression, although exceptions to this general rule are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of the promoter regions of genes.  Gene promoters are characterized by high CpG densities which are usually kept free of methylation in an independent fashion to their activity state.  Nonetheless, promoter CpG islands of cancer cells tend to become hypermethylated (over-methylated), which in turn causes the silencing of the respective genes.  On the other hand, intragenic methylation in sequence regions between exons is found at the repetitive elements such as for instance satellite repeats or remnants of retroviral insertions (LINEs and SINEs) which are highly abundant in human DNA and need to be silenced to maintain genome integrity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss of methylation (hypomethylation) compared to a local and regional gain of DNA methylation (hypermethylation).  The hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands of genes results in genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, while conversely in the silencing of determined tumor suppressor genes which control the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites has been termed CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype).  During cancer progression tumors seem to accumulate higher levels of DNA methylation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     Yet another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer types are the so called CpG island shores, which are defined by approximately 2 kb upstream and downstream regions surrounding CpG islands which are hypermethylated.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     Considering the H19/Igf2 cluster with regard to the hypermethylation of Imprinting Control Regions (ICR) leading to a loss of imprinting, in the paternal cluster the ICR and H19 are methylated disrupting the binding of the CTCF complex to the ICR which results in downstream enhancers expressing the growth promoting Igf2 gene, whereas in the maternal cluster the ICR and H19 are not methylated and the CTCF complex is able to bind to the ICR which prevents the expression of the upstream growth promoting gene Igf2 while that the downstream enhancers promote the expression of the H19 gene.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     In Wilm’s tumor, often seen in pre-neoplastic tissues, the maternal cluster is hypermethylated in the same manner as the paternal complex which therefore leads to a double dose expression of the growth promoting gene Igf2 which results in kidney tumor during early childhood.  </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     Decitabine is on the market under the name of Dacogen and is sold by Eisai (a Japanese company), decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents which are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     <span style="font-size:small;">DNA-demethylating agents <span style="font-size:small;">are compounds that inhibit methylation, resulting in the expression of the previously hypermethylated silenced genes.  These compounds work by binding to the enzymes that catalyse the methylation reaction and which are named DNA methyltransferases.  So most probably suppressor genes of cell cycle and division have been methylated and silenced leading to cancer, the DNA-demethylating agents prevent methylation and bring about the activation of the tumor suppressor genes leading to a cancer therapy.  Once unmethylated the active transcription gene status is passed down mitotically to the daughter cells resulting in a cure to cancer.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (a DNA-demethylating agent) slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer, in those that showed no response to the initial trial they then went on to show an unexpectedly good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were employed on them next.  As histone-acetylation activates gene transcription and histone -deacetylase inhibitors maintain histone-acetylation and gene activation, together with a DNA-demethylating agent which also promotes gene activation and transcription, therefore tumor suppressor genes that had been turned off (down-regulated) were reactivated (transcribed) which together with the standard chemotherapy which kills actively dividing cells resulted in a cure for the cancer types.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;"><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:small;">     Epigenetic agents such as histone-deacetylase inhibitors or DNA-demethylating agents once activating an induced epigenetic state it is passed down to daughter cells by mitotic division resulting in enduring effects on the epigenome.  Nonetheless, during the sensitive periods of the epigenome reprogramming which comprise <span style="font-size:small;">pre-implantation embryos and germline development in males and females, drug administration of epigenetic agents would cause epigenetic mutations and aberrations leading to an incorrect cell differentiation and tissue and organ development.</span></span><br /></span></p></div>
