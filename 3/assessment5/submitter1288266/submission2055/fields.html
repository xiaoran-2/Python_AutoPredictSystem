    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is responsible for different epigenetic phenomena. Promoters of genes which need to be silenced are hypermethylated in normal cells. Hence methylation of the promoter is inversely related to the activity of the gene. However, CpG islands which make up 60% of these regions are free of methylation irrespective of the gene state of activity. In normal cells, DNA methylation is found in repetitive elements and in other intragenic spaces to silence their effect. Methylation of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs leads to good genomic stability.</p>
<p>However in cancer cells, significant changes are seen in the methylation pattern. Hypermethylation of CpG islands especially in promoter regions or CpG island shores of genes has been observed in cancer cells. This leads to the silencing of the respective genes. Such a silencing can occur on a tumor suppressor gene which can be one of the hits in the Knudsen hypothesis. Similarly a hypomethylation of an oncogene promoter can lead to overexpression of the same. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the epimutation can spread rapidly especially if the affected gene is a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene giving the affected cell a better survival rate over the others. Similarly any alterations in the methylation at ICRs can result in over or underexpression of growth promoting or restricting genes respectively. Hypomethylation of intragenic regions is also found in cancer cells leading to genomic instability. This can lead to the activation of repeats and addition and relocation of repeats to the genome sequence. The activaiton of cryptic promoters in such regions can lead to transcription of RNA from wrong location and can lead to disruption of other genes in cis. Hypomethylated repeats can also illegally combine during mitosis leading to major changes in the chromosomes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to the methylation pattern of Imprinting control regions can result in serious problems. The H19/lgf2 cluster is an example of an imprinted gene. The maternal allele has hypomethylation of the H19 promoter and the insulator element upstream of the H19 gene. Hence the CTCF binds to the insulator element and this prevents the enhancer downstream of Igf2 from activating it. Instead the enhancer acts on H19. However the paternal allele has hypermethylation of the H19 promoter and the insulating element. This frees the enhancers to act on Igf2 and hence promotes the growth of the fetus. </p>
<p>Disruption to the methylation pattern ca lead to serious problems as seen in Wilm's tumour. Here, hypermethylation of the ICR is found in both the alleles indicating that the disruption has occurred on the maternal allele. Such a hypermethylation leads to over-expression of the Igf2 gene which is a growth promoting gene. This leads to abnormal growth of the cells and eventually results in tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylasing or DNA-hypomethylasing agent and can be effectively used to treat patients with cancer where the underlying cause of the cancer is the hypermethylation of tumour suppressor or similar genes. Currently it is used in the treatment of <span>myelodysplastic syndromes</span>. </span></p>
<p>Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes can lead to proliferation of cells in an uncontrolled manner. Decitabine can be incorporated into the DNA strands and it hypomethylates the DNA by inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferases. Such DNMT inhibtion results in the non transference of methylation from the parent to the daughter cells during mitosis and indirectly results in hypomethylation of the affected regions. In cases of cancer cells, this leads to the hypomethylation and hence activation of tumour suppressor genes which can act directly on the oncogenes and reduce their effect. This in turns leads to reduced proliferation of the tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. In cancer cells, the action of demethylating drugs on tumour suppressor genes can lead to reactivation of such genes. During mitosis, when methylation is transfered using DNMT, the regions which are demthylated due to the action of the drugs retain the hypomethylation even in the absence of the drug. As a result we see effects of teh drug well beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>However treating patients with such drugs should be avoided during the sensitive periods of epigenetiic reprogramming. One of two such periods is during early development when most of the methylation to the DNA is removed to create the pluoripotent stem cells which are reprogrammed leading to differentiation of cells. Similar removal and appropriate reprogramming also takes place in the other sensitive period involving the development of primordial germ cells. However imprinted genes do not undergo this process. Administration of these drugs during these sensitive periods can lead to the development of wrong methylation pattern. During early development, wrong methylation can affect differentiation of cells and the overall development. Primordial germ cells can also be affected through wrong methylation of ICRs and wrong imprinting of genes which can affect the next generation.</p></div>
