    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated while repetitive elements, the intergenic region and introns are methylated.  In cancer cells the opposite situation is likely to occur with hypermethylation of the CpG island and hypomethylation of the repetitive elements, intergenic region and introns.  The effect of these changes to the epigenetic marking of the CpG islands is to silence tumour suppressor genes and so allow the tumour to grow.  It is thought that the reason for the methylation of the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions is to maintain genomic stability.  That being the case, demethylation of the repetitive elements and the intergenic regions would increase genomic instability, something that occurs with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal and maternal alleles express differently in normal cells.  The maternal allele has  a hypomethylated ICR (Imprint Control Region) with enhancers encouraging the expression of H19, expression of Igf2 is silenced.  The ICR in the paternal allele is hypermethylated, expression of H19 is silenced and the enhancers encourage the expression of Igf2.  In Wilm’s tumour the imprinting of the maternal allele has become disrupted.  The paternal allele continues to function as described above; but the ICR on the maternal allele becomes hypermethylated, this silences the expression of H19 and instead the enhancers encourage the expression of Igf2.  With both the maternal and paternal alleles expressing Igf2 there is over-expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19.  This increases the growth rate of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  The exact mechanism  of action is not known, but it has the effect of irreversibly binding DNMTs so that they are unable to hypermethylate tumour suppressor genes.  If the tumour suppressor genes are not methylated they can continue to express themselves.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin speculates in The Economist article that “epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.”  As long as the marks created by epigenetic  drugs are mitotically inheritable then they would be expected to persist in the progeny of the treated cells, and so result in a slowing of growth and replication of the treated tumour cells.  It is unlikely that the all the tumour cells will be affected by the epigenetic drugs, so there will a proportion of the tumour that have not been treated and they will continue to grow and reproduce aggressively.  These latter cells will be the most susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>At some stages of the development of the host there are sensitive periods when cells are being epigenetically re-programmed, such as germ cell development and early embryonic development.  During these sensitive periods it would be inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs because it could result in currently unpredictable epigenetic marking with could add to genomic instability.</p>
