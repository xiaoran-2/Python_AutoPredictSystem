    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a modification of the C5 position of the cytosine base in CpG dinucleotides. Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions is associated with decrease in gene´s expression.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are also methylated - to repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands in promoter regions are hypermethylated, but CpGs inside genes, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of promoter regions can silence tumor supressor genes (examples: RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer). Hypermethylation can spread to neighbouring CpG islands - CpG island shores (2kb in length) and it helps to turns off the expression of that gene. Hypo- or hyper-methylation of ICRs (which usually encodes growth restricted genes) can lead to loss of expression or overexpression of growth promoting genes which results in loss of imprinting and may lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Genome wide hypomethylation of repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability - deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations may occur. This can disrupt neighbouring genes or activate cryptic promoters which leads to disregulation in gene expression and cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On paternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster, imprint control region for H19 is methylated and therefore it is not bound by CTCF insulator and while the expression of H19 is blocked, enhancers can not act on H19 gene, but because insulator is not bound enhancers act on distant Igf2 gene which is expressed on this paternal allele.</p>
<p>On maternal allele, imprint control region is unmethylated and it is bound by CTCF insulator. In this case enhancers will act on H19 gene and Igf2 will be silenced (not expressed) for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumour patients, imprint control region on maternal allele is methylated as well and therefore the growth promoting Igf2 is expressed in double dose.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinted cluster display loss of imprinting because monoallelic parent-of-origin genes expression is disrupted - they become either expressed from both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. So there is present too much or none of imprinted gene product (which is usually involved in growth) and that leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent; or DNMT inhibitor.</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analogue, which irreversibly binds to DNMTs after it is incorporated into DNA during replication. Bound DNMT can not be then released and can not hypermethylate DNA. This drug is replication dependent and acts better in cancer cells because cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells.</p>
<p>It is used to treat myelodisplastic syndrome, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aleration in DNA methylation can have enduring effect on epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive period - regarding epigenetics, is during early development (prenatal period) when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. Sensitive period is also when development of germ lines take place in ones organism.</p>
<p>Treating younger patients with epigenetic altering drugs is inadvisable, because these drugs influence every cell in organism and can alter processes which happens in developing germ cells. Disruption of processes of epigenetic machinery in these cells may have bad consequences.</p>
