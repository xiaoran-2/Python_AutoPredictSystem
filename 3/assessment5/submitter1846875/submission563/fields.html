    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be unmethylated. Methylation at CpG island silences gene expression, because CpG islands are often find at promoter of genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. The silencing gene expression is achieved by the methylated CpG binding proteins, MeCP1&amp;2, that create a repressive chromatine structure. A second mechanism may be achieved because methylated CpG islands can prohibit transcrition factor binding, and alter gene expression. In cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated silencing tumour suppressor genes. This DNA methylation alterations increase with time. Recently has been found that this methylation also extends to the shores of CGIs. Hypermethylates CGIs varies by tumour type. The contribute of this alterations are explained by the Knudson hypothesis that says that cancer is the result of mutiple hits to DNA and DNA methylation may be one of them. This epimutations are rapidly selected since they give an advantage to the cell. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated with the function of maintaining genomic integrity. In repetitive elements, the genome defense model says that since DNA methylation is mutagenic, it can protect the genome from transposable elements. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, and it becomes more frequent as the person ages. The consequences of the genomic instability obtained in cancer are illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. This alterations lead to an abnormal karyotype</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/ Igf2 cluster is paternaly imprinted. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated which does not let the CTCF protein bind to the ICR. When the CTCF is not present the enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it. Also in the paternal allele, the H19 gene is not expressed because the methylation from the ICR spreads to the H19 gene silencing it. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated thus CTCF can bind. When the CTCF is binding, it does not let the enhancers reach Igf2 gene, making them activate instead the H19 gene which is not methylated. In Wilm's tumour ICR methylated in oth alleles. Since the CTCF protein is not binding anymore, this will allow the activation of Igf2 gene. In Wilm's tumour is found overexpression of the Igf2 gene that is an oncogene, this the alteration will promote growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a epigenetic inhibitor which belongs to the DNA Mehtyl Tranferases Inhibitors class. These drugs are nucleoside analogues and are also dependent of the replication of the cell, which makes the cancer cells more susceptible . The drug gets inpregnated in the DNA upon DNA replication and will bind to DNMT1 irreversibly. This action will not allow the methylation of the daughter strand. In a lower dose this drug causes DNA demethylation, which can have a anti-tumour effect when a cancer is caused by hypermethylation of the CpG islands, as is the case of Myelodysplastic Syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>A drug that alters DNA methylation can have a effect that last beyond the period of drug treatment, because this epigenetic alteration is mitotically heritable. Therefore epigenetics changes are passed on during cell division until they are actively erased. Hoewever once they are erased they will not return. </span>A sensitive period corresponds to a period in which the altered  environments can influence epigenetic control. The period of primordial germ cell development is one of the sensitive periods and it goes until the mature eggs and sperm. The second sensitive period corresponds to the pre implatation and early post implatation period. Both of this periods are active moments of remodeling of the epigenome. There can also be other brief periods more sensitive for certain organs, however not so sensitive as the two major periods mentioned before, those other periods depend on specific tissue differentiation of an organ. In contrast the somatic maintenance periods are less sensitive, in most of our lives. Therefore it would be inadvisable to use these drugs that alter the DNA methylation in a sensitive period of epigenetic reprograming because it would possibly lead to a disease state due the dramatic change in epigenetic code.</p></div>
