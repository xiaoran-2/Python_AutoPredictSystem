    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the enzymatic methylation of cytosine bases. Such modification at promoter regions generally speaking is negatively correlated with gene expression. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation and methylation at CpG island equals to silencing of gene expression because it is associated with the fromation of repressive chromatin structure and it may prohibit the binding of transcription factors. In cancer cells, often times, CpG islands are hypermethylated. This is frequently found at the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. Inhibition of promoter function via hypermethylation would lead to repression of downstream genes. The decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes lead to oncogenesis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, DNA is normally methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome, such as in satellite repeats, LINEs and SINEs. This is protective since the methylation prevents  chromosome insertion, deletion, translocation, transposition or recombination from happening, maintaining genome integrity. In cancer, there is the so-called genome-wide hypomethylation, i.e. the decrease of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. DNA hypomethylation at these sites often causes genetic instability, oncogenic mutations happen.</p>
<p>In summary, the change of DNA methylation status in cancer includes a genome-wide loss and a focal gain of such modification. They may all impact the expression of disease specific genes, such as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes one way or another and contribute to the onset and process of these diseases.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, also called Dacogen or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, similar to azacitidine, is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside. They both belong to DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and so decreases the methylation of DNA. This mechanism of action is similar to that of azacitidine, but decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. Decitabine has been successfully used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Multiple genes in MDS have been found to be hypermethylated, which includes p15INK4B, a cell-cycle inhibitor gene. Methylation of p15INK4B is correlated with blastic bone marrow involvement in MDS and it increases during disease progression to AML. Decitabine reverses the hypermethylation status of p15INK4B, allowing for normal p15INK4B protein expression. Hypomethylation of p15INK4B has aslo been associated with hematologic response, indicating that pharmacologic demethylation is a possible mechanism for clinical response.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Baylin noticed that in his trial with a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibtior and azacitidine that some patients who didn't show much response to this trial itself but showed an unexpected good reaction to routine chemotherapy which ensued this trial. Altering the DNA methylation in tumor cells may have made them more susceptible to standard therapy. The epigenetic modification is mitotically heritable to next generation of cancer cells.  </p>
<p>While using agents that modify the DNA methylation status, one has to pay attention to some periods in development that are sensitive and avoid treating patients with such drugs. A sensitive period refers to the time that epigenetic marks are being re-programmed. These sensitive periods include pre-implantation period in early development and the period of primordial germ cell development. During these periods, epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency and then re-established. Azacitidine or similar drug application while DNA methylation is being reprogrammed would have deteriorating effects on gametes and embryo. So early pregnant women and whoever expects to be reproductive should be cautious.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Igf2 and H19 coding regions are separated by a differentially methylated region (DMR) that is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. Expression of IGF2 and H19 genes are both regulated by a 3’ distal enhancer. The normal methylation of DMR on paternal allele prevents CTCF insulator protein from binding to the area and so permits the Igf2 promoter activation and mRNA transcription, but not the H19 mRNA. While on maternal allele, the CTCT binds to the unmethylated  DMR, the activation of Igf2 promoter by the distal enhancer is inhibited.</span></p>
<p><span>If the ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster, i.e. the DMR, are methylated on both parental chromosomes,  the loss of imprinting would result in biallelic activation of IGF2  and biallelic silencing of H19. IGF2 is then overexpressed. This continuous proliferative stimulus would eventually lead to tumor formation, such as Wilm’s tumor. IGF2 overexpression and alterations of the H19 DMR were found in two-thirds of the Wilm’s tumors. The best sample of H19/Igf2 imprinting interruption is Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome, which exhibits overexpression of IGF2 and is associated with organomegaly of newborns and high incidence of several pediatric sarcomas, such as rhabdomysarcoma and nephroblastoma. Mechanism may include mutation/deletion, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption.</span></p>
