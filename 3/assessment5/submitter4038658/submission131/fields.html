    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In general, at CpG islands, the normal function of DNA methylation is to hypomethylate CpG islands to ensure that tumor suppressor genes are active.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cell. There is CpG island hypermethylation or CGI hypermethylation.</p>
<p>At CpG islands, disruption of DNA methylation is able to inactivate tumor suppressive genes contributing to the disease. In addition, in the progression of the disease, increased methylation of CpG islands that are associated with tumour suppressors could be observed.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation allows the maintenance of intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are depleted of repetitive elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 is methylated. On the paternal allele, because this is methylated, now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binding to insulate this, and IGF2 is expressed from the pattern allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the imprint control region of the H19/Igf2 is unmethylated. Therefore, CTCF 4 will bind its insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19. In this case, Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is loss of imprinting. As a result, there is a high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the maternal allele, there is also an expression of Igf2. Therefore, there is now a double dose of Igf2 in comparison to the dose of a normal cell.</p>
<p>Igf2 is growth promoter and loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Decitabine is also a nucleoside analog and it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication. Then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind Decitabine too; then to copy the methylation to the daughter strand. The DNA methyltransferase in question is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released.</p>
<p>The action of Decitabine as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent; thus the cell must be replicating. So this means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.  As a result, Decitabine will be acting as an anti-tumour effect because they cause DNA demethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are defined as the time during development when cells are actively dividing and when the person seems to be more vulnerable to influences from his environment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development will be during pre-natal development or during germ cells development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the importance of epigenetic machinery and inhibiting it may lead to bad results.  </p></div>
