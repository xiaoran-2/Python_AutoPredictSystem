    <div class="field-value"><p>The silencing of certain genes at certain times is essential for proper functioning of our bodies. DNA methylation at CpG islands is one of the ways gene silencing is achieved in normal cells. An inactivating epigenetic mark is laid down by DNA methyltransferases and is maintained by DNMT1. An example of normal DNA methylation that takes place at CpG islands is X inactivation where one of the two X chromosomes carried by females is inactivated or silenced.</p>
<p>Errors in the genetic code, aging, diet and environmental factors can all lead to epigenetic mistakes that lead to cancer and other diseases. The disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands causes genes to be hypermethylated. If this over-methylation takes place at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, for example, the result is excessive cell proliferation, or cancer.  Hypermethylation at CpG islands can affect a single gene or entire sets of genes. Examples of single gene hypermethylation  in cancer are BCRA1 in breast cancer and MLH1 in colorectal cancer.  Hypermethylated sets of genes are associated with a number of tumor types, such as colorectal, gliomas, and neuroblastomas, with the particular sets of hypermentylated genes being distinct for each tumor type.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. The primary function of methylation is to maintain genomic integrity by preventing insertions, deletions, and translocation. When a portion of a gene that is not needed for its current purpose is methylated, it’s silenced resulting in the chromatin becoming compacted so it’s much less likely for recombination to occur. When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypormethylated (less methylation) there is a far greater likelihood for deletions, insertions and translocations to take place which can result in cancer and other diseases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>For the paternal allele methylation at the imprint control region prevents the protein CTCF from binding. This allows Igf2 to be expressed and silences H19.The maternal allele unmethylated so CTCF binds, blocking the Igf2 enhancer and expressing H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor there is an upregulation of Igf2 which can be caused by mutations of insertions or deletions causing a loss of imprinting in one of the parental alleles,  uniparental disomy, or epigenetic disruptions to methylation of the alleles.  Any one of these mutations will result in an error in imprinting and therefore erroneous expression of H19/Ifg2.</p>
<p>When the imprint control region (ICR) for H19, is <strong>unmethylated</strong>  the ICR is bound by the protein CTCF. This acts as an insulator preventing the downstream enhancer of Igf2 from acting on Igf2. This “enhancer blocking” results in “chromatin looping” and in the expression of H19 instead of Igf2. When ICR is <strong>methylated</strong> CTCF is not bound and the enhancer is free to promote the expression of Igf2. When imprinting happens correctly there is balanced expression of the genes, where there is an imprinting error too much or too little of either can be produced causing disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an DNA-demethylating agent used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrom. As a DNA-demethlating agent, it acts to inhibit DNA methyltransferase. The epigenetic changes caused in cells by decitabine are beleived to be passed on during cell division to daughter cells. Once eventually erased, they don't return. This mechonism of action, or anit-tumor effect, is in stark contrast to traditional chemotherapies becuase it's not killing the cells. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By inducing epigenetic changes in the cells, these changes are believed to be passed on during cell division to daughter cells and then to granddaughter cells, eventually being erased all together. So the cells are actually changing their genomic expression, which is a durable change even once the drug is no longer being administered.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when genes are susceptible to epigenetic control. The most significant epigenetic reprogramming happens during early development and primordial germ cell development. Though there are also particular sensitive periods during organ development based on how an organ develops.</p>
<p>The risk with treating patients during sensitive periods is that the drug might have a greater potential to effect normal cells in addition to cancer cells, which could ultimately cause more problems than the treatment solves. </p></div>
