    <h1>Submission 611 from Anon (session_user_id: d9ca7ca27401339a0294dc39b93e98e2e3ec6d04)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs belongs to the class of hypomethylating medications. As can be derive from the class name these types of drugs will lower the overall methylation state of the genomic DNA. More specifically, 2’-deoxy-5-5azacytidine or decitabine is a cytosine analogue. This prodrugs is activated via deoxycytidine kinase to obtain a deoxyribonucleoside structure that  can now become a substrate for the DNA replication enzymes. During DNA replications these drugs will be incorporated as a substitute for the normal cytosine. Because of the nitrogen group incorporated in these molecules DNA-methyl-transferases can recognize these nucleotides but the methylation reaction can not be completed  successfully. Over time this results in an overall drop of the DNA-methylation level. This may reactivate previously silenced tumor repressor genes and may make the tumor more vulnerable to routine chemotherapeutic treatments.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contains, in the following order, the Igf2 gene, an imprint control region, the H19 gene and a couple of enhancer regions. The allele inherited by your mother has an unmethylated ICR which is recognized by a CTCF insulator protein. Because of this the enhancers can only influence H19, leaving Igf2 unexpressed. The paternal allele on the other hand has a methylated ICR and a methylated H19 promoter, making it impossible for CTCF to bind the ICR. Thereby the enhancers will now influence Igf2, leaving H19 unexpressed. If by some aberration in the methylation machinery the maternal allele converts to a paternal imprinting pattern, H19 will not be expressed and Igf2 will be overexpressed. This will cause a dramatic increase in cell growth leading to Wilm’s tumour. Another possible defect at this locus is paternal uniparental disomy. Meaning that the patiënts has inherited two parentally methylated copies of the gene causing Beckwith-Wiedermann syndrome which is characterized by an increased risk of cancer during childhood. When the reverse happens, two maternally imprinted genes, giving no Igf2 expressing, this will result in Silver-Russell dwarfism, another growth disorder.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands, which are often found at promoters of genes, tend to be unmethylated. The small subset which is methylated induces silencing of particular genes during differentiation to a certain cell type. In a lot of cancer samples however there is an overall DNA hypermethylation op the CpG islands and CpG island shores. This may be an alternative method of the tumour to silence tumour suppressor genes, such as RB, MLH and BRCA1, during cancer development and one of the first hits in the Knudson hypothesis. Next to CpG hypermethylation, cancers are also characterized by an genome wide hypomethylation. In normal cells repeats and intergenic regions display a silencing methylation pattern to accomplish genomic stability. When this pattern disappears during cancer development this stability is lost. This quit often leads to illegitimate recombination, activation of repeat, cryptic promoters and disruption of several genes. All of these rearrangements of the genome will, by selective pressure, result in the deactivation of tumour suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since in almost every cancer type we see an overall genome wide hypomethylation and a CpG island hypermethylation, this represents a big opportunity for the development of cancer therapeutics. Specifically the targeting of enzymatic epigenetic regulators since there are the most accessible targets for small molecular compounds. One approved example of such a drug is the DNMT inhibitor Decitabine. This cytosine analogue will, after incorporation in the genome, irreversible bind with DNMT, thereby preventing it from methylating any DNA regions after replications. This will eventually undo the DNA hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, often found in cancers. Because of the systemic use and effect of these kinds of drugs, cautions is advised when administering it to patients during sensitive periods in their life. More specifically, one needs to consider the  possible side effects on kids whom are still developing there germ cells, which undergo a large amount of epigenetic reprogramming, and are thereby extremely sensitive to drugs which intervene with the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
