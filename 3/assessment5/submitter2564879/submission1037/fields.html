    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands <span>are found in about 60% of gene promoters and are </span>typically unmethylated. DNA methylation in promotor CpG islands - or within a region of 2kb around islands, called "shores" - usually causes silencing of the associated gene. This is presumably done by physically obstructing transcription factors from binding to the promoter, or by binding methyl-binding domain (MDB) proteins, which<span> in turn can recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone deacetylation would then inhibit gene expression by causing condensation into an inactive (hetero)chromatin state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In cancer cells,</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> however, CpG islands and shores are often found hypermethylated. CpG methylation typically increases during cancer progression and <span>is statistically associated with </span><span>metastasis and poor prognosis</span>. One mechanism by which hypermethylation could lead to cancer is the aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes (such as RB, MHL1 or BRCA1), which could represent one of the "hits" of the Knudson "two hit" model of carcinogensis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">On the contrary, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermethylated in healthy cells. In these cases, DNA methylation can prevent illigetimate recombination of chromosomes that have stretches of similar sequence repeats, but are not homologous. Furthermore, hypermethylation can suppresses unwanted transcription from cryptic promoters within genes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer cells, although CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, the genome is globally hypomethylated; this phenomenom also increases with time and disease progression. Hypomethylation of repetitive elements and transposons can cause g</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">enomic instability - illegitimate recombination (especially of pericentrimeric repeats) and transposon "jumping" around in the genome can cause genes to be deleted or DNA pieces inserted into and interrupting other genes, or can result in deleterious fusion gene products (such as the constitutively active chimeric kinase Bcr-Abl by fusion of chromosomes 9 and 22). Finally, hypomethylation could uncover cryptic promoters and aberrantly activate gene transcripts.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Ifg2 cluster is methylated, which keeps the insulator protein CTCF (<span>CCCTC-binding </span><span>factor</span>) from binding and prevents distal enhancers to induce transcription of the lncRNA H19. Instead, the distal enhancers increase expression of Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2).</p>
<p>On the maternal allele - the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind the insulator element, causing the distal enhancers to increase expression of H19, which in turn silences Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting causes hypermethylation of the ICR on the paternal allele. In this case, CTCF cannot bind the insulator region, causing enhancers to upregulate Igf2 instead of H19 - resulting in a doubled gene dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>In this situation, more Igf2 means that more can bind to the Igf1-receptor, resulting in more activation of <span>PI3-kinase and Akt which both ultimately promote growth and cell division</span>. It is suspected that an abundance of growth promoting factors are a hallmark of preneoplastic tissues, and facilitate the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent. It works by acting as a c<span>ytidine deoxynucleoside analogue, meaning that it can be incorporated into the DNA during replication, and blocks the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) - effectively reducing DNA methylation in a replication-depending manner.</span></span></p>
<p>Although the exact specific mechanism is still unclear, several mechanisms are proposed: Cancer cells, which divide much faster than normal healthy cells could be generally more affected by replication-dependent demethylation. In pre-cancerous blood disorders (eg. myelodysplastic syndrome), CpG hypermethylation and tumor suppressor gene silencing has been found, which could be reversed by DNA demethylating agents such as Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changing DNA methylation can have lasting effects in two layers. Methylation by itself is usually maintained (by DNMT1) throughout replication - changes will be mitotically inherited to daughter cells. Secondly, DNA methylation often recruits chromatin remodeling enzymes to lay down a second layer of epigenetic marks and lock in the activation state further to have an enduring effect.</p>
<p>During "sensitive periods", epigenetic marks are actively removed and newly established in a specific way, and <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">environmental factors can </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">have an effect on this process. During development, these periods include time between preimplantation and post-implantation, as well as the primordial germ cell development to the development of mature gametes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these sensitive periods (esp. young patients, pregnant females) is inadvisable, since they could interfere with normal epigenetic reprogramming and could result in imprinting defects/disorders (eg. Beckwith-wiedermann syndrome</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">).</span></p></div>
