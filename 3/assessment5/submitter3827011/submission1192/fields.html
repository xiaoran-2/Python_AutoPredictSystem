    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are genomic regions with a high frequency of CpG sites and most often occur in and around the promoter regions of genes. In non-cancerous, 'normal' cells, these islands are usually unmethylated. In cancerous cells, the CpG islands are found to be hypermethylated. In specific forms of cancer, such as types of colorectal cancer, the CpG islands of specific sets of genes are hypermethylated and this has been termed CpG island methylator phenotype, or CIMP. The actual CpG islands that are hypermethylated have been found to differ by tumour type. Interestingly, hypermethylation of the CpG islands is often found to spread to the neighbouring 2kb of DNA, the so-called CpG island shores.</p>
<p>Methylation of the promoters genes causes gene silencing. CpG island methylation occurs in the promoter regions of tumour suppressor genes. Silencing of tumour suppressor genes results in an uncontrolled cell cycle and DNA repair and thus tumorigenesis. </p>
<p>By contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells while in cancerous cells, these are hypomethylated.The methylation of these regions and elements contributes to genomic stability and as a consequence, the decrease in methylation increases the instability of the genome. </p>
<p>Consequences of this hypomethylation vary by location however can be characterised by illegitimate recombination at repeats, activation of repeats and their transposition, resulting in activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of genes. These activities result in deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocation of genomic material and thereby mutations associated with cancers and other diseases.</p>
<p>As a cancer progresses, normal genomic methylation decreases as there is an increase in the hypermethylation of the CpG islands. Thus the genome progressively becomes more unstable as there is a decrease in cell cycle control and DNA repair.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinted is the monoallelic gene expression of either the maternal or paternal allelle. Gene expression is controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs) which are differentially methylated. ICRs are found in clusters on chromosomes. </p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is one example of genomic imprinting. This cluster on chromosome 11, is methylated at the ICR on the paternal chromosome and unmethylated at the ICR on the maternal chromosome. In a 'normal' cell, CTCF, an insulator protein, and its cofactors bind to the ICR on the maternal chromosome. This allows enhancers downstream of the ICR to activate the H19 promoter. The paternal ICR is methylated, so there is no site for CTCF to bind and methylation spreads to silence the H19 promoter. This allows the enhancers to activate the Igf2 promoter upstream of the ICR.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation is found at the H19/Igf2 ICR and thus the maternal and paternal ICR are methylated. As such, the maternal allele acts as the paternal allele and there is resultant overexpression of the Igf2 gene as the Igf2 gene is expressed by both alleles. Igf2 is a growth promoter and its overexpression results in unregulated cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitibine is incorporated into DNA as an analog of cytosine during replication and then irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase thereby decreasing the availability of DNA methyltransferase in the nucleus. Thus, decitabine inhibits hypermethylation.</p>
<p>If used in the correct dosage range, decitabine can decrease DNA hypermethylation. This is of particular interest to decrease the DNA hypermethylation, associated with various cancers, at CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Any decrease in this hypermethylation will result in an increase in expression of tumour suppressor genes and thus tumour suppression. Decitabine used at very high dosages is found to be toxic and ineffective against cancer.</p>
<p>The mode of action of decitabine is currently unclear but is is currently being used to inhibit tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation in haematological malignancies and is being trialled for use in many other tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In tumour cells, there is an increase in DNA hypermethylation at the CpG islands and DNA hypomethylation at the intragenic regions and repetitive elements. Hypermethylation at the CpG islands results in suppression of the expression or tumour suppressor genes. Hypomethylation of intragenic regions and repetitive elements results in genomic instability and its resultant genetic mutations.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. That is, the DNA methylation mark is passed from parent to daughter cells during mitosis. These methylation marks may be altered through the use of drugs or diet. The use of a drug that decreases methylation at CpG island will result in a decrease in the methylation at that site in the daughter cells and thus a gradual dilution of the tumorigenic cell type at each mitosis. The reverse would be true if there were a drug to increase methylation at intragenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. These periods occur during early embryonic and primordial germ cell development. Drugs that alter DNA methylation should be avoided during sensitive periods as any disruption to epigenetic reprogramming may result in epigenetic abnormalities such as aberrant imprinting and result in disease or embryo death.</p></div>
