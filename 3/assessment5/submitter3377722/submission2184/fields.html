    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In a normal cell we usually find that the CpG islands are not methylated while the intergenic and repetitive islands are, this makes sure that the cell is functioning in the right fashion, in cancer cells however we find that it's quite the opposite, the CpG islands are methylated while the intergenic and repetitive islands are not and we know that cancer uses both these ways otherwise known as: </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">-Tumor suppressor hypermethylation : works by heavily methylating the CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes thus leaving the DNA unable to suppress tumors.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">-hypomethylation genome wide the hypomethylation of the integenic and repetitive islands which contributes to cancer by activating oncogenes and gain the ability to repeat themselves.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>the H19/Igf2 cluster usually differs between the paternal and maternal allele depending on methylation.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele for example the imprint control region (ICR) is usually methylated which means that the CTCF will not bind and thus giving the enhancers the right to act on Igf2 which will be expressed from the paternal allele, on the maternal allele on the other hand it's quite the opposite as the ICR is not methylated which means the CCTF will bind which will make the enhancers act on the H19 and that means that the Igf2 will not be expressed from the maternal allele and this what we usually find in a normal cel.</p>
<p>In wilm's tumor however we find that the ICRs of both paternal and maternal alleles are hypermethylated, causing the CCTF to not bind and the enhancers to act on the Igf2 in both alleles which will cause the Igf2 to be expressed from both alleles giving the patient a double dose of the Igf2 which is a growth promoter associated with wilm's tumor</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor class (DNMTi) is an FDA approved drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . When this drug is used in low doses it can cause DNA demethylation because it gets incorporated into the DNA and it doesn't allow it to copy the DNA methylation to the daughter strand upon division, moreover when this drug was used in lower doses it was found to have an anti-neoplastic effect, which means that it is killing tumor cells and because it is division dependent it means that cancer cells will be more affected since they tend to replicate at a much more higher rate.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Drugs that alter DNA methylation can and usually do have effects that last way beyond the period of drug treatment and this occurs because these drugs usually bind to the DNA laying new epigenetic marks and because they are mitotically heritable they do get passed on to the daughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">This is particularly alarming if we consider the possibility that the drug might affect all the cells in the systems so we should be aware of the sensitive periods where the epigenetic marks are most affected, after the epigenetic marks are cleared and then reprogrammed.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Treating patients during these sensitive periods -the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development - might have a lasting effect on both the patient or the future generations since the drugs have the ability to reach all cells within the system and thus changing the epigenetic marks on those developing cells. </span></p>
