    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides, it is maintained during cell division as other epigenetic marks, and its function is to silence gene expression because of this epigenetic mark can avoid the interaction of transcription factors and it is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (heterochromatin) through methylated CpG binding proteins which have a transcriptional repression domain and are able to recruit other factors that condense the chromatin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">DNA methylation occurs specially in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements while CpG islands in promotors are protected of this chemical transformation. The main role of methylation in intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity and to silence cryptic transcription start sites. In repetitive elements, this methylation prevent transposition and transcriptional interference form strong promoters, and avoid illegitimate recombination. On the other hand, CpG islands are usually unmethylated in order to keep the expression of genes that could be essential for all the process of the healthy cell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">The pattern of DNA methylation changes in a cancer cell, the global level of methylation tends to decrease as the disease progresses; however, the methylation of CpG islands increase. This event are associated to silence tumor suppressor genes, which control the cell division cycle, such as: RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT. These alteration in DNA methylation has been found in different kind of cancers and they are related to the disease prognosis. In contrast, intergenic regions and repeat elements are hypomethylated and as a result, the genome becomes more unstable, producing deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions causing mutations in the chromosomes that can affect the function of genes that control the progression of the cell cycle. Finally, this hypomethylation has been found in CpG poor promoters and they are associated with the expression of oncogenes, as R-RAS. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;">The H19/Igf2 cluster has the gene Igf2, a imprint control region (ICR), the gene H19 and enhancers. In a healthy cell, the ICR is unmethylated and is bound by an insulator protein (CTCF). This protein does not allow that enhancer can act on the gene Igf2, inhibiting its expression. However, these enhancer can work on the gene H19 increasing its expression. On the other hand, the ICR in the paternal allele is methylated and avoid the interaction with CTCF, this event allows that the enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Furthermore, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence its expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:HelveticaNeue;">Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs are crucial in development of disease because they can cause loss of expression of genes that control growth cell or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In Wilm´s tumour, the  ICR is methylated in the maternal allele and also H19 promoter while it keeps normal in the paternal allele. This causes double dose of Igf2, which have been considered a growth promoting gene associated with cancer progression. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent (DNMTi) and inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferases, enzymes responsible for silencing gene expression. Its chemical structure is quite similar to nucleosides and it can be incorporated into DNA during replication. This molecule binds irreversible DNA methyltransferases blocking their function. Studies have shown that cancer cells are more susceptible to this treatment because these cells divide more times than normal cells. The effect anti-tumor of Decitabine may be related to DNA methyltransferases function. These enzymes catalyze the methylation of specific sequences of DNA, silencing gene expression. In cancer, tumor suppressor genes promoter are highly methylated inhibiting their expression and allowing the progression of the cell division cycle. It is possible to speculate that If these enzymes are blocked by the drug, the silencing expression of tumor suppressor genes could be avoided. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#1d1d1d;">There are two periods during life where epigenetic control play a crucial role in the development of an individual, specially DNA methylation. These periods are known as “sensitive periods” and they occur during pre-implantation (early development) and primordial germ cells development (PGC). During these stages, the pattern of DNA methylation becomes unmethylated, in order to remove somatic epigenetic marks to allow the expression of genes required to establish totipotency status in the zigote or set the particular germ line chromatin and the epigenetic signatures required. However, the epigenetic marks are re-establish during the rest of our lives. In addition, repetitive elements and imprinted genes are resistant to this epigenetic reprograming in the pre-implantation, but they are clearing during PGC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#1d1d1d;">These events display the relevance of these epigenetic marks have in a normal development of an individual. </span><span style="color:#1d1d1d;">Therefore, the use of drugs that interfere with this pattern of methylation could be detrimental. If the DNMTi have enduring effects, they could affect dramatically the embryo growth because it would trigger the disruption of epigenetic reprogramming and probably avoid the embryo development. I consider that patients who plan to have a baby or are pregnant could not take these drugs.  </span></span></p>
