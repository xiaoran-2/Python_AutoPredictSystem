    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control is methylated on the paternal allele. So, because it's methylated, CTCF can't bind to the imprint control by his insulator element. <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Therefore, the enhancers can act on Igf2 and promote his expression.</span></p>
<p>But, on the maternal allele, the imprint control is unmethylated. So, in this case, CTCF is binding and the enhancers will act on H19. And so, Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>However, with disruption of imprinting, like in Wilm's tumor, you'll have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the paternal and maternal allele as well. So, Igf2 is also expressing on the maternal allele, and you have a double dose of Igf2, compared to a normal cell. <span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Because Igf2 promotes cell growth, his overexpression promotes cancer's development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and it's used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It's a nucleosid analog, what is incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly by this inhibitor and the methyltransferase can no longer be released. In other word, the decitabine is division dependent, and because the cancer cells are dividing much more quickly than most other body cells, those cancer cells will be more affected by this DNMTi.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">At CpG islands, the DNA methylation is necessary for some epigenetic phenomena like imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. In a normal cell, the CpG islands are usually unmethylated and don't influence the genes expression. But in contrast, in cancer cells, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. </span>Yet,  CpG islands are the promoter of tumour suppressor genes : so, the hypermethylation of the CpGislands lead to an inactivation of those genes and thereby promote the survival of the cancer cells.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In a normal cell, the DNA methylation's goal in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to preserve the genomic stability assuring that the cell doesn't have illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes or loss/gain of chromosomes. In cancer cells, the intergenic region become hypomethylated. As the cancer moves on, the methylation differences between normal cells and cancer cells become bigger. As results, the hypomethylation in these regions induce illegitimate recombination between repeats like translocations, but also insertions, deletions, or activate genes because they are no longer repressed. This instability of the genome can occasion tumorigenesis.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The epigenom is mitotically heritable, so the alteration of DNA methylation in a cell are<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>passed on to daughter cells during mitosis until they are actively erased.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">A sensitive period is a period when the alteration of the<span class="apple-converted-space"> </span>reprogramming of the epigenome can have heavy longterme consequences. There are two sensitive periods : the first during germ cell development ; the second during early development. During these periods of development, the epigenetic drugs must be avoided. The consequence of altering the epigenome during these periods can alter not only the cancer cells but also all the body cells, including somatic and reproductive cells. That the modifications would be pass to the next generation.</span></p></div>
