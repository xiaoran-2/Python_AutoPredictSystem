    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally not methylated. These islands are called promoted CpGs, and they are involved in the expression of a gene. In normal CpG islands in a normal gene, DNA methylation, if present, functions as a gene silencer by formation of heterochromatin. However, in a cancer call, DNA methylation occurs at promoter CpG islands, at an increased rate This hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands, causes the root gene to be silenced. This hypermethylation can cause tumor-suppresor genes to be silenced, and allow cancerous tumors to grow. This disruption in CpG methylation can also cause mental retardation, such as the Fragile X syndrome, caused by the gene FMR1, as well as Rett syndrome. Cancers that involve hypermethylation of CpG islands don't involve the same islands being hypermethylated in all the different types of cancer. That is to say, the hypermethylated islands differ with each cancer type. There are also panels of biomarkers that use this CpG hypermethylation to diagnose the types of tumors, such as for glioma or neuroblastoma. These panels of biomarkers can also be used to find tumor sub types, and the origin of the primary tumor versus the metastisised ones, for more effective treatment. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal call are methylated, and the CpG islands are unmethylated, that is, there is no DNA methylation taking place at those islands. In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are hypermethylated, and the intergenic regions are repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This "swap" in the methylation on a genome can supress the tumor supressor genes and potentially express the oncogene. This hypomethylation can also lead to genomic instability, which can lead to the illegitimate recombination between repeats, such as translocation Deletions and insertions in a genome can also be a result, leading to cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, meaning that it causes the methylation that normally may take place on a genome to not occur, and consequently express certian genes that may normally be silenced. For example, in cancer, many tumor-suppresor genes are silenced by hypermethylation by those specific genes. Decitabine can cause the hypermethylation of those genes to be reversed, hypomethylating and activating them, potentially reducing the rate of tumor growth, or stopping it completely. It may also be able to activte the tumor supressor genes to the point where the tumors may actually be able to start shrinking, effectively helping cure cancer tumors, increasing the chaces of a good prognosis for patients. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal embryo, the maternal H19 is hypomethylated and expressed, whereas the paternal H19 is hypermethylated and silent. This hypermethylation of H19 corrosponds to the increase in expression of Igf2, and similarly, the hypomethylation of H19 on the maternal allele corrosponds to a decrease in the expression of Igf2. certian experiemtents have shown that H19 expression dictates the expression of Igf2 and the effexts of overexpression of Igf2 is similar to the effect of underexpression of H19. </p>
<p>Overexpression of the H19 gene has been linked to the development of esophagal and colorectal cancer cells. It is also a source of genomic instability in a cancer cell, and can be used to study the ploidty of a cell. Overexpression of Igf2 has been directly linked to Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor. </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, there is no expression of H19 on the maternal allele. The disruption of balance and the consequent increased expression of Igf2 on both alleles contributes to the development of Wilm's tumor. This shows that H19 could possibly act as a tumor supressor, as Igf2 seems to promote tumor growth. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically hertiable process, which can last throughout the lifespan of a cell. Therefore, when DNA methylation occurs, it is copied again and again, from a cell to its daughter cells, and to their daughter cells and so on. Since cancer cells replcate more rapidly, any effect on DNA methylation in a cancer cell is passed on more quickly and can effect the tumor more severely. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods, in which epigenetic markers are more vulnerable, can be during the development of germ cells in children who have cancer, as well as during the pregnancy of a woman who has cancer. The drugs being administered to the patients may adversely effect these germ cells or the fetus, which may lead to infertility, when it is given to a child, or a miscarriage in a pregnant woman. </p></div>
