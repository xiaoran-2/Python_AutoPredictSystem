    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation is a normal process that occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. Normal methylation of the CpG islands in the promoter of a gene as well as in the shores results in its normal expression</li>
<li>Studies showed that hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of a target gene can decrease the expression of this gene or silence its expression. For example, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT genes are examples of genes whose CpG islands hypermethylation correlated with different types of cancer. Moreover, the hypermethylation of CpG island shores that are located about 2Kb upstream or downstream of the CpG islands could also contribute to cancer.</li>
<li>As mentioned previously, methylation is a normal physiological process that is critical for cell survival. However, external factors could trigger changes in the methylation pattern of specific genes such as causing abnormal methylation (hypo or hypermethylation). This abnormal-induced methylation can alter the expression of the target gene resulting in altered phenotype that is usually manifested as a wide range of pathophysiological effects.</li>
<li>Normal methylation in intergenic and repetitive elements is needed to maintain genomic stability.</li>
<li>DNA methylation in these regions is disrupted in cancer due to alterations at the DNA level such as deletion, insertion or translocation that result in genomic instability.</li>
<li>Animal and human studies showed that disruption of intergenic regions and repetitive elements could contribute to disease. For example, mutation in Dnmt3b in human is linked to the ICF syndrome. Moreover, mutation in Dnmt1 in a mouse model has been linked to an increase in genomic instability.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>The ICR in the paternal allele is methylated, there will be no CTCF binding. As a result, the enhancer acts on IgF2 gene and promotes its expression.</li>
<li>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. The binding of CTCF to the enhancer will act on H19 and IgF2 will be silent.</li>
<li>In Wilm’s tumor, IgF2 gene is overexpressed in both maternal and paternal alleles due to hypermethylation of ICR in both alleles. So, we are getting double-dose of the IgF2 which has a growth-promoting effect resulting in Wilm’s tumor</li>
<li>Hypermethylation of ICR can result in loss of imprinting.  Most of the imprinted genes are associated with growth. As a result, this disruption could cause alteration in the expression of growth restriction genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine (Dnmt inhibitor) is a nucleoside analogue that causes DNA demethylation. It is replication-dependent</li>
<li>Decitabine causes a decrease or inhibits DNA methylation.</li>
<li>Cancerous cells divide repeatedly by going through the cell cycle many times and avoiding cell cycle checkpoints. In the cell</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation deposits methyl marks on carbon 5 of cytosine. This chemical modification will be inherited and passed to the daughter strands. Depending on the degree of methylation, these marks could either activate or silence regulatory genes resulting in altered phenotype at the organismal level. Although this chemical modification has enduring effect that manifests itself in the adult stage, it can be reversible.</li>
<li>It is a period during early stages of development where gene expression is highly dynamic and susceptible to changes in response to external factors.</li>
<li>During embryonic development or early stages of development.</li>
<li>It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods since germ cells will be greatly affected. So, any induced-change of the component of the epigenetic machinery by drugs will have affect subsequent generation (transgenerational epiognetic effect).</li>
