    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer so that there is genome-wide hypomethylation and locus-specific hypermethylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for life. In mammals, DNA methylation is required for proper embryogenesis and development, for sustaining chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression states. DNA methylation of CpG islands is found in the inactive X chromosome. The methylation pattern is faithfully passed into dividing somatic cells in a similar fashion as the genetic code.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated, causing silencing of the underlying genes. These CpG islands are usually found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Such locus-specific hypermethylation progresses with tumoricity, increasing from normal tissue through hyperplastic tissue to neoplasia and metastasis.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation occurs in RB promoter (associated with retinoblastoma),  MLH1 promoter (associated with hereditary colorectal cancer), BRCA1 promoter (associated with breast cancer), and MGMT promoter (associated with gliomas and colorectal cancers).</p>
<p>In a normal cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated. This genome-wide hyper<span>methylation maintains genomic stability. Methylation of intergenic regions prevents deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations of chromosomes as well as silences cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic slice sites. Methylation of repeats leads to silencing of repeats, resulting in prevention of transposition, avoidance of transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and prevention of illegitimate recombination.</span></p>
<p><span>In cancer, the intergenic regions and repeats are hypomethylated, resulting in genomic instability. Such genome-wide hypomethylation occurs to some extent in every tumor and progresses with tumorigenicty. Such genomic instability includes illegitimate recombinations of repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</span></p>
<p><span>A mutation in DNMT3B results in hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repeats and gives rise to immunodeficiency cranio-facial defect (ICF) syndrome. Hypomethylation in CpG poor promoter regions is also seen in human cancers, such as R-RAS in gastric cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA demethylating agents. It is a DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor.</p>
<p>During replication, DNMT1 binds to DNA to copy the methylation to the daughter strand. Decitabine, a nucleoside analog, gets incorporated into DNA strands. Its presence during replication binds DNMT1 irreversibly so that DNMT1 can no longer copy the methylation to the daughter strand. Its action is replication-dependent, resulting in hypomethylation after several rounds of replication. It affects cancer cells more than normal cells as replication occurs more in cancer cells.</p>
<p>In cancer, DNA methylation at the CpG islands of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes causes silencing of these genes. Decitabine acts to reduce DNA methylation at the CpG islands, releasing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. There may be other mechanisms of action which are not yet elucidated. Decitabine is FDA-approved for use in myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable: the methylation pattern is faithfully passed into dividing somatic cells. Thus, drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods refer to periods when the environment is able to have an effect on epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development occurs in pre-implantation and early post-implantation development of the embryo as well as in primordial germ cell development. During these sensitive periods, DNA methylation marks are reset; they are removed and subsequently re-established through successive cell divisions.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as they would interfere with resetting of DNA methylation marks. Such drugs may interfere with the removal and subsequent re-establishment of DNA methylation marks during early embryo development, resulting in alteration of gene expression in cells that undergo cell division and differentiation from embryonic stem cells. They would also interfere with the resetting of DNA methylation marks in the primordial germ cells which will later form the oocyte or spermatocyte. Thus epigenetic alteration in gene expression might be seen not only in the generation of the embryo but also potentially transgenerationally via the gametes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele. When the ICR is methylated, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR to insulate the enhancers from acting on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF can bind to the ICR, insulating Igf2 from the enhancers; Igf2 will be silenced on the maternal allele, but the enhancers will act on H19.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting occurs when there is also methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, resulting in Igf2 being expressed from the maternal allele as well. The normally silent maternal allele becomes active and Igf2 is biallelically expressed. Igf2 is growth promoting and this is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the linked Kcnq1 and  H19/Igf2 clusters is also associated with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. In this disease, there is loss of Cdkn1c expression due to methylation of the Kcnq1 cluster on the maternal allele, resulting in a loss of tumor suppressor function. There is also upregulation of Igf2 due to methylation of the ICR on the H19/Igf2 cluster on the maternal allele, resulting in growth promotion.</p></div>
