In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification in which a methyl group is added to certain cytosines that are followed by a guanine in the DNA (called CpGs). At some gene promoters there are clusters of this CpGs called CpG islands, when a CpG island in a promoter is methylated, the gene is silenced.</p>
<p>It have been seen that in cancer the CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated. As these islands tend to be in promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the hypermethylation of CpG islands contribute to cancer by silencing these tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA is also methylated in CpGs which aren’t part of islands, but are located in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, and its normal state is to be methylated to inactivate these repetitive elements and keep the stability of the genome. In cancer cells these CpGs tend to be hypomethylated, which contributes to disease by leading to genomic instability (incorrect recombination and activation of repetitive sequences that can make copies of themselves and transpose to other regions of the genome, disrupting genes or inducing expression of silenced genes)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated, and a protein called CTCF is bound to this control region, which isolates lfg2 from enhancers that are located downstream, so there is no expression of lfg2 and H19 is expressed.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated and the CTCF protein no longer binds to it, so the downstream enhancers can act on lfg2, which leads to lfg2 expression and H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is also hypermethylation on the maternal imprint control region, so it now behaves like the paternal allele, which leads to double expression of lfg2 and no expression of H19. As lfg2 is a growth promoter, this leads to Wilm’s tumour disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. It inhibits the DNA-methyltransferases which are responsible for adding methyl groups to the DNA.</p>
<p>In normal cell division, when the DNA replicates, the template strand remains methylated and the new strand is unmethylated, then the DNA-methyltransferases recognize the methylation marks of the template strand and lay down methyl groups in the new strand, maintaining methylation through cell divisions. If the action of the DNA-methyltranferases is inhibited by Decitabine, then the methylation marks cannot be layed down on the new strand and the methylation is lost through cell divisions.</p>
<p>Myelodysplastic syndromes seem to depend on the hypermethylation (and therefore silencing) of the tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine has anti-tumor effects because the tumor suppressor genes are again hypomethylated and active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are mitotically hereditable (they are passed to the daughter cells when the cell divides). If the drug treatment changes the epigenome, these changes can be preserved even after the treatment has ended.</p>
<p>There are periods when the epigenome is reprogrammed, called sensitive periods, in which most of the epigenetic marks are removed, and then are gradually resettled. These periods are the pre-implantation period after conception and the primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients in a sensitive period because the alteration to the epigenetic machinery in this phase can lead to an incorrect resettling of the epigenetic marks and cause disease.</p></div>
