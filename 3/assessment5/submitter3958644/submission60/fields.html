    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer.  Cancer is caused by failure of checks and balances that control cell numbers in response to the needs of the whole organism.  Inappropriate functions that promote or inhibit cell growth or survival can be caused by error introduced into the genetic code itself or by faulty epigenetic mechanisms deciding which genes can and cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a single methyl group to cytosine position 5.  In mammals, it happens only on cytosines preceding guanine in the DNA sequence.  The majority of CpG sites in human are methylated.  Methyl groups flag approximately 5-6% of cytosines in healthy cells.  CpG methylation is a silencing epigenetic mark and may have developed as a defense against expression of parasitic DNA elements.  5-methylcytosine represents only 1% bases in the human genome.</p>
<p> DNA in normal cells is hypermethylated globally with hypomethylated CpG islands. The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is gene silencing. Some transcription start sites are flanked by CpG islands.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by becoming hypermethylated.  However, globally, DNA is hypomethylated in cancer cells.  Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contirbutes to disease by promoting the expression of cancer causing genes.  </p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is required for normal embryogenesis and development, chromosomal stability, telomere length, predetermined gene expression, imprinting, x-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements carcinogenesis.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer by becoming hypomethylated.  Epigenetic silencing by DNA methylation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes, apoptsis mediators, nuclear receptors, transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, and many other genes has been reported in multiple cancer types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Imprinting is  an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone modulation in order to achieve monoallelic gene expression without altering genetic sequence.  The regulation of gene imprinting occurs at CpG enriched imprinting control regions (ICR), a differentially methylated region that is variably methylated depending upon parent of origin during gonadal development and is involved in gene silencing.  The ICR is normally utilized by the cell as a switch to permanently inactivate transcription, thereby allowing mono-allelic expression of a given gene to control gene dosage.  </p>
<p>IGF2 is usually imprinted such that only the paternal allele is expressed.  The H19/Igf2 ICR of the paternal IGF2 allele is methylated thus blocking the binding of CTCF to the ICR.  This allows enhancers to act on the IGF2 promoter resulting in normal gene dosage. </p>
<div>The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, thus allowing CTCF to bind to the maternal ICR which creates a physical barrier that blocks the binding of enhancers to the IGF2 promoter which results in the lack of IGF2 expression.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wilm's tumor is disruption in Igf2.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igft cluster results in expression of both alleles or no expression suppression of the normal allele).</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).  Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while other similar drugs can be incorporated into DNA and RNA.  </p>
<p>The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is an overall decrease in DNA methylation genomic wide.  The overall decrease in DNA methylation can act to decrease the hypermethylation of promoter regions, CpG islands, CpG island shores  cthat are observed in cancer cells.  </p>
<p> Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by reprogrammig of the DNA methylation pattern of the cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment by reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns.  Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark which is passed on to subsequent cell generations,  administration of drugs that alter DNA methylation, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.  </p>
<p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome by somatic maintenance.</p>
<p>Sensitive period means gametogenesis, period after fertilization, and imprinting.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it could disrupt the established methylation pattern.</p>
