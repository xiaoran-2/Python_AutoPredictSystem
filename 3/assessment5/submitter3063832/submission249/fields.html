    <div class="field-value"><p>A part of all CpG sites present in the genome are clustered into CpG islands that are enriched at about 60 % of all genes in the human genome containing a CpG island upstream. The methylation status of CpG islands can influence gene expression. DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification, resulting in the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring.</p>
<p>As compared with normal cells, the malignant cells show major disruptions in their DNA methylation patterns. Hypomethylation usually involves repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements, whereas hypermethylation involves CpG islands. Many tumors show some kind of hypermethylation of one or more genes and results in loss of expression of a variety of genes critical in the development of breast cancer as well it is associated with many leukemias and other hematologic diseases. Hypomethylation is the second kind of methylation defect that is observed in a wide variety of malignancies.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation can be accomplished in several ways; in particular, by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNA Metase) and/or S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHase). In normal cells, CpG islands and CpG island shores usually remain unmethylated, allowing gene transcription. Additionally, DNA methylation within the gene bodies avoids spurious transcription initiations. In cancer cells, by contrast, although both CpG islands and CpG island shores may be strongly methylated, gene bodies lack this modification. As a result, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and aberrant transcription may occur from incorrect transcription start sites. In normal cells, methylation of repetitive sequences prevents genomic instability and, again, spurious transcription initiations. Moreover, transposable elements cannot be activated in a methylated environment. In cancer cells, global hypomethylation triggers genomic instability and aberrant transcription initiations. Concomitant activation of transposons may lead to gene disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The exact definition of decitabine is that it is a methyltransferase inhibitor that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. The molecular mechanisms by which aberrant DNA methylation takes place during carcinogenesis are still not clear. However, the large number of target genes (involved in tumorigenesis) that are silenced by aberrant methylation suggests that inhibition of this process may have potential as cancer therapy. Decitabine  is a potent and specific hypomethylating agent and an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase activity that mediates DNA methylation. Decitabine has been shown to have a broad range of antineoplastic activity in preclinical studies.Decitabine works by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes             is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans (and other mammals like mice and pigs) the <em>IGF2</em> allele inherited from the father (paternal) is expressed; the <em>IGF2</em> allele inherited from the mother is not; while H19 is expressed from the maternal allele, an not from the paternal. If both alleles (maternal and paternal of IGF2 or maternal and paternal of H19) should begin to be expressed in a cell, that cell may develop into a cancer. It is thought that, in the case of Wilm's tumours, the origin can be in a silencing of the maternal H19, leading to loss of methylation and activation of the maternal IFG2 allele as secundary event.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks of DNA, differently to DNA sequence, change during the life of any given person. Epigenetic changes during life could explain why we are more susceptible to diseases with the past of the years. Epigenetic changes can be produced as a result of external factors like diet, physic exercise or any other exposal to environment. General health of genome is possible to be inherited. So, changes induced in our epigenetics marks by drugs can even be with us for the rest of our lives and be inherited by our descendants in that sense. There are what we call "sensitive periods" which are simply periods of our life in which we are more prone to have our genome affected by such environmental factors. Such periods are commonly identified with early years. In such periods is not advisable to treating patients with drugs, since we could induce undesirable changes in their genome.</p></div>
