    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation refers to the addition of methyl group to C5 of the cytosine residue and is the most common epigenetic mark. In normal cells, CpG islands which are usually present at the promoter regions of genes are not methylated irrespective of their activity state. However, in case of cancer, the CpG islands are hypermethylated and a global hypomethylation is observed. This hypermethylation causes silencing of the gene (tumour suppressor) which leads to cell proliferation and angiogenesis which is a trademark of cancer. According to the Knudson hypothesis, multiple hits are required to cause cancer and one of the hit is DNA hypermathylation at the CpG islands. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected but are however reversible, unlike mutations. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is most common and their identification vary by tumour type. certain biomarkers associated with this are RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer, BRCA1 in breast cancer and MGMT in gliomas and colorectal cancers. They can be used as biomarkers which help in distinguishing the cancer cell from the normal cell. Usually, the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is frequentl mutated which are distinct with each tumour. Hence, diagnosis and prognosis using DNA methylation is quite favourable. It has also been studied that CpG island shores i.e 2kb upstream and downstream are usually hypermethylated. Few cancers such as Wilm's tumour results due to hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs). In a normal cell, the amount of DNA methylation at the promoter and intergenic regions is low. However, in case of cancer cells, there is an increased hypermethylation observed in both the promoter and intergenic regions. And this disruption leads to cancer as it results in the silencing of the gene leading to cll proliferation, angiogenesis,activates invasion, replicative immortality, genetic instability, tumour promoting inflammation and resists cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting leading to cancer is best studied by the H19/IGF2 cluster example leading to Wilm's tumour where hypermethylation of the Imprint Control Regions are observed. In a normal cell, paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the patrenal allele but are unmethylated at the maternal allele. Howeve, in case of Wilm's tumour, the maternal chromosome reverses the epigenotype to the paternal chromosome with a paternal gene expression i.e IGF2 switched on, H19 switched off and methylation of the sites upstream to H19. This loss of imprinting leading to silencing of H19 and expression of IGF2 in the maternal chromosome is associated with growth leading to cell proliferation. <span>Loss of imprinting of IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumour .</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug used to treat AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)  .It is a hypomethylating agent i.e hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Hence, it helps to restore the normal function of the tumour suppressor genes which are silenced due to CpG hypermethylation, thus re-exerting the control of growth and reproduction to the cells. It also helps the bone marrow to make normal cells. <span>Secondly, decitabine is an antimetabolite, which interrupts the cell cycle. Antimetabolites are similar to normal substances found in a cell. When the cancer cell takes in the decitabine, it can no longer divide (reproduce). If the cells are unable to divide, they die.</span> Hence, decitabine shows anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has a long term impact on the genome of the individual as these changes are passed on to the daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once they are erased, it does not return and also does not kill the useful cells which is one of the effects of chemotherapy. Hence epigentic drugs which are used in the market or are in the trials are more useful. Some of these are used in conjunction with chemotherapy and has been found to be very effective. <span> Sensitive periods in epigenetics refers to the early life which constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms which<span> includes DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. It is observed during primordial germ development and during pre-implantation.<span> It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms.Treating patients during this period is inadvisable as development of complex phenotypes occur during this period and could lead to changes in the epigenetic machinery. </span></span></span></p></div>
