    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes in cancer occur in a number of different ways. 1. CpG islands are areas of DNA (or RNA) that have a high concentration of Cytosine and Guanine connected by phosphodiester bonds (C-p-G), 300-3000 bps in length. They are often found in or near promoter sites in the genome. In various types of cancer these areas become hypermethylated leading to possible silencing of the expression of the genes that they regulate. This is believed to abnormal activity of DNA-methyltransferase enzymes like DNMT1., that fail to recognize the correct areas of DNA to be methylated and instead methylate CpG islands that are usually sparsely methylated in the normal cell. When this is a tumor suppressor gene whose other copy has already been modified by a previous genetic or epigenetic change it could cause initiation of cancers. Once this aberrant cell line begins reproducing it has a survival advantage compared to other cells leading to progression of the cancer.</p>
<p>At intergenic regions and repetitive elements DNA is often methylated causing silencing of the genetic code in these regions. These are often tissue-specific imprinted regions or Imprint control regions related to parent-of-origin specific organism wide imprinting. Cancer cells often exhibit genome –wide hypomethylation in many of these areas that are normally methylated causing activation of normally transcriptionally silent elements such as imprinted genes and repeat sequences – this leads to genomic instability and, in some cases, dysregulated clonal proliferation of such cells causing cancer or to metastasis of already existent cancers. Again, dysfunctional DNMts are thought to play an important role in the causation of these changes. Especially, the stem cell origin hypothesis for cancers is compatible with this idea, as stem cells have distinct epigenetic profiles compared to other somatic cells, like hypomethylated DNA and loss of imprinting. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGF2 gene is located 90 kb upstream from the H19 gene on both the maternal and paternal 11 chromosomes. There is a 2 kb area immediately before the H19 promoter area which is methylated on the paternal chromosome but not the maternal chromosome and so is called a DMR (differentially methylated region). When this area is unmethylated it binds a factor called CTCF(CCCTC-binding factor), a DNA-binding protein with a “zinc fingers” domain. CTCF interacting with the DMR between Igf1 and H19 genes leads to insulation of the enhancers that are downstream of the H19 locus from the Igf2 locus thereby preventing their access to the Igf2 locus thereby repressing Igf2 mRNA transcription. On the paternal chromosome the unmethylated DMR is unable to bind CTCF allowing for enhancer access to Igf2 and this leads to Igf-2 production.</p>
<p>In cancers such as Wilm’s tumour this process is dysregulated by epigenetic mechanisms that cause demthylation of the DMR thus allowing for enhancer access to Igf2 locus on the maternal chromosome as well, effectively leading to double dosage of the active Igf2 locus, whereas normally only the paternal locus is active. This leads to increased Igf2 activity, causing increased cell growth</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be induced by environmental changes and therapeutic agents. Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable – i.e., they are passed along to daughter cells from one generation to the next, thus propagating the given epigenetic changes to a large number of cells over time. Thus altering the epigenome can give rise to lasting effects that persist beyond the index period of environmental change or drug exposure that initiated the changes in the first place.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development where active reprogramming of epigenetic modifications of the genome occurs – by en-masse erasure of such epigenetic marks and their re-establishment in different areas of the genome which can occur in both whole-organism and tissue-specific modes. Such periods of development include the pre-implantation, implantation and primordial germ cell development period. During such periods the epigenome is exquisitely susceptible to environmental alterations.</p>
<p>When drugs that alter epigenetic  mechanisms are used during such sensitive periods they have the potential to alter these marks, not just in the tumor cells, but also in normal cells. While this can happen even during other periods of time, suring sensitive periods there is a greater risk of such modifications being carried out on a genome-wide basis, thus causing unwanted alterations. Young adults are at particular risk during such periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to a class of drugs called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNAMi’s). Many cancers are associated with epigenetic changes such as CpG hypermethylation which is thought to be due mainly to dysregulated and pathologically increased activity of DNA methyl transferase enzymes such as DNMT-1. This excessive methylation can cause transcriptional silencing of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) leading to cancer.</p>
<p>Many epigenetic changes can be potentially reversed) through interventions, DNAMi’s are one group of drugs that can do this by inhibiting methylation of genetic loci thus reactivating TSGs and induce the reprogramming of cancer cells, leading to their proliferation arrest and ultimately to their death.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a selective DNA methylation inhibitor that has been FDA approved for use in myelodysplastic syndromes. It is exported into cells and then is incorporated into the DNA during the S (synthesis) phase after which it irreversibly binds DNMt preventing its release and thereby halting further DNA synthesis. </p></div>
