    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal cells have hypomethylated CpG islands (so the gene can be expressed) where else in cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to inappropiate gene silencing, such as tumor supressor genes. This hypermethylation is one of the multiple hits that can result in cancer, it ocours frequently in tumours and it is mitotically heritable, progressing with time. It's important to notice that, unlike mutations, epimutations are reversable so this knowledge can be used for a possible treatment. The hypermethylated CpG reagions can be found by studies of genome-wide DNA and used as biomarkers to distinguish tumours cells from normal cells (used for diagnosis), it can also be used for prognosis and used as a monitor of the tumour condition. Recent studies also found that regions surrounding CpG islands also tend to be hypermethylated in cancer cells, which could improve the prediction of tests using the biomarkers. <br />In normal cells the intergenic reagions and repetitive elements are hypermethilated, where in cancer cells both reagions are hypomethylated. It ocours in every tumour type and also happens early in tumerogenisis, progressing with time. The hypomethylation in repeats have more severe consequences than in intergenic reagions. The consequence of such hypomethylation of those reagions is the genomic instability, with possible activation and recombination between repeats (resulting in deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations) and this instability can contribute to diseases.<br />It is important to remember that DNA methylation is context dependent because different tumours can be driven by different things and also act differently in each stage, so all of the factors have to be well considered for an effective therapy.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region is methylated, therefore the CTCF does not bind to insulate the imprint control region so the enhancers can act on Igf2 and this gene is expressed on the paternal allele. As for the maternal allele, it's imprint control reagion is unmethylated, so in this case the CTCF can bind the insulator element  so the enhancers can act on H19, but Igf2 will remain silent.<br />When imprinting information is lost the paternal and maternal imprint control regions become hypermethylated and then Igf2 is also expressed on the maternal allele (where it wasn't before, in the normal condition), ending up with a double dose of Igf2 compared to the normal cell (the Igf2 from the paternal allele and the Igf2 from the maternal allele). Igf2 is known to be growth promoting and this double dose of Igf2 is associated with Wilm's tumour; so this is the mechanism of how H19/Igf2 are changed contributing to diseases such as Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMT), a DNA-demethylating agent (or hypomethylating agent) that can be used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is a nucleoside analogue (a cytidine analog) that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication. By using this drug the DNMT 1 binds the nucleotide and copies the methylation to the daughter strand that DNMT is bound in an irreversible form so it can be no longer released. DNMT is division dependent so cancer cells will be more severilly affacted to it since they replicate much more. So what decitabine does is that it hypomethylates DNA by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase and by this method it can kill the tumour cells, having the anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects lasting beyond the period of drug treatment because the epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, so the epigenetic information pattern (the effects from the drugs) continues to be passed from cell to cell at each division, until they are actively erased.<br />A sensitive period is one that passes through active remodeling of genome having the removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome, so these are the periods most sensible to changes in the environment. There are two sensitive periods of epigenetic control during the development, the first one is the period of primordial germ cells up to the production of gametes and the second one is the period of pre implantation and early post implantation (period of early development).<br />Treating patients during those sensitive periods would be inadvesable because the cells are not methylated during those periods since the epigenetic marks are erased, so the drug would not be able to demethylate; even if the drug could manage to demethylate a cell that was still methylated, the epegenetic mark would be erased after that and not passed with each cell division.</p></div>
