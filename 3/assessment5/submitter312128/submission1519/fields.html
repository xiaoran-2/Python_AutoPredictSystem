    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is widely altered in cancer, for example by allowing the expression of possibly deleterious repeat and intergenic regions (which are normally silenced through methylation) via hypomethylation -- by unpacking the hetereochromatin into euchromatin or in other words removing the hydrophobic methyl group and thereby reducing the magnitude of the electric field between the histones and the negatively charged DNA nucleotide chain  -- and targeted hypermethylation of tumor suppressors, i.e. trancriptional repression leading to possibly unbounded tumor growth in future generations of cells given mitotic heritability. In other words, where CpG islands and their shores are normally hypomethylated to ensure they promote the expression of important genes including tumor suppressors or housekeeping genes, they tend to become hypermethylated and suppress the genes they regulate in cancer. In some cases, this hypermethylation can occur on ICRs (leading to possible loss of imprinting) and cause tumors by overexpressing tumor growth factors as in the well known case of H19/IGF2 implicated Wilm's tumor. </p>
<p>Generally, the entire genome in cancer is seen to be hypomethylated however in greater detail it's apparent that it is context-dependent as indicated above.  However, either hypermethylation or hypomethylation can occur locally and lead to aberrant expression, e.g. hypermethylation of tumor suppressors or hypomethylation of repeats, which can be mobile and thus cause genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As implied above, the loss of imprinting (parental specific allelic expression) can lead to cancer. In the case of Wilm's tumor (H19/Igf2 locus) it's basically because you get too much growth promotor expression when you hypermethylate the maternal allele ICR. Normally, it is unmethylated and this allows the CTCF 'insulator' protein to bind to it, allowing the enhancers to act on the lncRNA H19 -- instead of IGF2 --  and thus IGF2 won't be expressed. On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and we get expression of what presumably is a normal amount of IGF2 because the enhancers act on IGF2 -- because CTCF is not able to bind to provide insulation. Since IGF2 is a growth factor and now both the maternal and paternal alleles are expressing it, it makes sense you observe some kind of aberrant overgrowth and in fact that's what people see with this childhood kidney tumor cancer.  </p>
<p>This explanation is still somewhat dissatisfying since I am implicitly assuming that possible overexpression of H19 from the maternal allele is not deleterious, which is at least questionable if you look at the literature.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a dna-methylating agent, i.e. it attaches (repressive) epigenetic methylation marks and seeks to repress mutated copies of whatever overactive promotor or suppressor has gone awry in the cancer. In lymphomas this is an enzyme called EZH2, whose overactivity silences via methylation histone modification the genes they surround, including tumor suppressors. By suppressing this silencing in a more subtle way and target specific way (i.e. fewer potential side effects), the cells' own tumor suppressors can then make greater progress against tumor proliferation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so thus it is has lingering transgernational effects by definiition.  A sensitive period is any developmental phase involving epigenetic reprogramming, e.g. during the rapid and active (de)methylation of the paternal genome and the passive (de)methylation in the maternal genome during <strong>primordial germ cell development</strong> (oocyte/spermato-genesis). Another sensitive period is in <strong>early development</strong>, when lineage specific marks are generated, i.e. this is the period between the gametes, the fertilized egg, and blastocyst formation, with DNA methylation systematically going down from gamete phase through to blastocyst, before climbing again at epiblast formation. </p>
<p>Thus, Early Development and Primary germ cell development as described above should be avoided for the administration of epigenetic drugs due to the delicacy of this differential resetting of epigenetic marks in the maternal and paternal genomes in general. Note that throughout all these phases repeats are highly methylated, i.e. suppressed. </p></div>
