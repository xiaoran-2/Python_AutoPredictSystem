    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally not methylated, allowing for the expression of the genes that are down-stream.  In cancer cells, these regions frequently become heavily methylated, or hypermethylated.  This results in compaction of that region of DNA, hence suppressing the expression of the down-stream genes.  This contributes to disease, since normally expressed genes (e.g., tumor suppressors) are silenced.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands may be at a single location, allowing for a single biomarker to be used diagnostically;  alternatively, it may occur at several locations, making the use of a panel of biomarkers a better diagnostic tool.  Hypermethylation of a CpG island may lead to some methylation of the CGI shores (areas of about 2 kb on either side of the island); this methylation of the CGI shores may be more easily detected.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally high.  In cancer cells, these regions become unmethylated, or hypomethylated, opening up the DNA region to genetic instability.  Various types of genetic instability that may occur are deletions, insertions, and translocations.  Also, this loss of intergenic methylation can lead to the expression of oncogenes, or the overexpression of oncogenes.  Mutation of tumor suppressor genes may also occur, due to the genetic instability.</p>
<p>Both of these features—hypermethylation of CpG islands and hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements—are mitotically heritable, rapidly selected, and reversible.  Also, hypermethylation biomarkers in normally nonmethylated regions are more easily detected.  Alteration of methylation—hypo or hyper—in imprint control regions (ICRs) may affect imprinting, thus leading to the overexpression or suppression of some genes.</p>
<p>Since some cancers are associated with hypomethylation and others with hypermethylation, the use of methylation techniques in treatment is highly context dependent.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Insulin-like growth factor (Igf2) is a gene located (in humans) on chromosome 11 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_2</a> , accessed 2013-08-19). In the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, thus silencing the expression of H19.  This allows for the enhancers (downstream from the ICR) to activate Igf2, which is on the opposite side of the ICR. The enhancers act in the opposite direction of H19, with is also silenced in the paternal allele.  In the maternal allele, the opposite situation is normal: the ICR is not methylated, thus allowing for the activation of H19, which suppresses the enhancers, consequently silencing Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor [American spelling], the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated, so H19 is silenced and the enhancers activate Igf2.  Since this mirrors the situation with the paternal allele, the offspring has a double-dose of Igf2, thus over stimulating the growth of kidney tissue, resulting in a kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a FDA approved drug treatment for certain types of leukemia [American spelling], is a DNA-demethylating agent, or DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  In cancer, as time progresses, global DNA methylation decreases, but methylation of CpG islands increases—at <em>some</em> CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes (locus-specific, not global).  Since methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the gene, this increased methylation at CpG islands silences the tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>A drug like Decitabine that is a DNMTi interferes with the methylation of the CpG islands, thus reducing or stopping the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes.  Once incorporated, the DNMTi is mitotically heritable.  So, as the tumor cells divide, the silencing of the tumor suppressor genes is diluted.  In time, the tumor is no more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Two different types of changes in DNA methylation may occur: increased methylation or decreased methylation.  Since DNA methylation leads to compaction of the chromatin, an increase in DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing, whereas demethylation allows for gene activation, as the chromatin is more open.  Epigenetic factors affecting DNA methylation are mitotically heritable, so their effects endure.  In cancer, DNA methylation may lead to silencing or increased silencing of tumor suppressor genes, whereas DNA demethylation may lead to the activation or over activation of oncogenes.  So, drugs that alter DNA methylation (one way or another) affect epigenetics, and so have effects beyond the period of treatment, since they are mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>The two periods of sensitivity are pre-embryonic development, when epigenetic marks are removed, and the development of germ cells (pre-puberty), when parental imprinting of genes is removed, then re-established.</p>
<p>Treating a patient during the period of development of germ cells may affect the re-establishment of imprinted genes, thus affecting the genes transmitted to offspring, or possibly causing sterility.  Treating a pregnant female may impact the development of the embryo by affecting the removal of epigenetic markers.  Thus, treatment during the sensitive periods is inadvisable.</p></div>
