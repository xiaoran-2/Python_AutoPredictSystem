    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer as opposed to normal cells, two broad differences seen in DNA methylation are (1) locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and (2) genome-wide DNA hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In the first case, certain CpG islands may be more methylated in cancer than in normal tissue, and since methylation of CpG islands tends to silence associated genes, when the silenced genes are tumor suppressor genes the result may constitute one of the "hits" in the Knudson multiple-hit cancer hypothesis. Thus epimutation may be an alternative mechanism to mutation in this regard, and indeed actually appears to be more frequent. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and may be rapidly somatically selected, although unlike mutation it is reversible. Which CPG islands are hypermethylated varies by tumor type, and progresses with time, though this may be confounded by changes associated with aging. Recently hypermethylation has been observed in neighboring "shores" of CpG islands in cancer, which correlate well with gene expression and may be a better predictor of expression than actual CpG island methylation.</p>
<p>Another pattern observed in early stages of cancer is alterations of DNA methylation at Imprint Control Regions (ICRs), which can be either hypo or hyper and thus lead to loss of expression of growth-restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>The second major difference seen in cancer is genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, which is seen in all tumors and progresses with tumorigenicity. When this occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it can lead to genomic instability (one of the hallmarks of cancer) due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transposons, and activitation of cryptic promoters that disrupt neighboring genes.  When CpG poor promoters are hypomethylated, genes can be activated that may be oncogenes or controlling elements such as miRNAs that target tumor suppressors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 locus provides one example of how disrution of imprinting can contribute to cancer. H19 is a long noncoding RNA, expressed only from the maternal allele due to an upstream imprinting control region (ICR). The ICR binds an insulator protein called CTCF which allows enhancers downstream of H19 to promote its expression but not the expression of a gene upstream of the ICR,  Igf2. On the paternal chromosome, however, methylation of the ICR has two effects: first, it prevents binding of the insulator CTCF so that the downstream enhancers can promote expression of the Igf2 gene, and second, spreading methylation into the H19 promoter inhibits expression of the H19 noncoding RNA.</p>
<p>If, however, there is a defect in imprinting such that the maternal allele is hypomethylated and thus behaves like the paternal allele, a double dose of the Igf2gne product will result. This is one effect of Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, which also involves the Kcnq1 cluster further upstream on the same chromosome, and because Igf2 is a growth-promoting oncogene the disease involves symptoms such as macroglossia (large tongue) and a predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumors such as Wilm's tumor of the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, and therefore causes hypomethylation by preventing either <em>de novo</em> or maintenance methylation of cytosines. A general genome-wide DNA hypomethylation is associated with cancer, but locus-specific DNA hypermethylation is also observed, and this provides opportunities for an anti-tumor effect of this drug. Likely mechanisms include the prevention of hypermethylation of CpG islands and shores associated with tumor suppressor genes, or avoiding the effects of a loss of imprinting on either tumor suppressors or growth-promoting genes. One factor that may enhance the anti-tumor effects of the drug is the rapid division of cancer cells, which in the absense of maintenance methylation by Dnmt1 would greatly accelerate of demethylation of the resulting cell population. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have a long-lasting effect because once CpG's lose their methylation marks they are no longer available to direct the methylation of newly-synthesized opposite strands of DNA via the Dnmt1 maintenance methyltransferase. This is seen, for example, in mouse development where embryos that are homozygous negative for Dnmt1 undergo a failure of imprinted X chromosome inactivation between days 8.5 and 9.5. This is therefore a sensitive period, or a span during which altered environments can have an effect on epigenetic control and therefore can influence normal development or transmission of imprinting to subsequent generations. There are two such sensitive periods in the mammalian lifecycle, one during early development (roughly from fertilization through blastocyst stage, though slightly later in the maternal than the paternal genome), and another during gamete development beginning with the appearance of primordial germ cells. Treating patients with agents that affect methylation (e.g. for cancer) is inadvisable during these sensitive periods because of the resulting generalized effects on epigenetic reprogramming, which for instance can lead to large offspring syndrome in animal husbandry since imprinted genes contribute to growth, especially in placenta.</p></div>
