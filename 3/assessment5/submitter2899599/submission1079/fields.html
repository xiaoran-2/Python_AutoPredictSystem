    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer,DNA methylation is altered in 3 ways,1)in CpG islands,2)in intergenic regions and 3) in repetitive elements.-The normal way of action of DNA methylation in CpG islands is to mantein actives the cancer suppessors genes.-In cancer cells CpG islands are hipermetilated(although not all of them).-As the neoplasia progress,the methylation of CpG islands would be bigger.-This alteration in the % of methylation contribute to silence suppessors of cancer genes.-In intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hipomethylated.-That brings genomic inestability.-This hipomethylation comes early and is seen in preneoplasics tissues.-As there is genomic inestability,abnormals kariotipes appear,with insercions,translocations and lost of part of the genes.-Besides encripted promotors are activeted and there are breaks of near by genes.-</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In  normal cells,the paternal alelo shows the Igf2 gen activeted,acting the ebhancers.The imprinting control region and H19 gen are methylated(not active).-The maternal alelo s hows Igf2 gen inactivated,and H19 gen and CTCG, actives.-In Wilm's tumour both maternal and paternal alelos have ICRs methylated as well as H19 gen.-That means that the 2 forms of Igf2 will be active.-They are growth promotors and nathing would control them.-That will leads to an  uncontroled cells multiplication.-As time goes by,this process is manteined and progress.-</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that works as a DNA metiltranferase inhibitor.-It is used in Myelodysblastic sindrome,that leads to acute leukimia mieloide.-This  inhibitor is a nucleoside analogue.-It is  binds to DNA irreversibly.-So replication is needed to see the action of this drug.-As cancer cells usually are in division process and at a high rate,they are more sensibles.-It is important to find a dose not too high,to avoid toxic effects.-The way this drug  acts is not completly understood,because it might act in cromatine readers as well.-</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation,as a epigenetic process works with mitotic inheritance.-Baylin observation shows him that using 2 epigenetic drugs(Histone de-acetilase inhibitor and Azacitidine) in lung cancer,some patients do not respond to that treatment,but if latter  the recibe tradicional quimiotherapy,they react very well.-That means that there are epigeneticts marks afected by the first treatment and they are  manteined all life.-The sensible periods are those in which there are a lot of methylation in IAPS,and in imprinted genes.-At the same time the maternal and paternal genome are variable in their % of methylation.-So it is important in which moment the treatment is done.-In those moments in which we have a lot of pluripotents cells is not convenient to use this drugs,.The sensible periods goes from the moment the zigotes found themselves  and are acoplated,till epiblast formation.-And later,in the moment when germinal cells are developing.-</p></div>
