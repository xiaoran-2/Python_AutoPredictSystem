    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often gene promoters. When a CpG island is methylated, that gene is silenced. Many CpG islands are normally protected from methylation. If normal DNA methylation is disrupted, it may lead to the silencing of tumor-suppressing genes (such as BRCA1 in breast cancer).</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetetive elements are normally methylated in DNA. These regions help maintain the stability of the genome. When they are abberantly demethylated, DNA elements may be inappropriately transposed, which can lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug. It can remove abberant DNA methylation and allow the proper expression of genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be passed mitotically to daughter and granddaughter changes until they are actively erased, and thus last across cell generations. Changes can occur naturally through sensitive periods, such as during early cell development and germ cell development when certain epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed. Treating a patient during one of these sensitive periods. would be inadvisable because it could lead to improper epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the paternal allele is methylated, blocking the binding of the CTCF insulator protein and allowing for enhancers to allow the Igf2 gene to be expressed. On the maternal allele, the H19/Igf2 cluster is demethylated, the CTCF insulator protein is absent, and enhancers activate the H19 gene instead.</p>
<p>In Beckwith Weidermann syndrome, the maternal allele becomes methylated and behaves like the paternal allele. This can result in a downregulation of Cdnkn1c, which is a tumor-suppressing gene, and and upregulation of Igf2, which is a growth-promoting oncogene. The syndrom can result in Wilm's tumor, a childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>
