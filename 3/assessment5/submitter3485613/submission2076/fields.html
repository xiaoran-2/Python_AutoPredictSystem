    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression. CpG islands are usually unmethylated. In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated. Hypermethylation at Cpg islands contributes to disease by silencing tumour suppressor genes. The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genome stability.  Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. There is DNA hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer. Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute to disease by causing genome instability. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal allele. The imprinting control region is methylated on the paternal allele therefore the insulator CTCF cannot bind to the region. Without CTCF on the paternal allele, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence the gene and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The imprinting control region is unmethylated in the maternal allele. This allows the insulator CTCF to bind to the imprinting control region. This prevents the enchancer from promoting expression of Igf2 and H19 is activated instead. Igf2 is not expressed in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, deletion or mutation can cause loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster. There may be parental disomy, where two copies are inherited from one parental chromosome. Loss of imprinting may also occur from epigenetic disruption. </p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/IGf2 cluster contributes to disease by upregulating Igf2, an oncogene that promotes cell growth. Uncontrolled cell growth leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating class of epigenetic inhibitors. Decitabine reduces the amount of histone overmethylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect because a decrease in histone methylation will allow the expression of previously silenced tumour suppressor genes and therefore stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. A sensitive period is a period of development where cancer treatment can have adverse effects. Sensitive periods of development are when a patient is young and developing. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because germ cells can be affected.</p></div>
