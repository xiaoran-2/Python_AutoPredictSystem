    <div class="field-value"><p>Q1: Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.</p>
<p>Cpg islands are genomic regions that consist of high frequency of CpG sites, which are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide (C) occurs next to a guanine nucleotide (G) which are linked by phosphate (p). DNA methylation is a biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is the process that alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. The change is normally permanent and unidirectional and prevents one organism from reverting to a stem cell or into another type of tissue.</p>
<p> An Intergenic region (IGR) is a stretch of DNA sequences located between genes. Intergenic regions are a subset of Noncoding DNA. Occasionally some intergenic DNA acts to control genes nearby, but most of it has no currently known function. Repeated sequences (aka. repetitive elements or repeats) are patterns of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) that occur in multiple copies throughout the genome. They can be compared to articles or pronouns (e.g. the word 'the' or 'she') in human language. DNA methylation serves the purpose of maintaining and increasing genomic stability in the Intergenic regions and repeated sequencing by silencing transcription and/or repeats.</p>
<p>When cancer appears in the above, aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation takes place. These have been associated with a large number of human diseases. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. Cancer is a broad group of diseases involving unregulated cell growth. These cells divide and grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors, and invade nearby parts of the body.</p></div>

answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <div class="field-value"><p>Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>Genomic imprinting involves DNA methylation and histone modulation in order to achieve monoallelic gene expression without altering the genetic sequence. In diploid organisms, somatic cells possess two copies of the genome. In mammals, however, a small portion (&lt;1%) of genes are imprinted, meaning the gene expression occurs from only one allele. The expressed allele is dependent upon its parental origin. For example, the gene encoding Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) is only expressed from the allele from the father (or paternal allele). The Igf2 gene provides instructions for making the protein - insulin-like growth factor which plays an essential role, along with the H19 gene, in growth and development before birth. Occasionally, both the paternal and maternal copies of the gene are active, increasing the amount of insulin-like growth factor 2 that cells can produce. This phenomenon is known as loss of imprinting (LOI) and may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent damaged cells from being destroyed leading to diseases such as the kidney cancer called Wilms Tumor, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma and a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q3. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer, with reference to effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent in the form of azacitidine and is sold by the Japanese company Eisai as Dacogen. It is FDA approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which is a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. It is classified as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. A methyltransferase also known as a methylase is a type of transferase enzyme that transfers a methyl group from a donor to an acceptor.  Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA upon replication and bounds the methyltransferase irreversible so that it cannot be released to cause the DNA methylation. Cancer cells in tumors, which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells, will then be more severely affected because they are replicating more and therefore decitabine will slow or impede the growth of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Q4. How can drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment?<br /> Dr. Stephen Baylin led researches that have shown that a combination of histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some advanced lung cancer cases.  This research was notable for several reasons. The first is that it showed that epigenetic drugs could be successfully deployed against solid tumors and second; that even if the initial result produced no significant results it was found those that received the drug showed an unexpected good reaction to the routine chemotherapeutic drugs which were used next. He believes that epigenetic changes were passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until erased proving that epigenetic therapies can stop cancer growth without having to kill all its cells.  Sensitive periods are predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks when the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup.  The two main sensitive periods are the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm and the pre-implanted and early post implantation period. Treating would be inadvisable during these periods because of active remodeling of the epigenome.</p></div>
