    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      Loss of Imprinting (LOI) of the insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) gene is one change that can produce tumor-initiating cells via an epigenetic progenitor model of tumorigenesis. IGF2 and H19 genes are reciprocally imprinted and closely linked. IGF2 encodes a fetal growth-factor and is predominantly expressed from the paternal allele, while the H19 gene however, is express from the maternal allele and encodes a transcript which may downregulate cellular proliferation.</p>
<p>     In Wilm's tumor, loss of imprinting of the IGF2 gene involves aberrant activation of the normally repressed maternally inherited allele, related to biallelic hypermethylation of the H19 differentially methylated region. Evidently, loss of imprinting or reactivation of the maternal allele of IGF2 is associated with an increase of IGF2 expression that may subsequently play an important role in the onset of human cancers. In cancer cell lines, in which IGF2 imprinting is maintained, essentially all of the the 'chromosome conformation capture' (3C) interactions seen in normal cells were preserved. However, in cells in which IGF2 imprinting was lost, nearly all of the long-range chromatin interactions involving IGF2 were abrogated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase. It is thought that this drug can act as an anti-metabolite. The presence of anti-metabolites can have toxic effects on cells, such as halting cell growth and cell division, so these compounds are used as chemotherapy for cancer.  However, Decitabine decreases DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, and also causes depletion of DNA hypomethylation. Because this drug inhibits DNA methylation, it seems likely that its anti-cancer activity may at least partially be the result of reversing cancer-specific epigenetic changes which is an attractive new approach to cancer therapy. As was stated earlier, this drug (Decitabine) can act as a anti-metabolite, therefore it can have anti-tumour effects in some cases, by stopping these tumorous cells from undergoing the processes of cell growth or cell division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic errors transforms a normal cell into an invasive or metastatic tumor cell. Altered DNA methylation patterns cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes. DNA hypomethylation activates oncogenes and initiates chromosome instability, whereas DNA hypermethylation initiates silencing of tumor suppressor genes. These epigenetic changes can be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of early cancer.</p>
<p>      The term, Sensitive Period is a developmental term and refers to a time when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. Primordial Germ Cell development is one sensitive period; with the second period being Pre-implantation Period and Early Development. Now, we are advised not to treat patients during sensitive periods, because this is when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, and more importantly when epigenetic marks are reestablished post-implantation. During early pregnancy alterations in the environment can also alter epigenetic makeup and adult health, due to mitotic heritability of altered epigenetic state. Therefore, we are advised not to treat patients during these periods, because this is the time when the patient is most receptive to environmental changes, and the production of potentially dangerous cells is not only undesired, but could be very harmful to the patient, and their future generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>      The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to prevent transcriptional initiation and ensure the silencing of genes on the inactive X-chromosome, embryonic development, imprinted genes, silencing of intragenomic parasites, and aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGI) promoters (promoter hypermethylation) occurs in many cancers. Thiis epigentic reprogramming is associate with the absence of transcription and can occur at a number of known tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that it contributes to tumor progression by silencing the expression of affected genes.                                                           </p>
<p>      Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease, because these CpG islands become excessively methylated in cancer cells, thereby causing genes that should not be silenced to turn off. This abnormality is the trademark epigenetic change that occurs in tumors and happens early in the development of cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands can cause tumors by shutting off tumor-suppressor genes. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>      The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetiitve elements, is to maintain genomic stability–– silencing repeats, so as to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylating repeats, which may help prevent illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation can also act as a defense model at repetitive elements – protecting the genome from transposable elements. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer, due to hypomethyaltion. Some of the DNA hypomethylation associated with cancers is likely to aid in tumor formation and progression. Hypomethylation of repetitive DNA elements is a common epigenetics event in cancer, and it is believed that hypomethelation impacts transcriptional stability of the genome.</p></div>
