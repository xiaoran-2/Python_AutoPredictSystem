    <h1>Submission 162 from Anon (session_user_id: eb1eaa570686a4b5b6f0c275224af9f92ae79318)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents, it is an enzymatic epigenetic regulator. It is sold by a Japanese company, and its function is to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (which are myelogenous leukaemia precursors). <br />Decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), enzimes that transfer methyl groups to DNA. Being a nucleoside analog, it gets incorporated into DNA during replication and it binds DNMT in an irreversible way (it can not be released).<br />Its action is division dependent: you need to have the cell replicating so that Decitabine can act. Therefore, it can have an anti-tumour effect, considering that cancer cells replicate more, so they will be more affected. <br />It is used at low doses, so that it has good effects killing cancer cells and it is no toxic for patients.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells display a loss of imprinting, showing expression from both parental alleles or having them silenced. Alterations in methylation at ICRs can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br />In the H19/Igf2 cluster in a normal cell, H19 is methylated on the paternal allele, where the enhancers act over Igf2. In the maternal allele H19 is not methylated, so CTCF binds to the ICR, and therefore the enhancers can act over H19. <br />In Wilm´s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting, and both alleles are hypermethylated on the ICR. So in this case, the enhancers act over Igf2, and as a consequence this cells will have a double dosis of Igf2 expression.<br />Considering that Igf2 is a growth promoter, this explains how its overexpression leads to tumour growth and metastasis.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of DNA methylation, though it is context dependant, is to mantain the genomic stability. Normal cells do not show methylation of the CpG islands, while in cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be hypermethylated. CpG islands are frequently found in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so and hypermethylation in this areas would lead to a decrease in the expression of those genes, contributing to the disease. Cancer cells also show hypermethylation at CpG islands shores, 2kb up and downstream the CpG island. As cancer progresses, the methylation increases. Particular methylation of CpG islands varies between different tumour types. <br />Normal cells show methylation in general in repetitive elements, intergenic regions and even introns. On the other hand, cancer cells show hypomethylation of that areas, which occurs in every tumour and it happens in an early stage. This hypomethylation has its consequences. One of them is recombination between repeats, that would not occur if there was methylation. Also the repeat can be activated with this hypomethylation, and transpose and jump, leading to a disrupt in the coding region of a gene or activating neighboring genes. So they can jump or they promoters become active, leading to transcriptional aberration of surrounding regions.<br />So hypomethylation of DNA intergenic regions and repetitive elements lead to deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations that cause genomic instability, contributing to disease.<br /><br /> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells, until they are actively erased. Once epigenetic marks are removed, they do not return.<br /> A sensitive period is a period when the enviroment may be able to influence the epigenetic makeup. They are periods when cells are more sensitive to changes in the enviroment, that could affect the epigenome.<br /> Sensitive periods of development are the periods of active remodelling of the epigenome: early development, and primordial germ cells and GC development. Also, when tissue specific differentiation takes place, there are certain times when particular organs could have sensitive periods. <br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable beacause drugs could affect DNA methylation of normal cells, leading to undesirable effects. </p></div>
