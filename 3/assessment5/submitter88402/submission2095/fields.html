    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>       </span><span style="color:#000000;">H19 contains a methylated region which acts as imprinting control region, leading to expression of H19 only from one of parental allele. Normally promoter for H19 is methylated on paternal allele and H19 gene expressed exclusively from the maternal allele. The H19 from paternal allele is not expressed. </span><span style="color:#000000;">Expression of H19 downregulates Igf2 expression through suppression of enhancers which reside downstream of H19. Therefore Igf2 is normally paternally expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">        In case of </span><span style="color:#000000;">Wilms' tumor(cancer of kidneys), promoter for H19 is hypermethylated also on maternal chromosome which leads to overexpression of Igf2. </span><span style="color:#000000;">The major role of Igf2 (Insulin-like growth factor 2) is to act as growth promoter during gestation period. Therefore overexpression of Ifg2 cause increased cell growth.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span>       </span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase (transfers methyl group to DNA) and therefore leads to DNA demethylation. Use of decitabine leads to demethylation of previously methylated promoters for tumor suppressor genes and their re-expression.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>       DNA methylation is part of epigenome which is inheritable in somatic cell division. In other words DNA methylation pattern, unlike other forms of gene regulation are passed during somatic cell division to daughter cells till it actively erased by cell machinery.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span><span>        In life of organism there are however few periods of active establishment of epigenetic marks rather than simple maintenance. Such periods are called sensitive periods. In mammals there are two major sensitive periods: gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Since DNA methylation marks are actively reestablished during these periods DNA hypo or hyper methylation drugs can lead to severe development problem. For example use of such drugs in early in period of spermatogenesis or oogenesis can lead to fertility problems.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span>       </span>Most of gene promoters (~60%) contain many CpG islands. Normaly methylation of CpG islands negatively correlates with <span>expression of </span>genes corresponding to promoters. Methylation of CpG acts two ways. First, it impedes the binding of </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">transcriptional proteins </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">to the gene. Second, </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">methylated DNA may be bound by </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">methyl-CpG-binding domain </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">proteins which can result in chromatin remodeling into <span>heterochromatin</span> via </span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">histone deacetylases recruitment</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">        In case of cancer some normally unmetylated CpG islands are methylated. This leads to deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes. Additionaly it lead to silencing tumor suppressor genes which control controlling cell cycle, programmed cell death (apoptosis) or DNA repair mechanics. Such epigenetic modification leads to mutating, replicating mass of cells.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">        On the other hand repeat and intergenic regions are generaly methylated. In this case of cancer, hypomethylation can lead to genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination and activation of repeats and transposition . This leads to increased mutation rate.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western" style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">        Hypomethylation can also lead to activation of genes with so called CpG poor promoters, which normally supressed. Such genes, called oncogenes, can result for example in excessive cell growth.</span></span></span></p></div>
