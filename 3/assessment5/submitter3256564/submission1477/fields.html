<p><span>CpG island are places in the genome where you can find more CpG dinucleotides than you would normally expect. Methylation at CpG island is usually associated with silencing of gene expression.  It is also associated with X-inactivation. DNA methylation of CpG island causes gene silencing because it is  associeted with the condensation of chromatin: proteins like mep1 e mep2 bind to the CpG dinucleotide and they alter transctipton thanks to the trascriptional repression domain they have. Methylation can also block the binding of the transcription factor. A certain numeber of cancers show a type specific CpG island methylation phenotype(CIMP), which consists in hypermethylation of the CpG island which can be found at the promoter of genes linked to tumor suppression. The hypermethylation leads to the silencing of these genes that are instrumental in the suppression of cancer. </span>Repeats and intragenic regions tend to be methylatedin normal cells.. The function of DNA methylation at these regions is to mantain genomic stability or genetic integrity. These regions tend to be hypomethylated in cancer. This event can provoke genomic instability, which is associeted with cancer. The consequence is an  illegitimate recombination between the repeats that are found on different chromosomes. Recombinantion usually happens between areas of the genome that have genetic similarity or identity. This is favored by the repeats which can be similar to others parts of the genome. Moreover  hypomethylation can activate repeats. They can make copies of themselves and can insert themselves in other part of the genome, giving rise to the so called transposons. Another consequence is the deletion of certain parts of the chromosome, or insertions; in certain cases also duplication of the whole chromosomes. The silencing of these regions, usully guaranteed in normal cells by methylation,  is disrupted in cancer, favouring the rise of mutations. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span>In Wilm’s tumor, the hypermethylation of the Imprinting Control Region(ICR) causes the overexpression of the Igf2 gene, a growth promoting gene.In normal cells, igf2 is a maternally imprinted gene, only expressed on the paternal allele.On the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated, causing the binding of CTCF. The consequence is the  enhancers that can be found near the H19 gene to enhance the expression of H19, a growth restricting gene. On the paternal allele, the methylation of the ICR stops the binding of CTCF. This, associated with the methylation of the H19 promoter, causes the silencing of the H19 gene, so the enhancers are allowed to enhance the expression of the Igf2 gene. </span></p>
<p><span>In Wilm’s tumor Igf2 is expressed by both the maternal and the paternal allele. The imprinting of the maternal allele is disrupted in this type of tumor. The ICR region on the maternal allele is methylated. This leads to the silencing of the expression of the H19 gene, , allowing the enhancers to reach and enhance the expression of the Igf2 gene. The same pattern can be found on the paternal allele. The consequence is the overexpression of the Igf2 gene.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. When the DNA replicates, decitabile is incorporated in the DNA itself. When DNMT1, a methyltransferase, tries to bind to the strand of the DNA, in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, decitibine inhibits it, by binding the methyltransferase to the DNA, not allowing it to be realesed. </span>An important characteristic of decitabile is that it is division dependent.. Since cancer cells replicate more that normal cells, they are far more affected by the inhibitor than non-cancer cells.  The downside of this inhibitor is the fact that it is not specific, because it targets all the cells that undergo division. So all the cells risk to be affected. These inhibitors have an anti-tumor maily bacause an allmark of cancer is the hypermethylation of CpG island, which causes silencing of cancer suppression genes. Demethylation of the promoters of these genes can cause the re-activation of the cancer suppression genes. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs which alter DNA methylation are effective beyond the period of treatment because an allmark of epigenetics marks is their mitotic hereditability. They are transmitted to the daughter cells when a cells undergoes mitosis.Certain periods of development should be avoided when using this kind of methylation altering drugs. They are called sensitive periods, i.e. periods of development during which the epigenetic marks are being established. The first is the period of preimplantation development( before implantation of the embryo) and the second is the period of germ cell development. During these periods DNA methylation is removed, exept for methylation of repeats, and it is subsequently re-estalished in a tissue specific way. These are also the periods in which imprinting of genes is estalished.Using these drugs in these periods could cause an alteration of the normal establishment of epigenetic marks, which could in turn cause more alteration of gene expression or more genomic instability. </span></p>
