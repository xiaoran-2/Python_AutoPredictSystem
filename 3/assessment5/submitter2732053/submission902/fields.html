    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation mainly takes place in the cytosine of CpG (i.e., A dinucleotide of cytosine and guanine linked by a phosphate) islands thanks to the action of DNA methyltransferases. CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, but in cancer, aberrant hypermethylation takes place specially in CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes. This hypermethylation in CpG islands suppresses the expression of these tumour suppressor genes and normally is associated with a poor prognosis, although this prognosis is not the same in all tumour types. This blockade of the expression of tumour suppressor genes allows the uncontrolled growth of these cells, one of the main characteristics of cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells we can also find intergenic regions as well as repetitive elements normally methylated, not in cancerous cells though, where these regions tend to be hypomethylated. This hypomethylation in repeats and intergenic regions was the first epigenetic abnormality found in cancerous cells which results in genomic instability in several ways (e.g., Recombination between repeats, activation of transposons, ...). All these genomic alterations further alterate the normal genetic material of the cell, becoming more malignant and resistant to antitumoral therapy. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine and azacitidine belong to the group of DNA-demethylating agents, therefore they are epigenetic drugs and they are both used to treat the same disease. Compared to other epigenetic drugs that are still in human trials, these two are already available on the market. Although the mechanism of action of Decitabine is more complex than it was previously thought, this drug is being used in clinical practice to treat Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Decitabine acts irreversibly binding to DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) and therefore inhibiting DNMT activity. CpG islands of tumour suppressing genes can then be demethylated allowing the expression of these genes and blocking the uncontrolled growth of tumoral cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be passed to daughter cells during cellular division. By modifying the epigenome with these drugs, changes in cells can be passed through some generations of daughter cells, therefore the effect of the drug will last until these epigenetic modifications are actively removed</p>
<p>During the life of each human being, cells go through what are called sensitive periods. These periods are called sensitive because it is when epigenetic reprogramming is taking place and the cells are going through an enormous amount of epigenetic modifications. These phases are two: early development (preimplantation embryo) and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>By treating patiens during their sensitive periods (e.g., A pregnant mother treated before preimplantation) their progeny will be probably affected, either by affecting the embryo or the germ cells themselves. Therefore, treatment with epigenetic drugs should be avoided in all fertile patiens until it is not demonstrated that these therapies can be used without transgenerational effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 clusterworks the following way: the Imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele impeding the binding of the CTCF protein. When CTCF is not bound, methylation also occurs in the promoter of the lncRNA H19. This methylation at the promoter of H19 allows the access of enhancers to Igf2 and therefore gets expressed.  </p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing the binding of CTCF protein. With the binding of this protein the enhancers do not promote the expression of Igf2 but enhance the expression of H19.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is related with loss of imprinting problems involving the expression of Kcnq1 cluster and Igf2/H19 cluster. What normally happens is that patients have to paternal alleles and therefore Igf2 is expressed much more (since it is not imprinted in paternal alleles). Igf2 is a growth promoter and therefore cells grow much faster. Wilm's tumour is a tumour comonly found in the kidney in patients with Beckwith and Wiedeman syndrome. </p>
<p>By disrupting the H19/Igf2 cluster, the expression of Igf2 is altered promoting the uncontrolled growth of cells.</p></div>
