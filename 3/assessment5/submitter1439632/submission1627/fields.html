    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are unmyethylated, allowing the downstream gene to be regulated. This process is disrupted in cancer by hypermethylation of the CpG islands. Methylation of these locations provide an alternative mechanism for silencing of tumor suppressor genes. In the Knudson "two-hit" hypothesis, DNA methylation within the CpG islands may act as a hit. This epigenetic mutation also contributes to the spread of the tumor as it is mitotically heritable and quickly selected. For example, hypermethylation at the CpG island of the BRCA1 has been studied in the context of breast cancer. Hypermethylation at CpG islands may also be used as singular biomarkers for the purposes of prognosis, diagnosis, and monitoring treatment.</p>
<p>DNA methylation also plays an important role in the regulation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. In normal cells, we tend to see these regions methylated. In tumor cells, however, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements may be hypomethylated. This contributes to genomic instability including illigitimate recombination of repetitive elements, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters may also result in inappropriate gene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. As an epigenetic drug, decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Many tumors are caused by genetic mutations that lead to overly methylated histones and silencing of the surrounding genes, including tumor suppressors whose role is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. If Dectabine is able to demethylate these histones and counteract the mutated gene, the tumor suppressors could remain activated and continue to control proliferation. Dectabine is currently used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (prior to acute myelogenous leukaemia).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant methylation that occurs at imprinting control regions (ICRs) may also contribute to cancer by causing a loss of expression of growth restricting genes, or overexpression of growth promoting genes. In normal cells, the ICR is methylated which prevents the binding of CTCF and allows the enhancers to activate Igf2 expression. Conversely, CTCF is able to bind to the unmethylated insulated element on the maternal allele, which means that the enhancers now act on H19 and Igf2 is not activated.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated resulting in double the dose of Igf2 expression. Igf2 is known to be growth promoting so disrupting the imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster could lead to too much cell growth (such as in Wilm's tumor) or too little cell growth (in the case that the ICR is unmethylated on the paternal allele).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have a lasting effect on the epigenome because it is known to be mitotically heritable. Therefore, if the cells are epigenetically modified by a drug, all subsequent cells will inherit the same methylation patterns.</p>
<p>A "sensitive" period referrers to a time in the cell life when epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, are established rather than maintained.  In mammals, the sensitive periods occur from primordial germ cell development to the production of gametes as well as preimplantation and early post implantation. It would not be advisable to alter DNA methylation during these periods as this is when the epigenome is actively remodeled. Such treatment may disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming and be transgenerationally heritable.  </p>
