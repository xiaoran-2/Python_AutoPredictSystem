    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Physiologically, methylation of CpG sites acts as an inhibitortor on the expression of the gene after the locus of the CpG Island. This type of methylation is crucial to the concept of genetic imprinting. It is common for methylation to occur near the CpG Island sites (in regions termed CpG island shores), rather than on the islands themsleves.</li>
<li>In cancer, GpG islands are hypermethylated in areas with Tumour Suppresor Genes, leading to a disinhibition of tumour growth, thus allowing the tumour to grow. Such events have also been observed in CpG Island shores, associated with cancer, with a better correlation than that described for CpG islands themselves.</li>
<li>As described above, the inhibition of tumour supressor genes, caused by this epimutation leads to one of two hits, as suggested by the famous Two Hit Knudson Hypothesis. The main difference with tumours arising from actual mutations in Tumour Suppresor Genes, is that epimutations in those sites have been shown to be reversible.</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repetitve elements, have control elements, controlling the expression of nearby genes. They are usually methylated, as hey are non-transcribable pieces of genetic code.</li>
<li>In cancer we can encounter two variables in these structures: hypomethylation of these regions and hypermethylation of these regions.</li>
<li>Hypomethylation, can lead to genomic instability (leading to abnormal cell phenotypes, evidenced by human cancers and animal models). Hypermethylation, on the other hand, can lead to loss of expression of growth restricting genes or, overexpression of growth promoting genes.</li>
</ul><p>   It should be noted that there have been some cases of hypomethylation of poor CpG promoters, which may also contribute to overexpression of Tumour proliferation genes, but these cases are far more unlikely than those described above.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, which has been FDA approved for cancer therapy.</li>
<li>Drugs of that type irreversibly bind DNMTs after they areincorporated into DNA, therefore replication dependent. This results in decrease of DNA methylation. </li>
<li>Decitabine acts by reversing epigentic changes, more specifically DNA methylation. In hypermethylated tissues, this results in reinstatement of normal methylation, which in turn turns on the tumour suppresor genes, formerely inhibited, resulting in overgrowth of the tissue. This can happen only in sustained dosage, however, as overdose can inhibit methylation in all tissues, leading to toxicity effects in other tissues.</li>
</ul><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>  H19 contains a differentially methylated region that is also an imprinting control region. This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent while the maternal copy is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with H19 expression. As methylation of the promoter reaches 100%, H19 expression from that promoter approaches 0. At the same time as H19 expression decreases, the expression of IGF2, a neighboring gene on chromosome 11, increases (for questions 1&amp;2).</li>
<li> Wilm's tumour is a case of hypomethylation of ICR regions. Usually, there is a strict regulation, via methylation of the ICF region,  which restricts the levels of Igf2.</li>
<li>  So, imprinting in the Igf2 locus is lost, due to ICF overexpression leading to the an abundance of Igf2, which promotes cell proliferation and thus promotes tumour growth.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li> Epigenetic changes induced by the use of a drug have been shown to be heritable to the daughter cells of that cell and therefore can affect the whole germline, preventing epigenetic mutations from re-arising, at least to that particular subset of genes.</li>
<li>Sensitive period of epigenetics is a period where imprinting occurs and the DNA is more suscpetible to epigenetic changes.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods of development, as far as the epigenome is concerned, are the first weeks of development in utero, as well as the last weeks of gestation and the early childhood to puberty years of developpment, where gametes are produced.</li>
<li>Treating patients in childhood or ealy adulthood with epigenetic treatments would not be advisable due to the non-targeting nature of epigenetic drugs, as well as the high level of sensitivity the epigenome shows as a whole during these periods. Epigenetic treatment in these periods could result to hypomethylation of the whole genome and thus lead to genomic instability.</li>
