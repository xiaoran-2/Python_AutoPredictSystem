In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CPGislands occur at promoter regions of the gene and are normally unmethylated. Abnormal hypermethylation of CPGi which is seen in cancer generally leads to silencing of a gene which should be expressed. Areas of the genome 2 kbases up and downstream from CPG 'islands' ( the 'shores') are also hypermethylated in cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements the DNA is normally methylated. In cancer genome wide hypomethylation is an early change. SIlencing of genes can lead to disease by </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs developed to interfere with the epigenetic machinery will affect all dividing cells, cancerous and normal. Once changed the status of the methylation marks on the DNA are usually stable on the parent alleles ( cancerous and normal alike ) and copied at cell division to the daughter alleles and so passed on. Unless one seeks to actively remove these mehtylation changes you will thus see the effects in every subsequent generation of cells even when the drugs are stopped</p>
<p>Epigenetically sensitive periods occur when methylation marks are removed and replaced during normal development. Methylation of important sections of DNA control gene expression, both of normal and mutated genes. This occurs before birth when your future DNA was having its imprint control regions scrubbed and reprogrammed early in embryonic development, and long before you were whole - when sperm was developing in the testis of your father and even before that when the egg was in your mother as a child 6-10 years old! </p>
<p>If a patient is young the effect on their germ cells will be remain unknown until such time as they choose to have a child. Considering this epigenetic drugs should be classified as teratogens.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genome wide studies show tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation is more frequent than DNA mutations in oncogenesis. Broad inhibition of a basic methylating enzyme, DNA methyltransferase seeks to negate this. Decitabine is one such DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). It mimics a nucleoside and is incorporated into the genome of daughter cells during cell division so it targets only dividing cells. Tumour cells divide rapidly, normal cells more rarely.</p>
<p>Unlike a nucleoside Decitabine irreversibly binds the DNMTi when abnormal methylation of a cancerous cell is being copied, making the daughtercell function like a non-cancerous cell. It works best as a targeted therapy for cancers driven by hypermethylation at CpG islands (which usually causes abnormal gene silencing) eg haematological cancers have tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The side effect of further hypomethylation, forcing silence of normal genes and creating unstable DNA is llike traditional chemo therapy which genrally poison cell function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>IGf2 is a growth promoter. Too much causes disease including cancer such as WIlms tumour. The gene expressing IGf2 is normally active only on the paternal allele, and silenced by methylation on the maternally imprinted allele. Activating the maternal allele by removing methylation of H19 gives a double dose.</p></div>
