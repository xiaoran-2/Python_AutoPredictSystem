    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to regulate transcription of these areas. Methylation at these areas can either silence or activate. In cancer, the methyltransferases may disfunction, causing some areas that are normally methylated to be unmethylated, and vice versa. This can disrupt the way DNA functions, some genes will be transcribed which shouldn't be, some will be silenced. This way, for example, tumor suppressors can be silenced, which can be a first step to a malignant tumor forming.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is for silencing. The repetitive elements have strong promoters, which can then activate some genes which shouldn't be active, and they can act as transposons, inserting themselves into random areas around the DNA. If they, for example, insert before a growth factor receptor gene, their strong promoters cause the gene to be transcribed a lot, and this can be a first step towards a cancer cell. In cancer, the methylation of these areas isn't normal, they can be unmethylated and cause genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 on the paternal allele is active. It is a growth factor which promotes the growth of the cell. On the paternal allele, it is methylated, on the maternal it is not. On the maternal allele, CTCF can bind, insulating Igf2, and the enhancers will act upon H19. On the paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed instead, there is no CTCF binding because of no methylation. In Wilm's tumour, the imprinting is disrupted, there will be methylation on the maternal allele and therefore Igf2 is expressed from there too. This promotes cancer, as there are now 2 alleles expressing Igf2. This results in embryonal or childhood tumour of the liver. So in this case, the maternal chromosome is acting like the paternal chromosome, because of the mutation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It can de-methylate repetitive elements for example, which may be the cause of the cancer. In that case, overexpression of a gene/genes can be stopped, and therefore the cells will stop growing and their endless mitosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic reprogramming happens. There are 2 major sensitive periods, one in early embryonic development, and one when the primordial germ cells are formed. In these periods I would avoid treating patients with any drug that alters epigenetics. If we interfere in these periods, the results can be disastrous, from the embryo not forming to having no sperm, etc.</p></div>
