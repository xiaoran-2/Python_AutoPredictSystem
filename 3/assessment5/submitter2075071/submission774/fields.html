    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which causes DNA hypomethylation (very reduced DNA methylation) by inhibiting DNA Methyltransferases (so, specifically, Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor, or DNMTi). By preventing DNA methylation during cell division, a possible way for Decitabine to have an anti-tumor effect is by preventing the methylation of CpG islands in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes in the daughter cells, and so preventing those genes from being silenced. The active tumor suppressor genes can then help to prevent the formation or spread of tumors from the daughter cells of cells which which may have become cancerous by having their tumor suppressor genes silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands tend to be in the promotors of genes, and so when they become hypermethylated, the gene is silenced. While a small subset of genes may be silenced by dynamic CpG island hypermethylation, in general CpG islands in promotors tend to be protected from methylation. However, in various cancers, we find that CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes and similar become hypermethylated, silencing such genes, and so stopping them from preventing the out-of-control cell division. Which genes get silenced varies with different cancer types. <br /><br />In intergenic regions and in repetitive elements, sequences rich in CpG tend to be hypermethylated. This tends to increase genome stability, by reducing both transpositions and incorrectly matched crossovers (by silencing the repetitive elements that allow, and are the result of, such things). Also, methylation in the intergenic regions may serve to silence cryptic promotors and criptic splice sites, which if unmethylated can interfere with proper gene expression of nearby genes. In many cancers, we find that these sites often end up hypomethylated, thus increasing genome instability and possibly unsilencing previously silenced oncogenes or interfering with proper expression of tumor suppressors. Increased Transpositions may lead to changing expression levels of proto-oncogenes and onco-genes by inserting them near more active promotors. Etc. Any of these effects or many of them combined could lead to the out-of-control cell division of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) to which the insulator protein CTCF can bind, is hypermethylated. This has two effects: 1.) it prevents CTCF from binding, and thus allows downstream enhancers to increase Igf2 expression. 2.) this hypermethylation spreads to the promotor of H19, thus preventing its expression. So, in the paternal allele, Igf2 expression is increased, while H19 expression is decreased.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the maternal allele of this cluster, neither the ICR nor the promotor for H19 are methylated. This has two effects opposite to the paternal allele: 1.) CTCF can now bind to the ICR, and it insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, reducing or stopping its expression. 2.) with an unmethylated promotor, downstream enhancers instead increase H19 expression which is no longer silenced.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's Tumor, imprinting of the maternal allele has been disrupted, and so shows the same methylation pattern as the paternal allele. The effect of this imprinting disruption on this particular cluster is over-expression of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promotor, so over-expression leads to too much cell division. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in the patterns of DNA methylation should be inherited by any daughter cells of the changed cells. Thus any changes to patterns of DNA methylation due to drug treatments will continue on after the end of the treatment period.</p>
<p>A "sensitive period" is a period during development when cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. These tend to be during the time period between fertilization and the blastocyst stage, as the cells of the zygote are set to be pluripotent, and during the time period of primordial germ cell development and gametogenesis.</p>
<p>As epigenetic marks play a large role in cell growth and differentiation during development, disruption to reprogramming of these marks during sensitive periods could have catastrophic and even fatal effects on a developing embryo. Therefore such drug treatments during these times would be very inadvisable, unless there is no other way to save the patient. . </p></div>
