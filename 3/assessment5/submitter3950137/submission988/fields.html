    <h1>Submission 988 from Anon (session_user_id: 41f54accb1817ffa85fa8cd48e7d0b4cdd585d95)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark that is passed on to successive generations. There are two waves of epigenetic reprogramming that affect the genome. One sensitive period is the early embryonic period is when parental genomes undergo demethylation , epigenetic marks are then established in a lineage fashion. Another sensitive period is at the primordial germ cell stage where there is differential resetting in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can last beyond period of drug treatment due to the fact that the epigenetic alterations attributed to these drugs are mitotically heritable until such time that these altered marks are removed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Epigenetic drugs are now used in a wide array of cancers and there has been proven efficacy. However there is a lack of information in regard to the long term effects of these drugs on cells, the mechanisms of actions of these drugs is still unclear. This could have ramifications in regard to patients that are young or are pregnant as alterations or removal of normal epigenetic processes during these sensitive periods  could result in disruption of the epigenome causing aberrant genetic expression. </strong></p>

    <div class="field-value"><p><strong><em>DNA methylation occurs at CpG nucleotides and is associated with maintaining genomic integrity .It is widely thought to protect the genome from transposable elements. DNA methylation occurs at repeats and  intergenic regions. CpG islands on the other hand are normally methylation free despite the fact that they have a high CpG nucleotide density.  </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, in cancer these CpG islands become hypermethylated, silencing the underlying gene. </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is an epimutation and is mitotically heritable and is effective in locking in the silent state of  tumor suppessor genes. Cells with these epimutations are rapidly selected and divide more frequently over time and are not as frequently subjected to apoptosis (cell death) as other cells. These cells have a competitive advantage over cells in surrounding tissues promoting tumorgenesis. CpG island hypermethylation is associated with clinically distinct tumors.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally heavily methylated and thus heterochromatized  this in turn preserves genomic integrity.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated , these areas represent quite vast areas of the genome. When repeats are hypomethylated they  are not so densely packaged down, so misalignment can occur leading to illegitimate recombinations and abnormal karyotypes. Unmethylated repeats are free to make a copy of themselves and jump around the genome disrupting coding regions of the gene and affecting neighbouring genes.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Less common is the hypomethylation of intergenic regions. These regions are CpG poor promoters: however when unmethylated can lead to activation of oncogenes for eg the R-Ras oncogene in gastric cancer.  This chromosomal instability enhances tumorgenesis contributing  to cancer. It is interesting to note that this genome wide hypomethylation occurs in most tumor types and was  historically the first epigenetic abnormality found in cancer. </em></strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong><em>Genomic imprinting can be described as allele specific expression based on the parent of origin.  In the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region is methylated blocking the binding of CTCF this in turn silences the H19 gene . At this stage the enhancers are free to access the Igf2 gene to activate expression. The paternal allele is has a methylated ICR so paternally imprinted.  </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated with the CTCF binding to sites within the ICR. This binding ensures insulation of Igf2 from accessing shared enhancers near the H19 region repressing Igf2 gene . The enhancers are able to access and activate the H19 gene.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Altered DNA methylation patterns at ICR’s can result in repression and or over expression of growth promoting genes. This particularly true in the case of Wilm’s tumor , overexpression of growth factor Igf2 can lead to tumorgenesis. In this case there an imprinting disruption that doesn’t allow for monoallelic parent of origin specific expression. The Igf2 gene is expressed from both parental alleles due to the hypermethylation pattern of the ICR in the H19/Igf2 cluster. This is a common early event seen in tumorgenesis.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong><em> Certain cancers show aberrant hypermethylation, this over activity of methylates silences tumor suppressor genes. </em></strong><strong><em>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs that act as DNA-demethylating agents or DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi), they target the epigenetic machinery in particular mutations of epigenetic regulators. The effect of these molecule inhibitors is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth by demethylation of overactive methylation sites.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> DNMTi inhibitors are nucleoside analogues that bind to DNMT after it is incorporated into DNA, it is replication dependant and cancer cells are affected as they replicate at a faster rate.  These drugs are effective in treating myelodysplastic syndromes and haemotogical malignancies as these malignancies are dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. It is important to note that these drugs are most effective when given in lower doses, in higher doses they become toxic and non specific.</em></strong></p>
