    <h1>Submission 135 from Anon (session_user_id: b9335acd7f5903ca3ba4404569ad01217c3f20ec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in 60% of promoters and are not methylated in normal cells. However, CpG islands are hypermethylated in cancer cells,  which silences the underlying genes. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumor supresser genes leads to cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regoins and repetitive elements are considered to<span> repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing</span>. In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated.Hypomethylation of repetitive elements results in genomic instability by causing reciprocal translocation. Hypomethylation also occurs at CpG poor promoters. Genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of repeats contributes to cancer for the most part.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele H19 promoter is methylated, which results in Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele H19 promoter is not methylated, which inhibits Igf2 expression. In Wilm's tumor, both the paternal and maternal alleles have methylated H19 promoter, which results in over expression of Igf2 .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor and used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML. Decitabine irreversibly binds to DNA after incorporated to DNA, therefore, the drug works best in cells of active DNA replication. The mechanism of action of Decitabine is still unclear, although we know that the drug has no specificity. At high doses Decitabine affect bothnormal and cancer cells while at  relatively low doses the drug affects cancer cells without side effects. This is probably due to the fact that cancer cells have more DNA replications than normal cells, and thus incorporate more Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inheritable mitotically inheritable. Therefore, treatment with DNA methylation altering drugs during early embryonic stages is not advisable because the treatment can affect all kinds of tissues. Such treatment should not be performed during germ cell development either, when the reprogramming of epigenome happens during meiosis. Both the early embryonic stages and germ cell development are called the sensitive stages because drug treatment at such periods affects DNA methylation of the various tissues of the patients.</p></div>
