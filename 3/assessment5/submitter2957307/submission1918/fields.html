    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells, CpG islands tend to have little DNA methylation. However, in cancer cells, DNA methylation is used as a silencing mechanism, to prevent the expression of tumour-suppressing genes. The increase in DNA methylation at CpG islands then cause a rapid selection of epimutations. Because methylation is mitotically heritable, these epimutations can then be passed down to subsequent cells. On the contrary, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally heavily methylation to maintain genomic stability and prevent mutations. But in cancer, these regions are hypomethylated, resulting in a greater amount of transposing elements and recombinations (deletions, insertions, translocations, etc.) Thus, genomic instability becomes more prevalent. In addition to being a feature of cancer, genomic instability caused by disruption of methylation at noncoding regions is also a main characteristic of numerous diseases such as ICF syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at an imprinted control region (ICR), which in turn renders the CTCF insulator protein unable to bind there. The lack of an insulator protein causes methylation to spread downstream to the promoter of the H19 gene, silencing it and allowing enhancers to access the lgf2 cluster upstream, resulting in its expression. The maternal allele, on the other hand, is not methylated at the ICR, allowing the CTCF protein to bind there. This protein then insulates the lgf2 cluster from enhancers, which results in no expression. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele behaves like a paternal allele. This unusual behavior leads to an increase in the expression of lgf2, a known oncogene and growth promoter. With two copies of an active lgf2 gene, cell growth continues unboundedly, resulting in tumours and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, which means it focuses on the demethylation of CpG islands. The hypermethylation of CpG islands occur frequently in various types of tumours. By decreasing the hypermethylated CpG islands in cancer cells, expression of previously suppressed tumour-suppressor genes will increase and thus have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, which means a mother cell is able to pass her epigenetic marks to her daughter cells, who will then pass the marks to their daughter cells, and so on. It would be unwise to treat patients with epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods, which are times where epigenetic marks are cleared and reset. Two such periods are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development. This treatment would not be adivised because the drugs can heavily and negatively influence the reprogramming of epigenetic marks, especially DNA methylation. By altering DNA methylation, patients will be more susceptible to genomic instability and mutations. Such effects are highly dangerous and likely to be long-lasting.</p></div>
