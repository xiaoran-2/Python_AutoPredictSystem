    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer the amount of methylation could change in two different ways, locus specific DNA hypermethylation or genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. So this changes in the epigenetics marks could lead a normal cell became in a cancer cell. </p>
<p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-71e42b6e12d474f781199b2d/970238/asst-5/970238-520e648e7e5a54.86649602.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is silencing of gene expression. The CpG island uses to be hypomethylated in a normal cell.</p>
<p>Cancer produces a hypermethylation in the CpG islands. So it produces silence of tumour suppressor genes. This epimutations are rapidly selected, mitotically heritable and reversible (unlike DNA mutations). The CpG islands methylation progresses with time, so the level of methylation can be useful in diagnosis. </p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements use to be hypermethylation in a normal cell but in a cancer cell are hypomethylated. In a normal cell the hypermethylation is helpful to genomic stability, . In a cancer cell the hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements produce genomic instability (deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations). The consequence is illegitimate recombination between repeats. In a normal cell this recombination between repets wouldn´t happen because the repeats are heavily methylated and also they be heterochromatonized. In the cancer cell the hypomethylatation "open" the genome in euchromatin so it can occur illegitimate recombinations. Besides can occur activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a epigenetic inhibitors who belongs to the class of <span>DNA-demethylating agents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> It reduces the number of methylation in the histone. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In some cancer the <span>enzyme called EZH2 is overactive. <span>This enzyme attaches methyl groups to histone proteins. The<span> overactivity produce hypermethylation in the histones and thus silences the genes they surround. When in the neighbor genes are<span> tumour-suppressor genes, they can´t stop the <span>uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer because they are being silenced.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is a analogue of cytidine. In high dose is toxic but it in low dose can produce DNA demethylation. The way of acting is  binding irreversibly to the DNA methyl transferasa (DNTM). So it can reduce the histone overmethylation and avoid the silence in the tumour-suppressor genes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In some genes the pattern of methylation is different in the maternal and the paternal allele. This produces that it will be expressed in one parent and silencing in the other parent. The changes in the pattern of methylation can produce cancer because gene will be expressed or silencing in both allele in the same way. So the cell will have double dose or silence in both allele. A example  is the H19/Igf2 cluster:<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-71e42b6e12d474f781199b2d/970238/asst-5/970238-520e6460801287.38162895.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The imprintig control region (ICR) in the maternal allele is unmethylated. CTCF 4 binds to ICR and acts like a insulator element. So in this case the enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent</p>
<p>The ICR in the paternal allele is methylated. CTCF can´t bind to ICR so the enhancers will act on Igf2 instead in H19 like in the maternal allele. So Igf2 will be expressed.</p>
<p>In the Wilm´s tumour both alleles are methylated. So Igf2 will be expressed in the maternal and paternal allele. The Igf2 is a growth promoting, and this double dose is associate with Wilm´s tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This kind of treatment with epigenetic drugs can´t be use in young patients because the effects on the germ cells. And in pregnant women.</p>
<p>The changes on DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. So the alterations in DNA methylation can have enduring effects.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is when the epigenetics mark are actively remodeled. So the enviroment may be able to influence in the epigenetic makeup </p>
<p>The sensitive periods are:</p>
<p>The primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperm.</p>
<p>The preimplantation and early postimplantation periods.</p>
<p>The effect of the epigenetic drugs could change the epigenetic makeup of the normal cells. Also could affect to the epigenetic in the gametes so the offspring could have problems due the treatment in the parent.</p>
