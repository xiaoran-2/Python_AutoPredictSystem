    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are normally unmethylated, whereas in cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated. In normal function, unmethylated CpG islands allow tumour supressor genes to protect the cell from becoming hyperplasic and/or neoplasic. However, when CpG island hypermethylation occurs, tumour supressor genes are silenced, which leads to disease. Tumours, relatively to others, show different hypermethylated CpG islands. This characteristic has been associated with gliomas, neuroblastomas, colorectal cancer and others. Furthermore, as the tumour grows, hypermethylation in CpG islands increases. Such clinically distinct features suggest that it might be useful to target epigenetic alternations with pharmacotherapy and/or chemotherapy.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions are quite the opposite of that in CpG islands, both in normal and pathological conditions. In normal conditions, intergenic regions are methylated, which guarantees genomic stability and supression of oncogene activity. In cancer, however, intergenic regions are hypomethylated, which leads to disease through the illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Evidence of intergenic hypomethylation leading to disease is demonstrated in mouse models. Hypomethylation caused by deletion of Dnmt1 in specific tissue leads to genomic instability, which results in the mouse dying in uterus. In humans, mutations in DNMT3B causes ICF syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele of a normal cell, Igf2 expression is activated due to H19 methylation, which allows the enhancers to act on Igf2. Also, DMR is not binded to any transcriptional receptors. In contrast, Igf2 expression is inactive in the maternal allele, since H19 is unmethylated, thus not allowing the enhancers to promote Igf2 expression. Also, DMR is binded to the transcriptional repressor CTCF in the maternal allele. In other words, Igf2 expression is active in the paternal allele due to H19 methylation, whereas Igf2 expression is inactive in the maternal allele due to H19 being unmethylated.</p>
<p>Disruption in imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to disease. A textbook example of this is Wilm's tumour. In this pathological condition, H19 in the maternal allele is also methylated, which causes the Igf2 from both the maternal and paternal allele to be expressed. This leads to illegitimate and unregulated cellular growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;

        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a drug that has shown promising results in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, is an epigenetic inhibitor that belongs to the class of methyltransferase inhibitors. It's mechanism of action consists in the inhibition of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. In other words, Decitabine works as a hypomethylating agent, blocking DNA methylation by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </p>
<p>This can have an anti-tumour effect by allowing tumour-suppressor genes to be expressed. Intuitively, if tumour-supressor genes are inhibited by hypermethylation, hyperplasia and neoplasia might occur. Hypermethylation can be reversed by using the hypomethylating agent Decitabine, allowing tumour-suppressor genes to be expressed and thus resulting in anti-tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation, such Decitabine and Azacytidine, have lasting effects due to the fact that alterations in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. In other words, alterations in DNA methylation are inherited by the daughter cell after mitosis occurs. Similarly, granddaughter cells will also inherit the alterations and the generations of cells will keep passing on the alteration until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>Although drugs that alter epigenetic functions, such as hypomethylating agents, have shown promising results, their use should be avoided in sensitive periods. General consent among scientists is that early life constitutes a period during which sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms is increased. Several studies have shown that environmental factors during sensitive periods of development (gastrula, first ten days of life, etc.) can program genes through DNA methylation. If hypomethylating agents were to be used in sensitive periods, the epigenetic machinery would not be able to use DNA methylation to program genes, in accordance to environmental factors. This could lead to several cognitive and psychiatric disorders.</p>
