    <h1>Submission 147 from Anon (session_user_id: a5371d8daf0aa59b07846b64e96e8d2638d77a31)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demetylation agent called as DNMTi . Its an epigenetic drug marketed by Eisai ,a japanese company. It is used in treatment of mylodysplastic syndrome which is a precursor to mylogenous leukamia. Decitabine is an  epigeneti inhibitor which decreases hypermethylation of histones. Overmethylated histones silences a tumour supressor gene surrounding itself. The net result is unregulated growth of cancer cells. Since the process is epigenetic becuase of overmethylation of Histone proteins it is possible to address it with drug intervention. Precisely, thats what the drug Decitabine does by reducing overmethylation of histones. There is a direct result of downregulating tumour cells by activating tumour suppressor gene which under the impact of histone overmethylation was silenced . One can say it is a methyl regulator and By reversing gene silencing it restores the tumour suppressor gene expression.These treatment helps in penetrating solid tumours .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenomes are mitotically heritable and hence epigenetic mistakes are passed on to next generation.The specifc gene or panel of genes which are identified as epigenetically altered for instance the hypermethylated  CpG island  are known as biomarkers. Hypermethylated CpGs cause tmour supressor genes to be silenced leading to unabated growth of cells. Such  biomarkes are  identified and targeted for treatment . DNA over methylation when treated activates gene expression of tumour supressor.The epigenetic modifiers can be reprogrammed and erased and once the inhibitors have supressed the tumour cells it subsequently Replicates into healthydaughter as well as granddaughter  cells . DNMTi and HDACs work on genomewide cells and also regulates normal cells. During sensitive period which is the pre embryonic stage and PGC stage methylation is not maintained in maternal, paternal  allele and to an extent in imprinted alleles.. In young patients inhibitors can have an impact on primordial germ cells  development and can damage the epigenome of germcells . In natural course the during PGC there is  epigenetic resetting to enable healthy  formation  of sperms and oocyte as the case maybe.Targeted treatment on hypermethylation during such sensitive period prevents this resetting and can cause epimutagenic alteration in germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that imprinting control is important in gene dosage control . Just like X inactivation ICR help in regulating gene expression by either silencing maternal allele or paternal allele. In case of H19/Igf 2 cluster there is paternal imprinting in normal cells and maternal allele is silenced.  Paternal allele is imprinted by methylation at ICR which doesnot allow CTCF binder protein to attach to itself. As a result the distant  enhancers are directly able to work upon the allele on the other side enabling expression Of lgf2 and silencing paternal H 19. Thats in normal paternal cluster. In the maternal cluster the ICR is not methylated and hence CTCF  binds to it blocking enhancers from expressing lgf2 .  The enhancers work upon directly on H19 gene which is nearby. Thus only paternal is expressed and materrnal is silenced.</p>
<p>In case of diseased cancer cells this process is disrupted. The paternal expression is expressed as in normal cell but the maternal ICR is also methylated and works like a duplcate copy of paternal side. Thus Igf2 is expressed in maternal allele too and H19 is silenced unlike the normal cell. It results in double dosage / expression of Igf2 which is growth promoting gene leading to Wilms tumour. It occurs in kidney at a very young age </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the CpG island is unmethylated whereas the intergenic regions as well as repetetive elements are methylated. In case of cancer cells the CpG island is heavily methylated whereas the intergenic regions are unmethylated. There is a correlation with hypermethylation of CpG island and silencing of tumour suppressor gene.  The latter is a growth restrictor and when it is silenced there is unregulated growth of cells building up a tumour. </p>
<p>CpG island of a gene or a group of genes known as CIMP when methylated cause Tumour supressor cancer . They are tumour specific and behave clinically different for gender, age and type of tumour. As methylation increases over time in CpGs it leads to hyperplasia and subsequently neoplasia marked by increased cell growth than a normal cell. When the gene is overmethylated over time  it leads to metastasis which is a malignant tumour. One knows that cancer is caused by activation of oncogene or silencing of tumour suppressor gene. In case of hypermethylation it leads to silencing of tumour suppressor. BRCA1  is    CpG hypermethylation led tumour supressor cancer.</p>
<p>The function of methylation in normal cells where the repeats and intergenic regions are methylated is to impart genome stability. Methylated repeats are stable and cannot distrupt the genome. In case of hypomethylation the unmethylated repeats cause genomic instability by illegitimate Recombinations And transcriptional errors.</p>
<p>The repeats float around and cause activation of cryptic promoters of neighbouring genes or insertion or deletions in intergenic region. Chromosomal instability by depletion of methyl ( hypo) in DNMT2 B is the cause of cancer such as ICF sYndrome.</p>
<p>Activation of oncogenes by poor CpGs  is another variation of hypomethylation of sparse CpGs and intergenic regions including repeats. It activates glioma by targeting PTEN a tumour supressor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="float:none;">In case of H19/Igf2 cluster it is well established  that methylation of maternal allele lead to double expression of lgf2 leading to Wilms tumour. This is an example of cancer by imprint control disruption.</span></p></div>
