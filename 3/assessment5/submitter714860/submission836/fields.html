    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation silences gene expression and occurs almost exclusively at the promoters of genes, where CpG nucleotides occur.  Most CpG islands are unmethylated, but a small subset are methylated.  This DNA methylation causes X inactivation in the female mammal, and is instrumental in imprinting and in the formation of heterochromatin. </p>
<p> In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation maintains genomic stability by silencing repeats and preventing gain or loss of chromosomes, and/or illegitimate combinations of chromosomes.  Unlike CpG islands at the promoters of genes, intergenic intervals and repetitive elements in the genome are usually methylated.  This maintains genomic integrity by silencing cryptic transcription start sites in repeats or cryptic splice sites in the intergenic intervals.  This also avoids transcriptional interference from strong promoters within the repeats.  In fact, the Genome Defense model states that the primary function of DNA methylation is to protect the genome from transposable elements.</p>
<p> All cancers have aberrant DNA methylation.  In cancer, changes in DNA methylation lead to hypermethylation (silencing) of tumor supressor genes and genome-wide hypomethylation. Since the majority of the genome consists of intergenic and repetitive elements which are normally methylated, the result of this loss of methylation is genomic instability as detailed above.  Tumor suppressor genes become hypermethylated, and therefore inactive, and genes that promote growth become unmethylated, therefore constantly active.  Genes that repair DNA and initiate cell death become hypermethylated and inactive. No one is minding the store and the barbarians are at the gates. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the monoallelic expression of a gene based on the parent-of-origin of the allele.  Imprinted genes occur in clusters, and their expression is controlled by the Imprint Control Region (ICR).</p>
<p>In the H19/Ig2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the PATERNAL allele, and this methylation spreads downstream to silence the lncRNA H19.  Enhancers downstream bypass H19 and act on IgF2 and cause it to express.</p>
<p>On the MATERNAL allele in the same cluster, the ICR is UN-methylated and shielded by the insulator protein CTCF.  H19 is also UN-methylated, and the upstream enhancers act on H19 and cause it to express.  This is a growth-inhibiting event.</p>
<p>The maternal and paternal alleles are imprinted in this way to avoid either uncontrolled growth or no growth.  When their mechanisms are disrupted, the balance is upset in favor of growth, and the result is disease.</p>
<p>For example,in Wilm's tumor, CTCF is absent,and  the ICR is vulnerable to methylation, which spreads downstream and silences H19.  The configuration of the maternal cluster is now the same as the paternal cluster and there is a double dose of IgF growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent which acts as a DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor.  It is approved for myelopoastic syndrome which has progressed to AML. </p>
<p>Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analog, incorporating itself into DNA upon replication.    Normally in DNA replication, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) copies methylation to the daughter strand, and is then released.  When Decitibine is present, DNMT is bound irreversibly, and cannot be released.  Therefore, less available DNMT dials down the process of methylation.  This process is division-dependent, and cancer cells, which replicate more quickly than normal cells, are more vulnerable to the effect.  The effect of deleting DNMT1 is context dependent, and can either enhance or inhibit tumorigenesis.  If the tumor is the result of tumor-suppressor hypermethylation, the tumor will be suppressed.  If chromosomal instability is causing the tumor, less DNA methylation will cause the tumor to grow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  Somatic cells make their choice of DNA methylation as individuals, and the choice is normally maintained throughout the life of the organism.  That’s why a liver cell doesn’t change into a skin cell.  Dr. Baylin states: “…epigenetic changes [such as DNA methylation] are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.  Once erased, though, they do not return.”  Changes to DNA methylation occuring as a result of chemotherapy will last through generations of cells for the life of the individual.</p>
<p> A sensitive period would be any period of cell reprogramming e.g.: during early development and formation of the gametes, Interfering with DNA methylation at these times could result in loss of imprinting and interfere with X inactivation in females, or produce mutations in somatic cells.  Since germ cells are not completely formed in humans until the age of 8 or 9,  interfering with DNA methylation in children before this age could also impact adult fertility or cause mutations in the germ cells leading to birth defects in the next generation.</p></div>
