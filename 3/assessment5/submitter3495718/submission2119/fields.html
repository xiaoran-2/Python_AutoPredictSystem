    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic silencing mark. Typically, when CpG islands (CGIs) are methylated, proteins such as MeCP1/2 are able to bind and heavily heterochromatinize the region, in addition to blocking transcription factors. These proteins can serve as binding sites for other proteins which further compact the heterochromatin. This often occurs at promoters, silencing entire genes. CGIs are not often methylated, and when they are, the effect is always to silence the locus. Integenic regions and repeats are typically methylated, by contrast. The effect is to prevent transcription from beginning inappropriately at those loci and to prevent transposition and splicing in those regions. Without such non-CGI methylation, the genome is highly unstable, even at the karyotypic level.</p>
<p>Disease is associated with the failure of either one of these mechanisms. CGI hypermethylation can silence needed genes, while CGI hypomethylation can activate genes inappropriately. For example, Angelman syndrome can be caused by hypomethylation of the PWS-IC, which controls imprinting in UBE3A. The genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of intergenic and repeat regions can have severe impact on health; in particular, cancers form much more easily. Additionally, genomic and epigenomic instability promote one another, accelerating major changes in the genome.</p>
<p>In cancers, both mechanisms typically fail. CGIs are generally hypermethylated, while the genome as a whole is hypomethylated. CGI hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes, which in turn promotes tumorigenesis. Where CGIs are hypomethylated instead, oncogenes can be activated, with the same effect. Meanwhile, hypomethylation of intergenic causes severe genomic instability. Instability can have a severe effect on prognosis in any context; in cancer, in particular, a population of neoplastic or cancerous cells can respond very rapidly to selective pressures, which any treatment necessarily constitutes. This sort of evolution paves the way for more aggressive, treatment-resistant cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Tumorigenesis can be caused by the activation or over-expression of oncogenes, which can happen by a failure of imprinting. One example is the development of Wilm's tumor, particularly in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor is associated with overexpression of Igf2 due to an imprinting failure. Typically, the H19/Igf2 clusters inherited from each parent will display different methylation: the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, while the maternal allele is not. The insulator CTCF binds to the maternal allele near the Igf2 gene, so downstream enhancers will not access Igf2 to promote its expression. The H19 promoter is nearer and euchromatinized, so the enhancers preferentially promote H19 expression. CTCF cannot bind to the methylated paternal allele, and since the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, nothing stands between the enhancers and Igf2. Thus normal expression proceeds, from one copy of the gene.</p>
<p>But if both alleles received have paternal methylation, then Igf2 will be expressed from both alleles; in the zygote, this will cause Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. More generally, the loss of imprinting can take place at any time. Since Igf2 is an oncogene, the patient is at elevated risk of cancers like Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancers are characterized by epigenetic mutations as well as genetic mutations. Just as the damaged genome of a cancer cell must propagate to its daughters in order for a tumor to form, so must it be accompanied by the altered epigenome. The epigenetic changes that are seen in cancers are often crucial to tumorigenesis: without them, oncogenes would not typically be activated, nor tumor suppressors silenced.</p>
<p>Therefore, one therapeutic option is to disrupt the propagation of damaged epigenomes in cancer cells. Abnormal silencing depends on DNA methylation, and mitotic heritability of methylation in any cell requires DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins. Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor, so it reduces the effectiveness of DNMT, such that methylation is not copied during mitosis. Extant cells are unaffected, but their methylation rapidly dilutes in their progeny. Happily, experiment demonstrates that cancer cells are disproportionately affected, but the mechanism is poorly understood.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An agent that alters a cell's genome obviously has similar effects on its daughter cells. The same is true of many epigenetic marks. In particular, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable — so any changes made to a cell's DNA methylation will be copied and passed to its progeny.</p>
<p>But epigenetic drugs are typically non-specific, so their use can have detrimental effects on methylation in healthy cells and their progeny. This contraindicates epigenetic drugs in certain situations. In particular, there are moments in development, known as sensitive periods, in which the epigenetic state is critical and sensitive to disruption; using epigenetic drugs during a sensitive period can have serious effects on the organism or its progeny.</p>
<p>The most obviously sensitive period is that of the epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in a developing organism between the zygote, blastocyst, and epiblast stages. In this period, DNA is almost completely demethylated, and differential methylation of parental contributions forms the basis for imprinting. Any interruption is likely to have a detrimental effect on the process, contraindicating epigenetic drugs in early pregnancy. Similarly, DNA is demethylated during gamete development in children, and interruption with epigenetic drugs could affect the epigenetic state of their progeny.</p></div>
