    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal non cancerous cell CpG islands are generally hypomethylated. This allows for an open chromatin structure where transcription machinery can freely bind to the promoters of genes, resulting in the normal transcription and expression of the gene. In a cancerous cell hypermethylation of many CGI's is found.This hypermethylation results in the formation of heterochromatin (via MeCP proteins) at the promoter - effectively silencing the expression of the gene. The identity of the hypermethylated CGI's varies by tumour type but it is most likely to be found in tumour suppressor genes. It is recognised that CGI methylation is one of the 'hits' that contribute to the onset of cancer (Knudson hypothesis) via the silencing of the tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In contrast to CGI hypermethylation in cancer, the intergenic regions and repetetive elements are subject to genome wide hypomethylation during tumorogenesis. Normally these regions would be heavily methylated and have a compact chromatin structure to ensure genomic stability. Without appropriate methylation at intergenic regions mutations may occur resulting in deletions, translocations, insertions and transcriptional interference. Similarly, methylation of repetetive elements is needed to silence the repeats and prevent transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. This genome wide hypomethylation occurs in all tumour types and progresses with tumorogenicity. Hypomethylation results in an open chromatin structure which allows repeats to become active and also may result in the activation of CpG poor promoters (in turn activating oncogenes) or activating microRNA's which target tumour suppressors (miR21).</p>
<p>The role of DNA methylation alterations in cancer is then context dependent. Some cancers are driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, some are driven by the genetic instability caused by genome-wide hypomethylation. In both cases it is found that these features occur in all cancers studied, more consistently even than genetic mutations.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene. It is part of the H19/Igf2 cluster on Chromosome 11q15.5. It is normally expressed on the paternal allele (imprinted) and silenced on the maternal allele thereby maintaining an appropriate level of expression of this gene.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated. This prevents CTCF (an insulating protein) from binding to it. The ICR methylation spreads downstream and silences H19 and the distal enhancers are free to activate the Igf2 gene. Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is non methylated. CTCF binds to it and has an insulating effect on Igf2 which prevents the enhancers from activating it. Igf2 is silenced. These enhancers instead activate the H19 LncRNA.</p>
<p>If the normal pattern of paternal imprinting on the H19/Igf2 cluster is altered either through mutation/deletion, paternal uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption this will cause both alleles to behave like the paternal allele resulting in a double dose of expression of the Igf2 gene. This occurs, along with silencing of the tumour suppressing gene Cdkn1c (part of the closely linked Kcnq1 cluster also on chromosome 11q15.5) in a condition called Wilm's tumour (kidney tumour). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigentetic inhibitors called DNA Methyl Transferase inhibitors or DNMTi's. They are approved for use in cases of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (progressed to AML). They are a nucleoside analogue which is incorporated into the DNA. At cell replication when DNMT1 comes to copy DNA methylation to the daughter cell it is irreversibly bound by the Decitabine (resulting in demethylation). The action of  Decitabine is division dependent, the cell has to be replicating... so cancer cells should be more susceptible to it as cancer cell replication occurs more rapidly than other cell types. However it is not known what the long term effects are on normal cells.</p>
<p>This drug seems to be most effective in Haematological malignancies since they are largely dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation. The effect of the drug would be to demethylate and therefore allow re-expression of these tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The mitotically heritable nature of DNA methylation patterns means that a drug which alters those patterns does so in an ongoing manner, genome wide. The change in DNA methylation caused by the drug will be copied during cell division. So there is the potential for negative mutagenic effects, long term, especially in cells other than the target cells.</p>
<p>A subject for special consideration when thinking about DNA methylation altering drugs is their potential effect on the epigenome during sensitive periods of development. These periods encompass pre and early post implantation development and also during the development of primordial germ cells and the maturation of gametes. These are periods of active reprogramming where epigenetic marks are removed and then re-established. During these times the cells are most susceptable to environmental assaults - that would include the effects of DNA methylation altering drugs.</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to attempt to concieve during or even for a period after using DNA methylation altering drugs. Any oocyte or spermatocyte undergoing gametogenesis in the presence of the drug would certainly suffer from its mutagenic effects and this would have serious repurcussions for fertility, embryonic viability and mutations/imprinting disorders in offspring. Treatment during pregnancy is contraindicated as the drug may effect the developing embryo during it's sensitive periods also.</p></div>
