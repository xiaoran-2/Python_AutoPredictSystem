    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Typically, CpG islands remain unmethylized in non-cancerous cells so that genes controlled by the corresponding promoter regions can be expressed normally. In cancerous cells however, CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylized repressing the expression of those genes and in so aiding tumor progression. </p>
<p>In contrast, in normal cells methylation of non-coding intergenetic regions prevent unspecific transcription through cryptic promoters and the expression of repeat elements and their transposition. Therefore, hypomethylation of these regions in cancer cells interferes with the correct expression and function of other genes such as tumor suppressor genes. Also, resulting changes in chromatin structure, from packed-away heterochromatin to more accessible unpacked chromatin, make it easier for ectopic recombination to occur resulting in further genomic instability. </p>
<p>Regardless of the epimutagenetic process, hyper- and hypomethylization, are efficiently passed down to new cell generations as they are maintained through mitosis and they are quickly positively selected as they promote multiplication and immortality of that cell lineage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a long non-coding DNA than when transcribed repressed the expression of the growth hormone Igf2. In turn, an imprinting control region (ICR) and the transcriptional repressor CTCF interact to regulate the expression of H19. When the ICR is not methylated, CTCF is able to bind to it prompting the transcription of H19 thus inhibiting the expression of Igf2. However, when the ICR is methylated, CTCF does not bind to it, H19 is inhibited and then Igf2 is expressed. This regulation occurs in <em>cis</em> so there no significant cross talk between maternal and parental copies of the cluster.</p>
<p>In healthy individuals, the parental inherited copy of H19's ICR is methylated whereas the maternal copy is unmethylated. As a result only the parental copy of Igf2 is expressed producing in regular levels of its protein product. However in some types of cancer including Wilm's tumors, the maternal ICR is also methylated thus resulting in a loss of normal imprinting of the Igf2/H19 cluster and doubling the amount of Igf2 growth factor produced. This in turn promotes cell growth which favor the development of the tumor and increases is pathogenicity.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent commercialized as Dacogen by Eisai. It inhibits DNA methyltransferases such as DNMT1 thus it results on progressive global hypomethylation of the genome as cell proliferation and multiplication through mitosis; methylation is not copied to the newly synthetized DNA strands. </p>
<p>Hypomethylation would erase methylation of CpG islands that resulted in the inhibition of tumor suppression genes and thus may bring under control or reverse the proliferation of those tumors that depend on some of the genes to be silenced to progress.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in the epigenome are efficiently pass down to daughter cells so any such change caused by a drug would have lasting effects well beyond drug treatment has concluded. That would be also the case for any genetic mutation that may have resulted from those epigenetic changes.</p>
<p>Despite that these drugs may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of certain cancers, their application may well result in unspecific changes in the epigenome that may have serious detrimental side effects. Therefore their application in actively diving healthy tissues should be avoided if possible. Specialy sensitive periods are those in where the individual is developing such as anytime before maturity but specially, gestation (so also apply to mothers during pregnancy), infancy and puberty.</p></div>
