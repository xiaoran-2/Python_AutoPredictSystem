    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CPG islands is usually used to silence genes. DNA methylation is also used to silence intergenic regions and repetitive elements, because these two regions are more prone to wrongfully recombine and transpose, which can affect transcription. In cancer, the CPG islands are methylated, while the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are demethylated. This does two things. It can silence tumour suppressor genes, which help prevent cancer growth. It also promotes genomic instablility by demethylating the intergenic region and repetitive elements, which can then be transposed and take part in unwanted recombination. With all of these increased risks for mutations, along with the silencing of tumour supressor genes and the increased levels of genomic instablilty, cancer is much easier to begin developing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal alles is methylated at the imprinting control region. This blocks a protein called CTCF from binding, which allows upstream enhancers to come bing to LGF2, thus activating LGF2.The maternal allele has a different set of characteristics.  CTCF binds to the maternal allele's imprinting control region, which means that LGF2 is not activated in the maternal allele. In cancer, due to genome wide hypermethylation, both the paternal and maternal allele's ICRs are methylated, thus allowing enhancers to bind to both LGF2s. This promotes twice as much growth, leading to the signature characteristic of cancer, which is unregulated cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibator, which has the overall effect of lowering methylation. The economist's article described Decitabine's anti-tumour effect by saying that it could reduce myelodysplastic syndromes, which reduces the chance that it develops into cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are many ways that altering DNA methylation could effect the epigenome. By lowering the levels of methylation at the CPG islands of tumour supressor genes, it could help restart the body's ability to fight cancer. There is also the possibility that by increasing methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, it could promote overall genomic stability and decrease the amount of genetic mutations. A sensitive period is a time when the genome is particularly vunerable to enviormental factors that could cause mutations. The two more important sensitive periods are during primordial germ cell development and early development. Treating patients during sensitive periods is dangerous, because this is the particular time when their bodies are easily affected by enviormental factors. Something as radical as altering genomic methylation could have disasterous effects on the genome during a sensitive period.</p></div>
