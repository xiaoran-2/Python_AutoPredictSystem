    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is considered as the best understood epigenetic modification, consisting on the addition of a methyl group in position 5’ of a Cytosine (5mC). It is characterized by being mitotically heritable (so, it will be transmitted to all daughter cells), but also reversible.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is takes place at CpG dinucleotides, due to symmetry and stability reasons. These CpG dinucleotides are commonly found in the so called CpG islands (regions of the genome with a high proportion of CpG dinucleotides), often found at promoter regions.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be unmethylated, while other regions, such as intergenic regions and repetitive elements, tend to have their CpGs methylated. This seems to be necessary for a correct transcription process, as DNA methylation at repeats and intergenic regions has been associated with an increased level of stability and silencing of cryptic transcription start or splicing sites, while DNA methylation at CpG islands has been associated with gene silencing.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, what has been found is a completely different phenotype, consisting on genome-wide hypomethylation (at repeats and intergenic regions), and hypermethylation of CpG islands of particular promoters (depending on each cancer), often promoters of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>This disruption of DNA methylation could lead to cancer by different paths: First of all, hypermethylation of CpG islands could alter chromatin structure, causing chromatin to acquire a more densely packed conformation. This conformation would be associated with gene silencing. In this case, it would result in a loss of function of the tumour suppressor.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unmethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions could lead to genomic instability (recombinations /deletions /insertions...), and impaired transcriptional function (e.g. activation and transposition of repeats). And if these changes affected proliferation genes or tumour suppressors it could easily end in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 / Igf2 is a cluster of two imprinted genes, which are controlled by an Imprint Control Region (ICR) located between them.</p>
<p>At the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, and this allows the binding of CTCF, a protein that covers the ICR and isolates the Igf2 gene from the interaction with downstream enhancers, which will act on the H19 gene. As a result, at the maternal allele, Igf2 expression is silenced (maternally imprinted gene), while H19 is actively transcribed.</p>
<p>At the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, and this prevents CTCF from binding the ICR, so downstream enhancers will interact with Igf2, which will be actively transcribed. At the same time, methylation at the ICR spreads to the H19 promoter, silencing its expression (paternally imprinted gene).</p>
<p>In Wilm’s Tumour (as part of the Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome), there is an imprinting disorder on this cluster, consisting in a maternal allele behaving like the paternal allele (Igf2 expression and H19 silencing), due to genetic mutations, paternal disomy, and less frequently, an epigenetic disruption,  associated with the loss of imprinting.</p>
<p>When Igf2 (a growth factor) is overexpressed (from both alleles), it can act as an oncogene, giving rise to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor), and it’s a DNA-hypomethylating agent, as it prevents DNA methylation from happening. It is currently used for some Myelodysplastic Syndromes.</p>
<p>DNMTi are nucleoside analogues, which bind irreversibly to DNMT enzymes when transcription is occurring.  However their molecular mechanism of action is still unknown and it seems that there is a lack of specificity on their action.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems that with low doses of Decitabine, DNA-demethylation is achieved, while with high doses of the drug, a nonspecific toxic effect seems to be the predominant effect.</p>
<p>So, Decitabine could have an anti-tumour effect directly, unmethylating tumour suppressor genes which were hypermethylated (silenced) in cancer cells, restoring the epigenetic marks present in normal cells; but also indirectly, changing the global epigenetic state of cancer cells (epigenome), and thus, altering its susceptibility to other chemotherapeutics.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation modify the epigenetic state of the cell (epigenome), and these epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so all daughter cells will have them, unless they were actively erased.</p>
<p>One of these changes could be related with tumour susceptibility to other chemotherapeutics.  In this way, drugs that target the epigenetic machinery could have a lasting effect on cancer cells, which will enhance the effect of other chemotherapeutics (cytotoxic chemotherapy).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these drugs shouldn’t be used at any time, since there are some sensitive periods in which modifications into the epigenetic state may cause unexpected and maybe irreversible side effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period comprises any time span in which the epigenetic state of an organism is being modified (e.g. epigenetic reprogramming), and then, any alteration on these modifications could disrupt the whole process. During development there are two major sensitive periods in which our organism is more susceptible: pre-implantation development (early embryo development) and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>So, treating patients with these drugs during sensitive periods (e.g. pregnant women), would be strongly unadvisable, as the treatment itself could impair the developmental process of the individual, altering its epigenome.</p></div>
