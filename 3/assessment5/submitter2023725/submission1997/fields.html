    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, methylation at CpG islands silences gene expression, and most CpG islands are protected from methylation. In cancer cells, methylation increases at CpG islands, which is a distinct contrast to methylation elsewhere in the cell, which decreases during cancer. For example, the normal methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is removed during cancer, causing hypomethylation of these regions.</p>
<p>The hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer occurs specifically at those CpG islands that are in the promoters of tumor suppresor genes. Thus, those genes are silenced, which allows the cancer to grow and not be suppressed. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can lead to loss of gene expression in genes that regulate growth and can lead to increases in gene expression for growth-promoting genes. This is particularly apparent in the disease Wilm's tumor, a childhood cancer tumor of the kidneys.</p>
<p>In the normal paternal allele, Igf2 is expressed because H19 is methylated, and therefore silenced. In the normal maternal allele, H19 is not methylated, which prevents the expression of Igf2. This leads, in normal cells, to only one copy (the paternal one) of Igf2 being expressed. When imprinting is disrupted in Wilm's tumor, the H19 gene gets methylated in the maternal allele in addition to being methylated in the paternal allele- so both alleles are methylated, and both alleles allow for the expression of Igf2. Therefore, you end up with an overabundance of Igf2. Igf2 is a growth promoter, so cells that overexpress it will grow more than normal, thus forming a tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, and it works by inhibiting DNMT1, thereby preventing methyl groups from being copied onto daughter strands of DNA during cell division. This could have an anti-tumor effect because DNA methylation of Cpg islands is common in cancer. So as this methylation on the Cpg islands stops being copied, these Cpg islands in the daughter cells become active. Once active, the Cpg islands would activate the tumor suppressor genes, which would produce tumor suppressor proteins that inhibit the activity of the cancer, thus treating the cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome because epigenetic signals, such as methyl groups on the gene, are passed down mitotically to daughter cells when the cell divides. As the treated cancer cell divides, its susceptibility to future chemotherapy is also passed down. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time period when epigenetic marks are being reset en masse on the genome. The two main periods of sensitivity are just after fertilization and during primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis). Treating a pregnant woman with drugs that alter methylation could disrupt the normal resetting of methylation patterns in the developing embryo or fetus, which could be fatal to the baby or cause birth defects or long-term health issues. Because these effects are passed down to daughter cells, every cell that develops later in the developing embryo or fetus would be affected.</p></div>
