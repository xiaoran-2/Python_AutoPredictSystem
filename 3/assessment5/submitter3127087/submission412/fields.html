    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (chemically 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine) is a drug used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes( a condition that involve ineffective production of myeloid class of blood cells).It is sold as Dacogen by Eisai. Decitabine is a hypomethylating (or DNA-demethylating) agent which can inhibit methylation. It acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.Many tumors are formed by the silencing of tumor suppressing genes due to hypermethylation. Normally these tumor suppressing genes prevents the formation of tumors by producing proteins which have a repressive effect on the regulation of cell cycle as well as promotion of apoptosis. When hypermethylated these genes are silenced. Decitabine can re-activate these tumor suppressing genes by preventing the enzyme DNA methyltransferase which is responsible for adding the methyl groups.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is biochemical process involving the addition of a methyl group at C5 position of cytosine.Generally DNA methylation is the basis for epigenetic phenomena like imprinting,X-inactivation etc.CpG sites are regions where Cytosine nucleotide is next to Guanine nucleotide.The CpG islands are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. These CpG islands are usually found in promoters. and are kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However in cancer cells promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated which then causes the silencing of the underlying gene. For example: Tumor suppressing genes are always expressed in a cell because the proteins they produce have a regulatory effect on cell cycle, they involve in DNA repair and also promote apoptosis. Due to hypermethylation of promoter CpG, these genes will be silenced and the cell will have impaired DNA repair mechanism which cannot edit mutations, absence of regulatory proteins will affect cell cyle as well as apoptosis and will lead to un-controlled cell division and there by cancer.The repetitive and intergenic regions are heavily methylated and heterochromatized to prevent it from illegitimate recombinations. Hypomethylation of this region will lead to euchromatization, misalignment and illegitimate recombination of regions that are not genetically identical which cause reciprocal translocations in chromosome and there by genomic instability. Also due to hypomethylation the repetitive elements are activated and they make copy of themselves and transpose. This cause disruption in coding region of a gene and also may activate neighbouring genes through cryptic promoters(eg:Avy and Axin genes in mouse) and even lead to transcriptional abberations. Deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations take place and result in genomic instability and ultimately cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is a genetic phenomenon by which certain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.Hypermethylation of most of the imprint control region lead to loss of imprinting which in turn leads to cancer. Normally Imprint control region(ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated in paternal allele due to which CTCF( a type of transcriptional repressor) will not bind on ICR and insulate it. Therefore the enhancers will act on the Igf2 gene and causes it's expression. Whereas the ICR region in maternal allele is unmethylated due to which CTCF can bind on it and insulate it.Therefore enhancers will act on H19 and the Igf2 remain silent and will not be expressed. Hypermethylation of ICR in H19/Igf2 cluster on both paternal and maternal allele cause loss of imprinting. The expression of Igf2 in both alleles will result in double dose of this growth promoting factor. Overexpression of Igf2 lead to Wilm's tumor which is a type of childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are preserved  when cells divide. ie they are mitotically heritable. DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic mechanism and an important regulator of gene expression. Altering of DNA methylation to rescue the cells from progressing to cancer with the help of drugs will have a lasting effect on the patient. This is due to the fact that these positively altered epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) are passed on during cell division.It can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. Senstive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming during which most epigenetic marks are actively cleared and reset. Primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development are two such sensitive periods. Treatment during sensitive periods is inadvisable because the positive alternation of DNA methylation by the drug can easily be cleared and reset as a part of epigenetic reprogramming.</p></div>
