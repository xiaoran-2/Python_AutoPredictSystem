In your answer include the following points:

    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA Methylation: is Symmetrical, so able to be maintained through cell division at CpG island, and it equals to silencing of gene expression, because methylated CpG in a CpG island is associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure (1st mechanism) and because meCpG can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression (2nd mechanism).
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>In cancer cell, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than normal cell.</li>
<li>In Cancer, DNA methylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes, which may lead to cancer. Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. Identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies by tumour type.</li>
</ul><ul><li>DNA methylation at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity and as a Genome defense model to protect it from the transposable elements.</li>
<li>In cancer, there is a Genome-wide hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, accompanied by genomic instability.</li>
<li>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation, which occurs to some degree in all tumour types tested, progresses with tumorigenicity, but the consequence of hypomethylation depends on location; at repetitive elements and Intergenic regions, it leads to genomic instability. This happens because hypomethylation Illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the paternal allele, there is DNA methylation imprint at ICR. This will blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate. Thus, Igf2is expressed from the pattern allele.</li>
<li>In the maternal allele, imprint control region is unmethylated. It is bound by a protein called CTCF, and CTCF is an insulator protein and it is able to insulate CTCF's binding insulate Igf2. Because it's insulating Igf2 these enhancers are now free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression on the maternal allele.</li>
<li>In <span><span>Wilm’s tumour, There is </span></span>high methylation of the imprint control region on the <span><span>maternal allele as well. </span></span>Now, on the maternal allele, there's an expression of Igf2, leads to a double dose of Igf2, which is growth promoting, and this is associated with Wilm's tumour.</li>
<li>Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele. usually there are mutation/ deletion to cause loss of imprinting or there is uniparental disomy, two copies of one parental chromosome, which leads to loss of Cdkn1c and overdose Igf2.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is </span>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Mechanism of action still unclear completely.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogs. So, it get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 comes along to bind it, in order to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is replication dependent. This explains why cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body, will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.</p>
<p>Decitabine should be taken at lower doses, to have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, in other words, to kill the tumor cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. </span>It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. That, indeed, appears to be what is happening in the case of GSK2816126. If it is, it would truly be a conceptual breakthrough, and epigenetics might justly take its place alongside genetics in the analysis and treatment of cancer.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming,it's a <span>period of development that is susceptible to environmental signals, eg. in vitro culture</span>. We know there are these two waves of reprogramming that occur: the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.</p>
<p>It's better to avoid <span>treating patients during sensitive periods with <span>epigenetic drugs</span>, for example </span>younger patients, particularly fetus and those that have developing germ cells for example in sensitive periods. Epigenetic drugs Lack of specificity to tumor cells inherent to their mechanism of action, which may have long term effects on normal cells as well. This may cause injury to the fast-deviding germ cells and can pass to progeny. They may harm the environment as well.</p>
