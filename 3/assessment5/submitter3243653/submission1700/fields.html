    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions in the genome that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. It is stated, that methylation of CpG in or near a promoter of a gene inhibits this gene expression. In normal cells methylation mostly occurs in the repetitive elements through intergenic regions, and CpG islands in promoters of genes are usually hypomethylated (besides the cases of parental imprinting). In cancer cells CpG islands of genes are methylated instead, silencing expression of these genes. If the gene, which was silenced this way, was a tumour suppressor gene for example, then turning off this gene may give rise to a cancer cell.</p>
<p>Another thing, which contributes to development of cancer, is hypomethylation of repetitive elements. It is well known, that one of the function of DNA methylation of this elements is to maintain genomic stability. Because these repeats are heavily methylated and moreover heterochromatonized in normal cells, recombination doesn’t occur. In cancer cells instead these repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which means, that this part of the genome becomes less densely packed, so recombination can happen, leading to disruption of coding region. Moreover, hypomethylated repeats have the ability to replicate themselves, which can result in consequent problems. They can jump into coding regions, disrupting it, or they can activate neighbouring genes. For example, they can activate a proto-oncogene.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, alteration in methylation pattern of CpG islands can result in overexpression of some genes (e.g. genes, responsible for cell proliferation and growth) or silencing of expression or disrupting the coding region of other genes (e.g. genes, responsible for programmed cell death). And also it can lead to translocations in case of hypomethylation of repetitive elements which in turn disrupt the coding regions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One examples of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer is H19/Igf2 cluster. It consists of two neighboured genes – Igf2 and H19, imprinted control region and enhancers. Methylation pattern of this cluster depends on origin of chromosome. On maternal chromosome ICR and H19 are unmethylated, meaning that an insulator protein called CTCF can bind to ICR, which in turn leads to expression of H19 and not Igf2, because enhancers in this case act only on H19. On paternal chromosome instead ICR and H19 are methylated, so CTCF can’t bind to ICR. Because of absence of insulator action of CTCF, enhancers are now free to act on Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour ICR on maternal chromosome is methylated like on paternal chromosome, causing inability of CTCF bind to ICR. This results in expression of not H19 gene, but Igf2 instead, so it is now expressed from both maternal and paternal chromosome, leading to overexpression of Igf2. And as Igf2 is growth promoting, overexpression of this gene can result in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the four FDA approved drugs, that affect epigenetic processes, is Decitabine. It belongs to a class of drugs, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase. Since Decitabine is nucleoside analog, it incorporates into the DNA during replication, and when DNMT comes to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it irreversibly binds to the drug. So all of a lump Decitabine hypomethylates DNA.</p>
<p>As is known, inhibition of expression of tumor suppressor genes, caused by methylation, is linked with formation of cancer cells. And this methylation is mitotically inheritable, so each daughter cell has these epigenetic marks. As Decitabine disrupt the process of copying methylation marks to the daughter strands of DNA, it allows tumor suppressor genes to be expressed again, as they are not methylated now.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known, that epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, so after proliferation each daughter cell will get the same marks, as the cell of origin. Epigenetic drugs like DNMT inhibitor Decitabine inhibits molecules or complexes, which are necessary for copying epigenetic marks to the descendant cells. As this marks, once cleaved, won’t appear again, then the effect, produced by epigenetic drugs will be maintained for a long period of time, making for example tumor cells of patients more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Of course, DNMT and all other complexes are needed not only for copying “bad” epigenetic marks, but all the marks, presented in the organism. And although cancer cells divide more often, than normal cells, the latter will be affected too, although long-term side effects is not well studied yet. That’s why it is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods, when epigenetic marks are cleared and reseted. Such sensitive periods are primordial development, germ cell development and early embryonic development. During this periods, as was mentioned above, the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occurs, so correct work of DNMT and others is essential for normal development.</p></div>
