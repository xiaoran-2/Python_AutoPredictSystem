    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated, in many types of cancer these islands become methylated. The effect of hypermethylated CpG islands depends on their location in the genome. One common effect is silencing of tumour supressor genes.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and the repetitive elements ate intstead often methylated in the normal cell and becomes hypomethylated in a cancer cell. The hypomethylation of these areas contribute to the genomic instability in cancerous cells.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contains an imprinting control region (ICR) that is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. This lets a trancription repressor known as CTCF bind to the ICR on the maternal allele. This blocks the downstream enhancers and inhibits the expression of the growth factor Igf2. Instead the enhancers work on the H19 gene. The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated and this allele expresses Igf2 instead of H19. In a Wilm's tumour both alleles are methylated, this lets the maternal allele express Igf2 as well. The double dose of growth factor helps the tumour survive and grow.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs calls DNMTi, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It works by inhibiting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. By inhibiting the enzyme the DNA of the daughtercells becomes hypomethylated. In many haematological magnancies the tumour supressor genes are hypermethylated. Allthough the mechanism of action for Decitabine is unknown a likely mechanism is that it blocks the hypermethylation of these tumour supressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylation state of a cell is inherited and passed on to its daughter cells. When the state is change by a drug or something else this change will be seen in both the cell itself and all its offspring. A sesitive period is a period where the epigenome is actively remodeled. This happens in primordial germcells untill they are complete gametes and around implantation of the fertilized egg. During these periods the cells are much more sensitive to enviromental influences and treatment in these periods may have big effects on future generations.</p></div>
