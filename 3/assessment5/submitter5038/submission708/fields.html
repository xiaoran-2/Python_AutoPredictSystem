    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;">Cancer can arise due to irregularities in epigenetic marks on the DNA.  These irregularities can be hypo or hypermethylation of DNA and also various modifications to histones.  If we focus on DNA methylation there are regions of DNA known as CpG islands where this effect is quite pronounced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">CpG Islands refer to regions of DNA that are rich in CpG sequences and about 60% of the time these regions can be found in areas of the genome that act as promoters for gene transciption. These regions are generally kept free of methylation which usually facilitates gene transcription. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">In many cancerous states the CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated.  The hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter region silences the underlying gene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">This is in contrast to stretches of DNA known as intergenic regions and repetitive elements. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">These regions tend to have hypermethylation in regions corresponding to highly expressed genes and is thought to minimize noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or control RNA splicing related to transcription timing. In cancerous states these regions show a high occurence of Hypomethylated Regions (HMRs).  </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Since the hypermethylation in these regions is related to the control of gene expression, hypomethylation leads to the runaway gene expression typical of cancer cells and tumorgenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">We can explore how the disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by focussing on the H19/Igf2 cluster as an example. The expression of this collection of genes is under the control of an imprinting control region (ICR).  The paternal allele is expressed because a nearby region containing an insulator is methylated.  A protein suppressor called CTCF can bind to this insulator region and turn off gene expression by de-activating nearby enhancers, but since this region is methylated in the male CTCF cannot bind and gene expression occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">The contrary occurs in the maternal variant of this ICR.  The insulator region is unmethylated thereby allowing the CTCF protein to bind.  This in turn disables the nearby enhancers from expressing the Igf2 gene (although another nearby gene - H19, is actually expressed as a result of this process).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Hypermethylation of the maternal allele at the insulator site causes increased expression of the Igf2 gene.  Since Igf2 is a growth factor it causes abnormal growth leading to tumors.</span></p>
<p>This site is extremely sensitive since both hypo and hyper-methylation of the normally imprinted sites can effect the expresssion of growth suppressing genes or increased expression of growth enhancing genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a class of epigenetic inhibitor that functions as a DNA de-methylating agent.  Therefore Decitabine generally functions by de-methylating regions of the DNA that have become methylated as a result of abberant cancerous methylation.  </p>
<p>Decitabine is related to a drug called azacitidine and both drugs have been empolyed in the treatment of myelogenous leukemia although some recent work has shown that the combination of azacitidine with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor has slowed tumor growth in lung cancer.  This indicates that they may bue used in the treatment of tumors, ostensibly due to the fact that they somehow increase the tumor's susceptability.  In addition, even when the tumor growth had not subsided, the patients responded more positively to subsequent chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This research was conducted on azacitidine, which is known to interact with both RNA and DNA, whereas Decitibine is restricted to DNA.  Further research is warranted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;">The epigenetic drugs that Dr. Baylin is describing are DNA de-methylating agents that would function by de-methylating regions of the DNA that had become methylated due to cancer.  In somatic cells this change would effectively become permanent as long as the altered cell line continued to divide through mitosis<strong>. </strong> </span></p>
<p>The mechanism for gene imprinting is such that established cells undergoing mitosis do not undergo significant changes in their methylation, but there are certain sensitive periods - when epigenetic marks are being established - where changes in the methylation pattern would be deleterious to the person. These periods would be when cells are undergoing meiosis, that this, the establishment of germ cells.</p>
<p>Therefore this type of treatment could adversely affect a persons ability to successfully procreate and that should be taken into consideration when deciding on a course of treatment.<br /><br /></p></div>
