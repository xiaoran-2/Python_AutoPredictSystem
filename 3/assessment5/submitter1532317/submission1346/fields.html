    <div class="field-value"><p>In somatic cells, about 70-80% of CpG (Cytosine Guanine joined covalently by phosphodiester bonds) are methylated.  However, CpG rich (&gt;50%) regions of 200-3000pb(2) (CpG islands) serve as about 60% of promoter regions.  CpG promoter regions are normally not methylated in somatic cells, but are hypermethylated in cancer. (1)  The degree of methylation is correlated positively to the degree of metastisis. (3) Areas surrounding CpG islands of about 2kb also show differences in methylation with respect to normal tissues. (1)</p>
<p>Methylation of CpG island promoters in cancer disrupts the normal pattern of gene transcription and silences tumor suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. (3,1) CpG island hypermethylation, or CIMP (for CpG island methylator phenotype) is found in specific patterns in retinoblastoma (RB) glioma (MGMT), colorectal (MLH1) and breast cancer (BRCA1) and is used as a sensitive, stable marker in diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. (1,3)</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. (3)  Regions of over half the genome show unpredictable methylation in cancer affecting genes that control cell division and nuclear organization. (1) Abnormal methylation causes lncRNA deregulation and disrupts the normal cell cycle, silences tumor suppressor genes (p53), and disrupts the apoptotic response to DNA damage (PANDA).(1)  Hyper and/or hypo methylation of ICR (imprint control regions) is also an early sign of cancer. (3)</p>
<p>Demethylation of repetitive elements causes genetic instability by deregulation of transposable elements and repeats. (3)  </p>
<p>Mitotically heritable methylations that cause abberant cell proliferation are selected in cancer. (3) Moreover, unpredictable methylation patterns contribute to tumor cell diversity and difficulty in treatment. (1)  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>

</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many imprinted genes are involved in growth.  Disruption of imprint control regions (ICRs), either by hyper or hypo methylation is an early sign of cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is composed of the Igf2 gene followed by the imprint control region (ICR) followed by the H19 gene followed by enhancers.  In normal cells, the ICR is methylated, blocking binding the transcriptional repressor CTCF.  The H19 gene is also silenced by methylation.  The absence of CTCF allows the enhancers to promote the transcription of Igf2 in the normal paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the normal maternal allele, the ICR and H19 gene are unmethylated.  CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, and blocks the action of the enhancers on the Igf2 gene.  The unmethylated H19 gene is transcribed.  As a result, Igf2 is transcribed from only the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICRs and H19 genes of both the paternal and maternal alelles are methylated.  Consequently, the enhancers act on the Igf2 genes of both alleles, transcribing double the dose of Igf2 in the cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth factor.  Overexpression of Igf2 is one of the factors that causes abnormal cellular proliferation in Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (sold as Dacogen) is a DNA demethylating agent. (1)  Decitabine is an altered form of one of the DNA bases, cytosine, that is incorporated into DNA during replication.(2)</p>
<p>Decitabine blocks the action of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which are precursors of myeloid leukemia.(1)</p>
<p>DNMT was found to be mutated in acute myeloid leukemia, causing inappropriate methylation of DNA.(3) By blocking DNMT, Decitabine can reduce methylation in rapidly dividing cells, thereby reducing tumerogenisis. Where cells are inappropriately hypermethylated, reducing methylation appears to reduce tumerogenisis. (4)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks can affect many aspect of cellular biology.  They can affect DNA repair, and hence mutagenesis.  They can affect imprinting, growth, and cell division.   Changes in epigenetic regulation of transcription can silence tumor suppressor genes and initiate transcription of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks can be mitotically heritable.  Therefore, when epigenetic drugs correct any of the dysfunctions in cancer cells, there is the potential for the corrections to be inherited in the cancer cell line.</p>
<p>Progeny cancer cells would therefore have some of the dysfunction corrected, and hence be more susceptible to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when epigenetic marks of somatic tissue are removed and are reset for the pleuripotency of embriogenesis.  In human beings, susceptible periods are during gamete formation and during the early embryonic period.  </p>
<p>Since epigenetic marks are determinant in the formation of the multitude of tissues in the mature organism, disruption of the formation of epigenetic marks during periods when they are forming can be catastrophic for healthy development.</p>
