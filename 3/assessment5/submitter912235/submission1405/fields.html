    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>1. As to CpG islands (CGIs)</em></p>
<p><strong>In general, in normal cells</strong>:</p>
<p>We don't see methylation at CGIs.</p>
<p><strong>In contrast, in cancer cells</strong>:</p>
<p>CGIs are more likely to be methylated. Since CGIs are in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, CGI hypermethylation results in silencing these genes. It is a very effective way of silencing because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. In addition, in cancer cells we have hypermethylation of the regions surrounding CGIs (the CGI shores).</p>
<p> <em>2. As to repetitive elements (repeats) and intergenic regions</em></p>
<p><strong>In normal cells:</strong></p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated. Here, the function of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability (the genome remains genetically normal).</p>
<p><strong>In cancer cells:</strong></p>
<p>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. The consequences of this are reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes, deletions, insertions (in other words, abnormal karyotype due to genomic instability).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is discussed.</p>
<p><strong>In normal cells</strong>:</p>
<p>The imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the <em>maternal</em> allele. The ICR is bound by a protein called CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein, it insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. In this case, the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent. So, we don’t see Igf2 expression for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>The ICR is methylated on the <em>paternal</em> allele. CTCF can no longer bind. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and the enhancers can access Igf2. So, Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p><strong>In Wilm’s tumour:</strong></p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICR happens on the maternal allele as well. As a result, we have loss of imprinting, we have overexpression of Igf2 in comparison to a normal cell. Since Igf2 promotes growth, its overexpression results in tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) belongs to DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors. It gets incorporated into the DNA (instead of 2'-deoxycytidine) upon replication (S-phase of the cell cycle) and then binds DNMT irreversibly. (<em>Note</em>. Clearly, cancer cells which replicate more rapidly than healthy cells in the body are more severely affected.) The decrease of intracellular DNMT quantity results in CGI hypomethylation and, hence, reactivation of the tumour suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome due to mitotic inheritance of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>With respect to epigenetics, sensitive periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming: pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Since epigenetic marks are cleared during sensitive periods, treating patients at these stages would be inadvisable.</p></div>
