    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands of the tumor supressor genes are usually unmethilated. It means that the genes are being expressed and therefore there is no uncontrolled growth of cells. In a cancer cell the CpG islands are usually found methylated. If a tumor supressor gene presents methylation at the CpG islands, it leads to silencing the gene, so the tumor won't be supressed. Consequently, there is expected to be an uncontrolled growth of cells and therefore cancer. It only happens if both aleles express methylation in the promoters of the tumor supressor genes, so none will have this gene activated. This is mitotically heritable, so the daughter cells express the same methylation pattern, leading to the growth of the defective cells and therefore cancer. In a normal cell, the repeats and intergenic regions are hypermethylated, so they are densely packed in the heterochromatin, ensuring the stability of the gene. In cancer, hypomethylation occurs especially in the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. If the repeats are hypomethylated, the chromatin is more open, making the genes more susceptible to recombinations or translocations. The repeats can also make a copy of themselves and act as transposons, disrupting the coding region of a gene or activating neighboring genes. Furthermore, the instability caused by the hypomethylation of these regions can cause insertions and deletions in the genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, Igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele due to methilation of the imprint control region. In the maternal alele, this gene is supressed because the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTFC protein to bind, so H19 is expressed in the maternal allele and expression of Igf2 is supressed. In Wilm's tumour the ICR is methylated in the maternal allele as well as in the paternal allele. It leads to expression of Igf2 in both alleles. Since Igf2 is growth promoting, it contributes to an uncontrolled growth of the cells contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It has the capacity of hypomethylating DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. In cancer, it can help reactivate tumor supressor genes and stop the uncontroled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the epigenetic marks are mitoticaly inheritable. It would be recommended to avoid treating patients in their sensitive periods, which are the periods when the germ cells are being formed. In this period, the cells are epigenetically reprogrammed, so altering methylation with such drugs might have some effect on this reprogramming as well.</p></div>
