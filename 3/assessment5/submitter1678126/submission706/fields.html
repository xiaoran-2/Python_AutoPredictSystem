    <h1>Submission 706 from Anon (session_user_id: fdf586c2bac3af81b4ff63c5ce9ed9385f768215)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) class. This means that the main purpose of this drug is to avoid the instauration of inappropriate epigenetic methylation marks which could potentially drive to tumourigenesis and, as a final step, to carcinogenesis. Since this drug is a nucleoside analog, it can bind in an irreversible way to DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) when the cell target is under DNA replication and inactivate permanently this enzyme following a still not well stablished mechanism of action. Specifically, Decitabine could avoid the silencing by hypermethylation at promoter CpG Islands (CGIs) regions of tumour suppressor genes, helping also to reduce genomic instability.</p>
<p>Decitabine is approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndormes, but it is also under clinical trials against other kind of tumours. Despite his low specificity, Decitabine seems to be well tolerated, mainly because it is more active at low doses, and a remarkable improvement of both life expectancy and quality of life for patients under treatment has been reported.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main reason why epigenetic drugs could have long effects is because epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are mytotically heritable. This means that a single change in the epigenome of one cell could be passed to its daughter cells, in this case by the action of DNA methyltransferases. If this change on the epigenome is positively selected, the effect might last long time.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time where great part of the genome is especially suscepetible to epigenetic changes because it is under epigenetic reprograming, this is removing and stablishing new epigenetic marks. In humans, there are two susceptible periods: fist, the preimplantation and early postimplantation period, when epìgenetic marks are cleared in both paternal and maternal genome, but not in the repeats nor in the imprinted genes. And second, the primordial germ cell developmemt period, where epigenetic marks are cleared throgh all the genome except in the repeats, where there is maintenance of these marks. Accordingly, treating patients with epigenetic drugs during both of these sensitive periods could be clearly dangerous for them and for their offspring because exists a risk of disruption of the epigenome due to the removing or the stablishment of incorrect epigenetic marks by the action of the drug, which could lead to serious effects, some of them life-threatening. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Basically, hypo or hypermethylation of the DNA at Imprinting Control Regions (ICRs) could result in altered expression of growth control genes due to loss of imprinting - loss of parent-of-origin specific expression-, which could lead to a pretumoual situation, one of the hits to DNA stated by Knudson hypothesis. This is a very common early event in most cancer types.</p>
<p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, in a normal situation, Igf2 is silenced in the maternal allele due to the action of CTCF, which binds over unmethylated ICR and blocks the action of downstream enhancers over Igf2, leading then to the expression of H19. On the other side, in the paternal allele, the methylated ICR avoid the binding of CTCF. This situation, in conjuntion with the spreading of methylation to H19, allows downstream enhancers to interact with Igf2 gene and promotes expression of that gene. However, disruption of this cluster by hypermethylation of the ICR leads to overexpression of Igf2 by activation of <strong>both</strong> alleles - paternal <strong>AND</strong> maternal-. Since now there is double production of Igf2 than in a normal cell and Igf2 is a growth promoter, this could result in uncontrolled growth and, by the end and in combination with other factors, in Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As a general rule, in a normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated, a situation that allows the normal function of tumour suppressor genes. In contrast, intergenic regions and, especially, repetitive elements are heavily methylated. This strong methylation has the purpose of avoiding the genomic instabilty caused by repetitive elements, which can illegitimy recombine between them and also transpose within or near a gene, altering the normal expression of the genotype.</p>
<p>However, in cancer, the situation is completely reversed. Now CpG island are strongly methylated, including even adjacent regions called CpG island shores. This could cause not only the silencing of tumour suppressor genes -the genes that "kill" tumoural cells-, but also loss of imprinting in the Imprinted Control Regions (ICR), which could drive to uncontrolled growth promotion of the tumour. On the other hand, now intergenic regions and repetitive element are abnormally hypomethylated. This allows repetitive elements not only to recombine between them and cause an abnormal karyotype by chromosome deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocatons due to a misalignment of the repeats, but also to transpose -to "jump"- within the genome, causing both inactivation of regular genes or aberrant activation of neighbouring genes due to the uncontrolled action of a cryptic promoter. So the result of the alteration of these methylation processes is a considerable increase in genomic instability, a situation which seems to enhance tumorigenesis.</p></div>
