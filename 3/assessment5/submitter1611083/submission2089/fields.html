    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell CpG islands are unmethylated promoter regions of where transcription factors bind enabling the activation of tumor suppressive genes. Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. Methlyation in these regions contribute to genomic stability by densely packaging into heterochromatin.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells CpG islands are hypermethylated. This results in tightly packaged chromatin that silences the activation of the promoter/tumor suppressive gene complex, the result of which is tumorous cancer. Hypomethylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements also contribute to cancer. Hypomethylation in repetitive elements loosens the chromatin resulting in activation, allowing them to jump around the genome. This causes instability, which results in deletions, insertions, duplications, and reciprocal translocations. That is, hypomethylation is an epigenetic aberration within the genome that result in genetic mutations causing cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR (imprint control region) of the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 complex is methylated thus preventing CTCF from binding silencing H19 and thus enables the enhancers to act on Igf2 expressing the Igf2 protein.</p>
<p>In a normal maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to the insulator element which enables the enhancers to act on H19 while Igf2 is silenced.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor is characterized by loss of imprinting in the maternal allele. In this case both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated expressing a double dose of the growth-promoting gene Igf2 resulting in tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-methyltransferase (DMNTi) inhibitor that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome which progresses to AML (acute myelogenous leukemia).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA of the cancer cell. This DNMTi irreversibly binds to DNMT preventing its release and the methylation of the daughter cell during cell division.  As unmethylated daughter cells proliferate during mitosis, tumor suppressor genes are activated having an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that some of the new epigenetic drugs can therapeutically alter DNA methylation (methylation or de-methylation). Importantly this alteration is transferred to the daughter and granddaughter cells and so on during cellular replication, having therapeutic effects long after the initial treatment.  As the harmful effects of genes that are either silenced or activated are mitigated due to the drug; the cancer/tumor load is also mitigated thus increasing the chance of effectiveness of standard chemotherapy.  Unless these drugs can be proven to effect only specific cells within specific tissues (i.e. non-globally), treatment during sensitive periods should be avoided. The critical sensitive periods to avoid are;o germ cell development and early embryo development. These are periods of active epigenetic reprogramming which make them most sensitive to environmental changes.  </p></div>
