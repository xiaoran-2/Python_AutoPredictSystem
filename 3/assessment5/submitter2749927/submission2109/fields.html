    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation (methylation doesn’t tend to occur at CpG islands but in other areas of the genome). Though, there are is a small subset of CpG islands that are dynamically methylated between cell types. In cancer, the global level of methylation decreases as progression from a normal tissue to a metastatic tissue occurs. In addition, methylation at some CpG islands becomes denser in cancer (CpG islands become more likely to be methylated). Disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease in that disruption of DNA methylation in CpG islands can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer and can also be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis (cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA).</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is believed to be to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, hypomethylation occurs at intergenic regions/repeats as well as genomic instability. This can lead to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Deletions and insertions (gaining parts of chromosomes) arising from this can be seen in cancer. Hypomethylation occurs to some degree in all tumor types tested and progresses with tumorigenicity. In fact, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation leads to genomic instability which in turn leads to diseases such as cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele. On the paternal allele there is methylation so the enhancers can act on Igf2 since there is no CTCF binding and Igf2 can be expressed. The imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele. When it is unmethylated CTCF will bind the element and enhancers will act on H19; thus Igf2 will be silent on the maternal allele and expression will not be seen.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor hypermethylation due to loss of imprinting occurs. This leads to a dose of Igf2 from both the paternal and maternal allele, as CTCF no longer binds and enhancers in the maternal allele become free to act on Igf2 as opposed to H19. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to disease because it causes double the dose of Igf2 to occur than would naturally in a normal cell. Igf2 is growth promoting and is highly associated with Wilm’s tumor; a childhood kidney tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypomethylates DNA. Decitabine functions in a similar manner to azacitidine and when combined with a histone-deacetylase inhibitor could slow tumor growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. By causing hypomethylation it is possible for proper imprinting to occur (which is lost in the presense of hypermethylation).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes can be transgenerational and can be passed on to the offspring for several generations to come. There are sensitive periods when changes in the environment may be able to influence epigenetic makeup. The sensitive periods of development include primordial germ cells up to gametes. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because there could be lasting effects on germ cell development which would thus inhibit the epigenetic machinery.  </p></div>
