    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells DNA methylation occurs in the intergenic region, in the repetitive elements and also in the introns of the gene. These normal cells are also, characteristically, hipomethylated in the CpG islands. In cancer, however, global patterns of DNA methylation are altered with hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions and hypermethylation of many CpG islands.</p>
<p>The hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which normally comprise the majority of a cell's methyl-cytosine content, can activate transposable elements and contribute to the genomic instability observed in cancer cells. Simultaneously, cancer cells typically show hypermethylation within the promoter regions of many CpG island-associated tumor suppressor genes. Consequently, these genes are transcriptionally silenced resulting in a loss-of-function.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele is methylated in the ICR so CTCF cannot bound to it. This allows distal enhancers to act on Igf 2, resulting in expression of Igf 2. In the maternal allele the lack of methylation of the ICR allows CTCF to bind to it, blocking the distal enhancers and preventing their access to IGF2 and allowing the access to the H19, which results in non-expression of Igf 2 and expression of H19.</p>
<p>Genes that are imprinted are expressed only from one parental allele. So to disrupt the imprinting gene, contributing to disease, either both alleles are expressed due to activation of the silent allele or both are not expressed due to suppression of the normally active allele. This is caused by alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs that can be hypo or hypermethylated. In the case of Wilm’s tumour the maternal ICR, that is normally unmethylated, becomes methylated and so there is no bounding with CTCF and Igf 2 is expressed. Therefor Igf 2 is double expressed (in the paternal and the maternal allele) due to hypermethylation of  maternal ICR. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug that affects epigenetic process and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a DNA-demethylating agent, that incorporates into DNA, up on replication, and it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, therefor it is a DNMT inhibitor. In high doses they are toxic but in low doses exert anti-tumor effects. And as the action of these DNMT inhibitors is division dependent, cancer cells will be more severely affected because they divide more rapidly than other normal cells. That’s why Decitabine can have a anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A sensitive period is essentially a period of fastest growth and development. There are two sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming: during germ cell development and during early development.</p></div>
