    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The function of DNA methylation at CpG islands in a normal cell is silence genes but in cancer, DNA methylation at CpG islands becomes denser and it progresses over time, it means that hypermethylation occurs. The CpG islands are in the promoters of tumour supressors genes and when DNA methylation happens, it silence this supressors genes. In other words, tumour supressors genes can't be expressed. Disruption of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell are maintain genomic stability, so in cancer, there is a genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes, because of intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. Disruption of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmathylated and CTCF 4 bind is insulator element, thus the enhancers will act in H19. But lgf2 will be silent, so we don't see expression. In contrast, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele so the enhancers can act in lgf2 because CTCF 4 is not binding to insulate the ICR and lgf2 can be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is methylated on the maternal allele, so it can expresses lgf2 such as on the paternal allele occurs. Therefore we have a double dose of lgf2 and we know that lgf2 is growth promoting, then this is what happens in this tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DMNTi class of epigenetic inhibitors and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. This inhibits DNA methyltransferases 1, nucleoside analogues get incorporated into the DNA, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase 1 comes along to bind that nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released. Aditionally this methyltransferase inhibitor is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating and cancer cells which are dividing faster than other cells in the body will be more severely affected. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div class="sec">
<p>Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes. That could result from altered external signaling due to permanent stress and act in concert to lock in the cancer epigenome.</p>
