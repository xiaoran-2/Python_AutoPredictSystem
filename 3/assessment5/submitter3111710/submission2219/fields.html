    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the CpG islands are not methylated so the genes of this CGI are expressed. DNA methylation in CpG island lead to silencing of the nearby and adjacent genes in cancer cells. Moreover the repetitive and other intergenic regions in cancer cells are hypomethylated. In cancer cells, The hyper methylation of CpG island  of tumour suppressor gene leads to inactivation of those genes which suppress tumour growth.</p>
<p>Hyper methylation in CpG islands leads to silencing of the tumour suppressor genes that leads to uncontrollable growth of tumours due to lack of control over the growth. This hyper methylation is heritable and have same effect as mutation on the tumour suppressor gene. </p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated heavily so that those region not accessible to the enzyme and remains inactive. The methylation in these region provide Genetic stability to the cell. In cancer cells, there is genome wide hypo methylation including intergenic region and repetitive elements that's leads to genetic instability due to Illegitimate recombination between repeats,  activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.  This increase the chance and progress of tumerogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">In parental normal cells, ICR is methylated which inhibit the binding of CTCF protein to ICR. So the enhancer bind and activate Igf2. In Normal cells, the maternal allele for H19 is expressed. The Imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated and it bind with CTCF protein which allows the enhancer to transcribe the H19. This leads to Igf2 silencing. In Wilm tumour patients, the ICR  is methylated in both parents. This leads to activation of Igf2 in both locus which becomes double strength compared to normal . This increase in the Igf2 increases the cell size as it codes for growth hormone.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Body1">Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent sold as  Dacogen by Eisai (Japanese company). Its mechanism is similar to  azacitidine   and it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine hypo methylate the DNA by inhibiting to DNA methyl transferase. They are nuceloside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, Decitabine-induced hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are essential  for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.</p>
<p>Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The overall genomic level of methylation is decreased or hypomethylated; in particular, the normally hypermethylated and silent regions containing the repetitive elements are substantially demethylated. Conversely, many normally unmethylated CpG island-containing genes often become hypermethylated and inactivated. Unlike genetic mutations, hypermethylation affects multiple genes in the cancer cell by concordant hypermethylation. Demethylases are the drugs commonly used in cancer treatment. They demethylate the CpG islands and CpG shores thereby de-repress the repressed genes eg. Tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Such treatments are time dependent. The sensitive period of establishment of epigenetic marks in the genome are identified before drug treatment. Sensitive period is defined as the period of establishment of epigenetic marks. After drug treatment, the epigenetic marks are reprogrammed. epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.  Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. However, treatment during early development and primordial germ cell development should be avoided as they are considered as sensitive period in the development of human.</p></div>
