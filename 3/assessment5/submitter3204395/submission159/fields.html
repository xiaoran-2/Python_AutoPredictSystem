    <h1>Submission 159 from Anon (session_user_id: 53516f403bf6e857367c7fb41b75b3be2bb8f998)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because of the methylation the Enhancers can act on the Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to insulate the ICR and Igf2 is expressed from the Paternal allele.</p>
<p>When the ICR is unmethylated the CTCF will bind the insulator element and then the Enhancers will act on the H19 and as a result the Igf2 will be silent and so we don't see any expression.</p>
<p> In addition to silencing known and candidate tumour suppressors, aberrant DNA  methylation affects expression of imprinted genes. Loss of imprinting (LOI) of  <em>IGF2</em> and the tightly-linked <em>H19</em> locus has been associated with  tumorigenesis in a variety of patients. In Wilms' tumour, imprinted expression  of <em>IGF2</em> is commonly relaxed resulting in maternal allele expression. This is associated  with increased methylation and reduced expression from the maternal copy of the  tightly linked <em>H19</em> locus</p>
<p>The mechanisms and methylation events underlying the LOI at <em>H19</em> and  <em>IGF2</em> vary from tumour to tumour, however, maternal allele methylation is  commonly acquired at sequences that include the <em>H19</em> promoter and  <em>IGF2</em> enhancer blocker which can simultaneously silence <em>H19</em>  and activate <em>IGF2</em> on the maternal chromosome</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to small molecule inhibitors class of chemical compounds known as DNMTi.</p>
<p>Decitabine decreases DNA methylation</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA and celular differentiation or apoptosis producing the anti-tumor effect as a result.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> In adult somatic cells (cells in the body, not used for reproduction), DNA methylation typically occurs in a CpG dinucleotide context;  non-CpG methylation is prevalent in embryonic stem cells Unmethylated CpGs are often grouped in clusters called CpG islands, which are present in the 5' regulatory regions of many genes.</p>
<p> In many disease processes, such as cancer, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division.  Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. </p>
<p>In cancer DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription and a large body of evidence has demonstrated that genes with high levels of  5-methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent, and that DNA methylation gradually accumulates upon long-term gene  silencing. DNA methylation is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally  transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to  normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the  promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and  progression of cancer through different mechanisms.</p>
<p>A major contributor toward the overall DNA hypomethylation is hypomethylation of tandem and interspersed DNA repeats, which is observed in most examined cancers . Most hypomethylation of DNA repeats in cancers is apparently the result of demethylation</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of repeats/ intergenic intervals • Genomic Instability (deletions,insertions, reciprocal translocations) - Illegitimate recombination between repeats - Activation of repeats and transposition - Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A common type of epigenomic modification is called methylation. Methylation involves attaching small molecules called methyl groups, each consisting of one carbon atom and three hydrogen atoms, to segments of DNA. When methyl groups are added to a particular gene, that gene is turned off or silenced, and no protein is produced from that gene.</p>
<p>There are periods during postnatal development in which the developing brain has heightened sensitivity to environmental influences. These sensitive periods represent heightened epochs of brain plasticity, where the early environment is able to shape neural circuits and thus determine structural and functional aspects of brain and behavior for the lifespan.</p>
<p>The epigenome is sensitive to the environment (it can be changed as a result of environmental influences).</p>
