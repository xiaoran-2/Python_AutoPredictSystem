    <h1>Submission 931 from Anon (session_user_id: 087a7674c473d8abb43cc678e6197a24f2ac785c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabin is a FDA approved drug able to inhibit DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1). DNMT1 is able to copy the methylation state of a cell from one allele to the other, allowing the heritance of the methylation state during mitosis. Decitabin is a nucleoside (cytosine) analog that DNMT1 binds during cell division. The binding is irreversible and results in the complete repression of DNMT1 activity. Unmethylated cells are not able to complete their division and die. Decitabin acts on cells that are dividing and it seems to have a preference for highly dividing cells, like cancer cells. This contributes to cell division arrest of tumor cells, providing the anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can occur in several regions of the genome. It is usually observed in repetitive elements and intragenic regions, but it can also be present at CpG islands. Normal cells do not usually have hypermethylated CpG islands, but when it happens at the promoter levels, it correlates with transcriptional repression of the specific gene. Interestingly, cancer cells present hypermethylated CpG islands at the promoter of tumor suppressor genes and hypomethylated intragenic regions or repetitive elements. The hypermethylation of tumor suppressor promoters leads to a repression of transcription of tumor suppressors favoring aberrant cell division. On the other side, methylation of repetitive elements and intragenic regions is paricularly important in the maintainace of genome stability, intended as the ability of the cells to assure the right number of chromosomes and the absence of illegitimate recombination (recombination between regions that do not have genetic identity).  In a normal cell, the fact that repetitive elements are highly methylated reduces the changes of recombination to occur because the chromatin is tighly pacted. Conversely, the hypomethylation observed in intragenic regions of cancer cells allows illegitimate recombination to happen, providing a new and instable set of chromosomes to the cell. Of note, hypomethylated repetitive elements can jump around and affect the activation state of neighboring genes .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene imprinting determines the transcription of specific genes from only one allele, maternal or paternal, depending which one has been silenced. The cluster Igf2/H19 is a classical example of imprinting. The transcription of Igf2 depends on the activation of a neighbouring gene, H19, which produces a long non coding RNA. Usually H19 is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal one. Accordingly, it will be expressed in the maternal allele and not in the paternal one. H19 silence Igf2 expression therefore Igf2 will be silenced in the maternal allele. Imprinting is dysregulated in cancer, and in this case, both maternal and paternal alleles will be hypermethylated and allow the silencing of H19 trough CTCF. Both of the alleles will activate Igf2 expression, that being a gene involved in cell growth, will lead to cancer. The loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is associated to Wilm's tumor, affecting kidneys in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic cange and is hereditable, as the definition of epigenetics by Dr. Rigges states. A change in the DNA pattern can be transmitted from one cell to the two deriving ones and will be maintained throughout divisions. At the same time the use of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors, like Vidaza, should't be used by young chidren because of the presence of cells that still need to be programed or by men wo intend to procreate or women in gestation. DNA methylation is crucial in development and alteration of its pattern can have extremely toxic effects in individuals where development is still occurring. This can lead to mutation or imprinting diseases in embryos conceived by parents using DNA methylase inhibitors or to tumors in young people.</p></div>
