<p style="text-align:left;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">CpG islands, which are actually CpG repeats within the promoter of most mammalian cells tend normally to be unmethylated despite the active or not expression of the genes. CpG methylation normally is associated more commonly with the formation of a repressive chromatin structures and more rarely with gene silencing, probably in poor CpG gene promoters by inhibiting the binding of rare transcriptional factors. In contrast with normal cells, in cancer cells promoters there's hypermethylation of CpG islands, leading to gene silencing, especially of tumor suppresor genes, who play a determining role in normal cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair. Additionally, tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often the more frequent alteration in cancer, rather than mutation. It's important to note that the identity of hypermethylated CGIs varies among different tumor types.</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Normally, in healthy cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found to be methylataled, in order to protect the cell from genomic instability by preserving genomic integrity, whereas in cancer cells those same regions are often found to be unmethylated. The loss of DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cell lead actually to genomic instability which can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions due to genomic instability can be observed in cancer cell due to the loss of intergenic and repetitive elements methylation. </span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Generally, cancer is characterized by genome-wide loss and regional gain of DNA methylation, fact that finally leads <span><span>on one hand to genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific imprinted genes and on the other hand in silencing of tumor suppressor genes .</span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

Example of the above fact is the loss of imprinting of the </span></span></span><span><span>H19/Igf2 </span></span><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span><span> cluster in Wilm's tumor. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span><span>Normally, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, permitting that way the expression of the Igf2 gene, which is a growth promoting gene. In contrast, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, which enables  CTCF to bind at the ICR and disable the expression of Igf2 and instead permit the expression of H19. In Wilm's tumor, what 's observed, is the loss of imprinting of the maternal allele, meaning the abnormal methylation  of the maternal ICR, which results in Igf2 expression in both parental and maternal alleles. In conclusion, the overexpression of  Igf2 due to the loss of imprinting of  the maternal allele, promotes tissue growth and tumorogenesis in the case of Wilm's tumor. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"><span><span>DNMT inhibitors act as nucleoside analogues who irreversibly bind to DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA during DNA replication. That means that they are replication dependent and so they have a very specific action in cancer cell who show generally a high replication rate- controversially to normal cells- and so they are the more affected ones. Additionally, DNMT inhibitors lead to the non methylation of the daughter strand during DNA replication of fast replicating tumor cells, which is really important in the case of myelodysplastics syndromes where CpG island are found to be heavily methylated.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

This is why epigenetic therapies are considered to be able to provoke changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. For instance, in the case of Myelodysplastic syndromes where CpG island are found to be heavily methylated the use of DNMT inhibitors who alter DNA mathylation can have a favorable effect on the disease by “erasing” the “abnormal”, malignancy causing hypermethylation of CpG islands in daughter cells and so reversing the disease. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As sensitive are characterized the pre-implantation period during early development- embryogenesis and during primordial germ-cell development when epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained .</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
