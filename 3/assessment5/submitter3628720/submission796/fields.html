    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is very stable epigenetic mark, which is mitotically heritable, that means that the daughter cell will have the same pattern after a cell division.<br /> CpG islands are clusters of repeats of C and G with the p standing for the phosphor binding between them. Many CpG islands are located in promoter regions and are kept free from methylation in the normal cell. <br />These islands are methylated in imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation and the formation of heterochromatin. Methylation of CpG islands generally means silencing of that gene or whole chromosome.This occurs through binding of specifi proteins (MECP) that inihibits transcription and condenses the chromatin.</p>
<p>CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated in cancer and the underlying genes are silenced. Tumor supressor genes, controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair, are silenced this way. This makes the cell continue dividing even with disruptions in the DNA. <br />Epigenetic silencing of CpG islands can be one of the hits in the Knudson cancer hypothesis.<br />Different sets of CpG islands are hypermethylated in different types of cancer and can be used as a marker to distinguish a metastasis origin and also the prognosis of the disease. </p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and repetetive elements tend to be methylated in the normal cell. The silencing of  the intergenic intervals seems to necessary for keeping genomic stability and avoid deletions, insertions and translocations when dividing. Keeping them silent is also a way of avoiding transcription interference and keep the timing of replication. <br />The repetitive elements are usually silenced to keep genomic integrity. Silencing transponsable elements, the strong promotors that are associated with them and also preventing recombination. <br />The repetetive elements and intergenic regions tend to be hypotmethylated in cancer, contributing to a unstable genome. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes are parent-of-origin specific, that means only one allele is expressed. This is aquired through methylation of the imprint control region (ICR), responsible for the expression of the gene. Methylation of the ICR is not synonymous with silencing. In the case of Igf2 it's paternally imprinted, that is the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal unmethylated. When the ICR is unmethylated the protein CTCF can bind and insulate the Igf2 gene from enhancers and the gene wont be expressed. The opposite happens in the paternal allele, where CTCF cant bind and insulate and therefore Igf2 is expressed. <br />Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone, an oncogene. In the case of Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is lost, usually through deletion/mutation or uniparental disomy. This will lead to over expression of Igf2 and unrestricted growth. This makes it possible for the cancer cells to expand and grow in an uncontrolled fashion.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug apporved for use in Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute Myeoloid Leukemia and is a DNA-demethylating agent. I is an nucleoside analouge and will be incorporated in to the genome when the cells are dividing. The drug is dependent on replication, which usually is more frequent in cancer cells than in normal cells. It acts on Demethyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) by irreversibly binding it, preventing methylation to occur. The daughter strands will then be unmethylated and this might help to put important genes, like the tumor supressor ones on. This will start the process of getting a more normal methylation pattern back and through that have an anti-tumour effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering epigenetic marks, such as methylation can have long term effects since the eradication of them will be inherited in the upcoming generations. The marks will not be put back on again and the right genes will be expressed, like tumor supressors and DNArepair proteins. <br />In human development there are two sensitive periods, when the genome is more suceptible to epigenetic changes than at other times. One is during early development, just after the egg and the sperm has joined - in the pre-implantaion period. The epigenetic marks they were carrying needs to be erased to allow for totipotency in the developing fetus. The second period is during primordial germ cell development, where the epigenetic marks of the somatic cells needs to be erased. During these periods the methylation marks are temporarilly erased actively and passively to be put back on again in specific patterns, depending on the cell type. <br />Giving a demethylating agent during these sensiitive periods might affect the genome of the gametes or the fetus in early development, giving rise to long term epigenetic changes that might make the child or the grandchildren prone to cancer or birth defects.</p>
