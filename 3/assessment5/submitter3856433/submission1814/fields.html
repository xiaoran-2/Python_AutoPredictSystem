    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Methylation and Cancer</strong></p>
<p> Epigenetic states are not definitive, and changes occur with age in response to environmental stimuli. Epigenetic phenomena are mediated by a variety of molecular mechanisms: DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications (PTMs), ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, polycomb/trithorax protein complexes, and noncoding RNAs.</p>
<p> Between that processes the best-characterized epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, that process consists of the addition of a methyl group to the fifth carbon of the cytosine pyrimidine ring. In mammals, this occurs mostly in cytosines of the CpG dinucleotides. In the human genome, CpGs are asymmetrically distributed into CpG-poor regions and dense regions called “CpG islands,” which span the 5’ end of the regulatory region of approximately half of all genes. In normal cells, the CpG islands are usually unmethylated, whereas the sporadic CpG sites in the rest of the genome are generally methylated.</p>
<p> However in the case of a cancer cell, the pattern of methylation is altered such that the CpG islands are hypermethylated, leading the silencing of tumor suppressor genes as Rb(retinoblastoma), p16INK4a (an inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases), BRCA1 (involven in DNA repair) between others or genes involved in cell cycle regulation as p53, triggering a failure in the correct regulation of the development of the cell, which can thus acquire abnormal proliferative properties, and subsequently developed tumor invasion to other tissues.</p>
<p> Also being present in the CpG’s islands, DNA methylation is also performed in intronic and repetitive sequences as telomeres, centrómeros and microsatellites, such regions are hypermethylated in healthy cells, this in order to prevent transcription and this genomic instability, however in a tumor cells are hypomethylated these regions, thereby promoting the expression of retrotransposable elements, for example, SINES and LINES and new insertions that may have fatal consequences</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Imprinting and Cancer</strong></p>
<p>One of the mechanisms that are related with this phenomenom is the insulator model of imprinting, which is employed by the H19/Igf2 imprinted locus, the gene H19 it’s expressed by the mother and the locus Igf2 is expressed by the father, their reciprocal imprinting it’s mediated by the CTCF insulator that is located between the genes.</p>
<p> In this way because the ICR are methylated on the paternal allele, CTCF doesn’t binding to the ICR and allows that  Igf2expreses, but it is also required the methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19 . In contrast in the maternal allele CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR because the region are not methylated, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 gain access to the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator.</p>
<p> In the case of the Wilm’s tumour, some authors seen that IGF2 mRNA was expressed in Wilm’s Tumours and expression patterns were consistent with IGF2/H19 enhancer competition. These observations implicate genetic and epigenetic inactivation of H19 in Wilms' tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Drugs for treat Cancer</strong></p>
<p> Many drugs have been developed to combat cancer, for example one of the drugs currently employed are the Decitabine, wich is a demethylating agent, therefore is able to counteract the action of DNA methyl transferase (DNMT’s), creating adducts in the DNA as which prevents DNA methyl transferases can bind and carry out it’s function, which promotes tumor suppressor genes that were turned off in tumor cells as PTEN or p53, re-establish it’s function and regulate correctly division and proliferation cellular processes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Cancer and periods of drug treatment</strong></p>
<p>Although epigenetic marks are not permanent, some of which can be transmitted from one generation to another. In the case of methylation, a disruption of this pattern can induce the turn- off or turn on of genes along development of primordial germ cells. That period correspond a sensitive period that be characterized by being particularly susceptible to environmental signals promoting the alteration of it’s epigenome.</p>
<p>Another period of sensitivity occurs during early development of the organism, because in this is period takes place a epigenetic reprogramming that means “clear and establishment of new epigenetics marks on the cell”.</p>
<p> For this feature has been proposed that the administration of anti-carcinogenic drugs in this periods of sensitivity it’s better , because the cell has being in the process of rewriting epigenetic memory, and it’s more easy alter the cell orders, returning them to a normal state</p></div>
