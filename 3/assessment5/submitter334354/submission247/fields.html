    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal tissue there is hypomethylation of the CpG islands in order to allow transcription of the tumor suppressor genes. There is hypermethylation in other areas of the genome. In cancer cells, there is hypermethylation of these CpG islands which results in suppression of the tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation extends about 2kb is both directions from the CpG islands. When tumor suppressor genes are suppressed the cell is in a state of enhanced growth potential. This is selected for by natural selection. DNA methylation is present in intergenic regins and repetitive regions to stabilize the genome. When there are areas that are very repetitive, methylating them keeps them from recombining with the incorrect chromosome. If these repeats are hypomethylated they can recombine which can result in deletions and deplucations. If a repeat of a gene results in increased transcription of a growth promoting gene  or the deletion of a gene results in loss of a tumor suppressor, cancer can result.</p>
<p>Both hypomethylation of the genome and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes can result in cancer. If a particular cancer is driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation, then decreasing the DNA methylation decreases the growth of the tumor. If a tumor is driven by genomic instability, then decreases DNA methylation will increase the chances of developing a tumor because of the increased risk of aberrant recombination. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells sometimes there is hypomethylation or hypermethylation of imprinted. This is not unusual because many imprinted genes are involved in growth. In the paternal allele the CTCF imprint control region is methylated which means that the enhancers act on IGF2 because there is no insulator on the CTCF imprint control region. In the maternal allele the CTCF region has an insulator which means that the enhancers act on the H19 gene instead of the IGF2 region. This results in one parental allele being active for insulin growth factor (paternal) and one being not active (maternal). In Wilm's tumor, both the maternal and paternal allleles are hypermethylated (CTCF, imprinting control region) which means that the enhancers stimulate both IGF2 regions which results in a double dose of this growth promoting gene. Loss of imprinting is seen in many tumor types and can be even seen in premalignant tissue. In the case of the H19/IGF2 region the result is an excess of growth promotion. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitibine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. At low doses Decitabine causes DNA demethylation or hypomethylation. Decitabine has its hypomethylating effect by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds to DNMT. This will only have an effect during the S phase of cell division.  SInce DNMT is irreversibly bound it cannot methylate or suppress transcription of DNA. By hypomethylating tumor suppressor cells, Decitabine allows those genes to be active and inhibit cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark  which can be passed  to subsequent cell generations so altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects.  Epigenetic patterns are initially established as a result of developmental cues and are maintained even after these signals are no longer present. The sensitive period is the time when the environment has the greatest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the organism. It is when the epigenome is being remodeled and therefore is most sensitive to disruption. The sensitive periods are during the periods of preimplantation development  and during primordial germ cell development. Pregnancy would be an exclusion factor for the drug use because it could affect the mother, the embryo and the primordial germ cells that will become the grandchildren. Sensitive periods could alos refer to gamete development during puberty which is most active between 8-10 in females and 9-12 in males. Though the female does have her supply of gametes from 2 months gestation in utero. Treating a patient during these sensitive times is inadvisable because the environment (drug) would have its greatest effect on the epigenome which could affect not only the person being treated but subsequent generations.</p></div>
