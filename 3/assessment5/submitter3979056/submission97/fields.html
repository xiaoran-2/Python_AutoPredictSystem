    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically located at gene promoters (and as such are generally unmethylated in healthy cells), and if they are methylated, this typically leads to gene silencing. In cancer cells, CpG island methylation is often reversed: previously silenced (methylated) islands are activated and vice versa. Typically, growth genes are inappropriately activated, and growth inhibiting genes are silenced, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in healthy cells. This is because repetitive elements, most notably transposable elements, are mutagenic in nature and once they are activated, they cause genomic instability (through chromosome translocations, deletions or insertions). In fact, most of DNA methylation occurs in the transposable elements, so it was conjectured that the primary goal of DNA methylation was to protect the genome from these mutagents (by T. Bestor).  In cancer, and these methyl marks are often lost and the subsequent loss of genomic integrity can ultimately result in tumour growth. It is also woth noting that on balance, cancers are characterised by overall DNA <em>demethylation</em>, because the regions that are hypermethylated in cancer (CpG islands and some other gene promoters) are small and far apart (they form about 2% of the whole genome), while the regions which are hypermethylated in cancer are much more widely spread along the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A single set of tissue-specific enhancers regulates the expression of both Igf2 and H19, depending on the methylation of the imprint control region (ICR). On the maternal allele, where the ICR is unmethylated, an insulator protein called CTCF binds on the ICR and prevents enhancement further upstream, so only H19 is activated. On the other hand, when the ICR is methylated (paternal allele), CTCF cannot bind, so the enhancers can access Igf2 and activate it. Also, the ICR methylation on paternal allele spreads downstream, silencing H19 (see picture below, based on our lecture slides).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the imprint control region is methylated on both alleles, which results in double activation of Igf2 and double silencing of H19. Igf2 is a growth promoter and therefore its inappropriate double activation is likely to lead to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of DNA-demethylating agents, which inhibits the activity of DNA methyltransferase. As a result, a patient treated with Decitabine will experience lower rates of DNA methylation, which is beneficial in certain types of cancer. In cancers, where growth-suppressing genes are inappropriately methylated (and thus silenced), treatment with Decitabine can be used to disrupt the process of mitotic heritability of methylation marks, and therefore daughter cells will not inherit the hypermethylation of their parent cells completely (see below).Of course, this treatment will affect all cells, but since tumour cells divide much faster than healthy ones, the effect of Decitabine on them will be more pronounced, and thus, the growth of tumours can be suppressed.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Drugs that inhibit DNA methyltranferase render parent cells only partially able to pass on their methylation marks onto their progeny. The daughter cells, therefore, inherit less methylation than they would without the treatment. Suppose now that the patient stops using the drug, but some of her cells have already undergone mitotic division. Now, the daughter cells have less methylation than their parents and in the next round of division, they will pass on these lower levels of methylation to their progeny and this effect will presumably persist for the following generations. (see below)<br /><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-455b8707f3046e4df6cee26f/970238/asst-5/970238-520790ed06e6a8.33776307.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time of intense epigenetic reprogramming. This occurs (1) in pre-implantation stage of an embryo and (2) in the development of primordial germ-cells. (1) is mostly a non-issue, because a woman is unlikely to undergo this treatment while pregnant. Concerning (2), in females, the remethylation of oocytes occurs after birth, so treating childhood cancer with these drugs could lead to problems with fertility. However, epigenetic drugs would be ill-advised to child patients anyway, since their cells are expected to undergo many divisions further in life, so tampering with their epigenetic marks can have prfound effects in future.</p></div>
