    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands in general is to keep a gene inactive, in a normal cell DNA methylation at CpG islands is relatively low and a gene is active, but in a cancer the DNA methylation of CpG islands starts incrementing from a normal tissue to neoplasia and invasion (being invasion the one with the most CpG island methylation). Normally CpG islands are in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, so when these islands are highly methylated the tumour suppressor genes are silenced and the cell can’t regulate very well the cell cycle or initiate apoptosis. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated, intergenic regions are usually to maintain stability. Dnmt1 null cells display instability and abnormal karyotypes. The normal function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats to prevent transposition or to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. In cancer the level of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated, so the genomic integrity is disrupted and there is transcriptional interference, we tend to see deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations in chromosomes. These disruptions cause the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes, the intergenic regions are disalign and recombination can occur in cancer because they are not packed down into heterochromatin.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region in the paternal allele is generally methylated which impeded CTCF from binding so the enhancers can enhance Igf2, the imprinted control region in the maternal allele is unmethylated, H19 is produced in the maternal allele but that long non coding RNA has a particular role in a particular miRNA. When the ICR in the maternal allele is unmethylated a protein called CTCF binds and insulates Igf2 from enhancers, if the ICR in the maternal allele is methylated CTCF can’t bind and cannot insulate Igf2. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can acces Igf2. Wilm’s tumour which is a common tumour in a child’s kidney can happen at the loss of Cdkn1c (which is a tumour suppressor) and the upregulation of Igf2 (which is an oncogene and promotes growthing) in the H19/Igf2 cluster, this can be caused by mutation/deletion to lose imprinting, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption. By having an upregulation of an oncogene and the loss of a tumour suppressor the cell will keep growing and it will not initiate apoptosis which will cause the tumour.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, with a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor it can slow tumour growth. Decitabine allows the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine incorporates into DNA; it inhibits cell proliferation through nonreversible covalent linking with DNA methyltransferase and blocking of DNA synthesis, it also induces hypomethylation, thereby promoting cell differentiation, re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, stimulation of immune mechanisms, and suppression of tumor growth. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are erased, in the economist article ''Cancer's epicentre'' Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drug altered the tumour cells in some lasting way.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic change. Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. If the drug alters the DNA methylation, this change will be mitotically heritable. A sensitive period is the period when the epigenome is actively remodeled that means it has the removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks. Those periods include the primordial cell development through mature eggs/sperm and preimplantation and postimplantation periods. We should avoid treating patients during the sensitive period of development, because in this period there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms and the epigenome is actively remodeling, (the epigenome is highly susceptible to environmental stimuli such as diet, drugs, environmental agents, and maternal behavior) and can alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes.</p></div>
