    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer in cancer cells is the opposite of DNA methylation in normal cells.  Typically in a normal cell, CpG islands near certain genes are unmethylated which allows for expression of those allelles. These allelles usually suppress cell growth or bring about apoptosis.  In the cancer cell, however, CpG islands are methylated.  This methlyation suppresses the expression of genes which results in tumor cell proliferation. </p>
<p>Intergenic regions are usually methylated which silences repetitive elements, prevents transcriptional interference, and generally promotes genomic stability. Again, in cancer the situation is reversed. The repetitive elements are not silenced.  This leads to repeats expressing abnormally as well as cryptic gene promoters expressing to cause feedback effects and disruption to various other genes in the DNA sequence.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer through methylation of the paternal allelle. In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) for the paternal allelle is methylated, which allows gene promoters ("enhancers") to act on Igf2 in the paternal allelle.  Additionally, the ICR methylation in the paternal allelle has the effect of silencing the H19 long non-coding DNA (lncDNA). </p>
<p>Also in the normal cell, the ICR for Igf2 on the maternal allelle <em>is</em> methylated which causes the protein CTCF to insulate the Igf2 gene from the effects of the downstream gene promoters.  Instead of acting on Igf2, the gene promoters act on the H19 gene to produce a in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In cancer there is a loss of imprinting at the ICR for the H19/Igf2 cluster and the result is similar to having two paternal allelles and no maternal allelle. Igf2 is over expressed and growth is promoted beyond what is normal.  This is the case with Wilm's tumour and and a loss of imprinting at ICRs is a hallmark of cancer in general. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes.  The drug removes hyper-methylated histone proteins and allows for the expression of tumor-suppressor genes, which are silenced in cancer.  The article suggests that, because this is an epigenetic modification, the effects of the drug my proliferate across generations of cells.  In essence, the demethylation brought about by the drug may occur naturally in daughter cells.  The anit-tumor effects of the drug result from the expression of tumor-suppressor genes and the prevention of transmitting hyper-methylation across cell generations.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Patterns of DNA methylation are passed from mother cells to daughter cells. Altering this pattern in a cancerous mother cell, to bring about demethylation, is changing the epigenomic structre of the cell which will live on in later cell generations.  </p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that cause demethylation during sensitive periods is inadvisable because these are periods of genomic reprogramming, when substantial demethylation is already occurring in the cells.  This typically occurrs early in development, around the formation of the blastocyst and then again at mid-gestation.  Treating a patient during these periods could result in abberantly demethylated epigenomes being created a passed across subsequent cell generations.</p></div>
