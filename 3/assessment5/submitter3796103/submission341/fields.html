<p class="western">the normal Dna methylation profile at CpG islands is hypomethylated and methylated  at repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed, even in the introns of genes<br /><br />In contrast,in cancer cells, the CpG islands  methylation pattern are more likely to be methylated and, the rest of the genome in general including the repetitive elements,these intergenic elements and indeed the introns are hypometilated.<br /><br />And so, we see this kind of swap, a reciprocal cross, a swap in terms of CpG islands ,repetitive and intergenic region dna methylathyon profiles in both of two cells.<br /><br />the function of this dna methylation profile at CpG islands it is due to its location at the gene promoters so this hypometilated state is able to lead to its expression.CpG islands that are found in cancer are in general in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes.So, this is because it is one way in which a cancer cell is able to inactivate tumor suppressor genes.it can do it epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in inactive state. <br /><br />One of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability. the consequence of this hypomethylation  are in this way due to  genomic instability what ends up bringing on illegitimate recombination :reciprocal translocations ,transpose events,insertions and deletions.<br /><br />Normally, this recombination wouldn't happen because the repeats would be heavily methylated and also they'd be heterchromatonized. However,  recombination could happen in the repeats because of alignment between these repeats. The  hypometilation of these regions can cause they misalign, and then an illegitimate recombination can occur because they are also not densely packaged down into heterochromosomes.<br /><br />The repeats can also be activated because of the hypometilation. This means that the repeats have the capacity to actually  jump around the genome or transpose themselves and so disrupt the coding region of a gene but it also may activate neighboring genes.<br /><br /> </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in cancer DNA methylation patterns  include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation.This changes cause respectively both<br />genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. And since this epigenetic state can be inherited , so it is maternaly inheritable is a very good way to spread and keeping a cancerigenic expression pattern. And thus is the reason why  enduring effects are being had on the epigenome<br /><br /> DNA methylation reprogramming  occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)and this period is so called sensitive period<br />Treating patients during  this sensitive period would be inadvisable because of losing DNA methilation profile during this phases might bring on genome- wide expression alterations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<p> one of the common features of cancer cells is they display loss of imprinting .So genes that should be display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, no longer show this imprint of expression but rather they become either expressed both parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles. And the reason this is common feature  in cancer is probably because lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth In some way. Either they're growth promoting or growth suppressing genes<br />  IGF2 cluster imprint contrrol region is methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br />When it's unmethylated CTCF  bind its insulator element, and it means that the enhancers in this case will act on H19. because of that methylation pattern Igf2 will be silenced for the maternal allele, so it is not expressed<br />When is methylated,  the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binded to insulator element  and thus IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele.<br />Wilm's tumour loss of imprinting is brought on by hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele . you also have expression of Igf2 too  so now you have a double dose of Igf2.And Igf2 is a growth promoting gene  and this is because it is associated with cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>

<p>Decitabine is  kind of very similar to 5-Azacytidine.<br />They've just had additional modifications , so they're all nucleoside analogs. So they get incorporated into the DNA during the replication<br />Upon replication, an when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, that is to say  the DNMT1 comes along to bind nucleotide to then copy the methylation to the daughter strand and because of that kind of modification the DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly and it can no longer be released.<br />DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so you have to have the cell replicating. this means that cancer cells which are<br />dividing much more rapidly than most the cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.           <br /><br /> They're actually very good at getting rid of cancer. And that's because you're acting in  the range in which they cause DNA demethylation.<br />So,that is able to lock one way of  being causing DNA methylation,<br /><br /></p>
