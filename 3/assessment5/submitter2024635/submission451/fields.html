    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, promoter-associated CpG islands (CPI) are unmethylated. Distinct subsets of CPI become hypermethylated in cancer. These subsets appear to differ between cancer types as well as between different stages of each cancer. When they are methylated, the genes they control are silenced. Since these are often tumor suppressor genes, the result is removal of the controls normally placed on cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, adhesiveness, and lifespan. Such epimutations produce cells with a growth advantage and are, therefore, selected for.  </p>
<p>In normal cells, repetitive elements and CpG-poor promoters in intergenic regions are methylated. In cancer, both often become unmethylated. This activates the genes they control. The CpG promoters in intergenic regions often code for cryptic transcription start sites that can disrupt neighboring genes, leading to aberrant protein production. They may also promote oncogenes, leading to cancer even more directly. When repetitive elements are activated, they cause genomic instability, lwith consequent reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions, activation of crptic promoters, disruption of coding, &amp;/or activation of the wrong genes. </p>
<p>Thus, in cancer we find overall global hypomethylation while also finding subsets of abnormally hypermethylated CPI. The effects of such altered methylation depend on the malignancy. If the cancer is driven by oncogenes or activated transposons, then DNA hypomethylation promotes it. If it is driven by repression of tumor suppressor function, then DNA hypermethylation promotes it.</p>
<p>One other common finding in cancer is decreased function of DNMT1 in the tissue of origin of the malignancy. This leads to DNA hypomethylation, presumably contributing to the global hypomethylation seen. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2/HP19 cluster of genes consists of an imprint control region (ICR) sitting between Igf2 (a growth promoting oncogene) &amp; H19 with enhancers located just beyond H19. The maternal allele’s ICR should be unmethylated. That allows CTCF, an insulator protein, to bind to the ICR, blocking access of the enhancers to Igf2. In that case, the enhancers increase H19’s function. The paternal allele should have a methylated ICR. This blocks CTCF binding. Without CTCF, the enhancers are allowed access to Igf2, increasing its function. The result of having two methylated ICRs for this gene cluster (as in uniparental disomy, Beckwith-Weideman syndrome, mutation of the maternal allele, or an epigenetic mutation that silences the maternal ICR) is a double dose of Igf's protein, insulin-like growth factor, &amp;, thus, excessive promotion of growth, a key component of cancer.</p>
<p>In some children with Wilm’s tumor, the Igf2/H19 ICR of both alleles is hypermethylated. This means CTCF cannot bind, &amp; both alleles have an activated growth promoting Igf2 region. This leads to overgrowth of immature kidney cells &amp;, subsequently, cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a cytosine analog, is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It gets incorporated into DNA in lieu of cytosine and irreversibly binds DNMT, thus blocking methylation of the new DNA strand during replication. By passively diluting out DNA methylation with each replication cycle as well as lowering the amount of DNMT available for maintenance of DNA methylation with each replication cycle, it allows re-expression of tumor suppressor genes with consequent return of normal cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis in myelodysplastic syndromes..at least temporarily. (The average duration of such a response to the drug is seven months.)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation changes of promoters/enhancers alter the function of the genes each controls (See Q.1). The changes are mitotically heritable, thanks to DNMT1. This is probably the main reason drugs affecting DNA methylation may produce effects lasting beyond their treatment period. Such epimutations almost certainly also change the nuclear architecture with newly hypermethylated areas (therefore, heterochromatin) locating near the nuclear lamina &amp; hypomethylated areas (euchromatin) tending toward the nuclear center This could change the neighboring chromatin, affecting potential chromosome interactions (eg, possible reciprocal translocations) as well as contributing to the long range epigenetic silencing/activation that facilitates many malignancies and may also alter their response to therapy.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time during which changes in the environment may affect the epigenome. Such periods include embryogenesis and primordial germ cell development. Clearly, giving drugs affecting DNA methylation during such periods could cause both genomic and epigenomic abnormalities in the embryo or maturing germ cells (the latter, of both the parents &amp; the developing embryo). In addition, with respect to epigenetic drugs, the somatic epigenomes of children may change in such a way that adverse long-term effects could occur (as with susceptibility to cancer years after radiation).</p></div>
