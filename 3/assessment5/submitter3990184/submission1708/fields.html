    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a disease that is driven by epigenetic and genetic alterations. In cancer, one problem is alterations in the epigenetic machinery in cells of a human. The epigenetic machinery is correlated with places of DNA methylation in a human cell. One of the most important DNA methylation regions are the CpG islands. CpG islands can be found in promotor regions prior to a gene, where they are mostly unmethylated. However, in cancer cells CpG Islands get hypermethylated. Because of the hypermethylation of CpG islands, genes get silenced and will no longer be expressed. In this way a certain amount of tumor suppressor genes get silenced by hypermethylation. This will lead to invasive growth of the cancer cells into the human body. On tissue level you see that normal tissue will change to hyperplastic cells, to neoplastic cells and finally to invasive cells. The amount of hypermethylation of CpG islands will grow at every stage and will cause more disruption of genes.</p>
<p>In a healthy human cell most of the non-coding intergenic regions and repetitive elements on the genome are hypermethylated. The hypermethylation is needed to obtain genomic stability of the DNA. On the other hand, in cancer cells there will be a genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Genomic instability will be the main problem of the newly formed hypomethylation regions. In this way the cancer cells can create mutations in the genome. Mutations in chromatin modifying enzymes will cause more DNA methylation and more silencing of genes that aren’t important for the growth of the cancer. However, the mutations will also lead to the suppression of the defense mechanism of the human cells. Tumor suppressor genes will be silenced and the tumorgenesis throughout the tissue will continue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting can cause expression of the methylation pattern of both the paternal allel and the maternal allel. When a tumor mutates, the methylation pattern of an allel can change; the paternal allel can change to a maternal allel or vice versa. This leads to a loss or gain of function of the genes on the allel. If the allel contains a tumor suppressor gene, the mutation can lead to suppression of this gene (resulting in cancercells). A disease in which the methylation is changed on the maternal allel is Wilm’s tumour. In this tumour the H19/lgf2 cluster Igf2 allele is activated on the maternal allel. This biallelic expression of the Igf2 will be the cause of the somatic overgrowth in the kidney cells, resulting in tumours. The Igf2 protein plays an essential role in growth and development in the embryonic stage. Normally  the maternal allel in the embryonic stage contains a hypomethylated promotor that is blocked by CTCF. The H19 gene transcription enhancers promote H19 and recruit CTCF that insulates Igf2. Therefor the H19 gene can only be expressed downstream. On the paternal strain the promoter isn’t blocked by a CTCF, therefor the enhancers can express Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Low doses of Decibatine have a positive effect on malignant diseases like acute/chronic myelogenous leukemia. Decibatine belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. Decitabine incorporates itself into cellular DNA and has an anti-neoplastic effect on cancercells. It has a DNA demethylation function in the genome when it binds to the DNMT and blocks the DMNT after the next transcription. This result in hypomethylation of daughter DNA strands following replication. It can eventually reactivate tumor suppressor genes that have been silenced by hypermethylation caused by cancercells. As well as the anti-tumour effect of Decibatine, the medicine also activates the expression of tumor associated antigens. T-cells will recognize cancer antigens and produce cytotoxicT-cells that eliminate cancercells. Finally, Decibatine also effects activation of apoptotic pathways which reduce the telomerase activity resulting in demethylation of the human telomerase catalytic subunitpromotor, which lowers the telomerase activity in the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many epigenetic drugs that have been discovered can alter methylation patterns on the DNA or modify histones. The use of epigenetic drugs is sometimes needed to make patients more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. However, patients can only use these epigenetic drugs in the sensitive periods of predominantly establishment of epigenetic marks. The sensitive period in the human cells are critical times for reorganising epigenetic marks in gametes/fertilised eggs/blastocysts/epiblasts and primordial germ cells. When epigenetic drugs are given, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the gametes is also possible in the sensitive period. The drugs also alter the chromosome structure which increases genomic instability in the human healthy cells. Another side effect of epigenetic drugs administered in the sensitive period is an increased mutation rate in regions with heterochromatin. This causes more genomic instability and deregulation of imprinted genes. It is therefore advisable to not administer epigenetic drugs in the sensitive periods of development. On the other hand when the cells are in a state of somatic maintenance, epigenetic drugs can be very helpful for treatment of cancers like acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The epigenetic medicine Decitabine can be used for AML and CML. </p></div>
