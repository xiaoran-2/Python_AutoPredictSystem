    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) of the cluster is methylated. This means that the insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to the ICR and prevent the enhancers that are downstream of both the IGF2 gene and the H19 gene from acting on the IGF2 gene. The enhancers work to promote the expression of the growth promoting IGF2. As the ICR is methylated, the methylation spreads downstream to affect the promoter of the H19 gene and repress the expression of the growth restricting gene.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated thus allowing for the binding of CTCF and the prevention of the downstream enhancers working on the IGF2 gene and promoting growth. As a result the enhancers work on the H19 gene and promote expression of the H19 gene and restrict growth.</p>
<p>However, in Wilm’s tumour, the maternal allele is hypermethlated resulting in the expression of IGF2 and the repression in expression of H19 from the maternal allele. Compared to normal cells, these cells have double the expression of the growth promoting IGF2 gene. This overexpression is a disruption in imprinting that may lead to proliferative cell division and stimulate the growth of tumours whilst also preventing damaged cells from being destroyed thus contributing to diseases such as Wilm’s tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions that are dense in C-G dinucleotides and are most commonly found at the promoters of tumour suppressors. In normal cells, these CpG islands are hypomethlated so that the tumour suppressor genes are activated to regulate the cell cycle in order to avoid the potential progression into a cancerous state. However, in cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated meaning that the tumour suppressor genes are no longer expressed and cannot carry out their function. As a result proliferative cell division can occur, increasing the likelihood mutations occurring and causing a cancer. As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable in that these marks will be passed on from the parent cell to daughter cells and tumour suppressor genes will be silenced in following cells causing the progression of the cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements to maintain genomic stability by preventing irregular gene expression and decreasing the likelihood of genetic mutations such as illegitimate recombinations, deletions and insertions in chromosomes that can cause cancer from occurring. In cancer, there is global hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements. Unmethylation  of intergenic regions may cause transcriptional interference as a result of the transcription of two genes toward one another resulting in a shortened transcript that can affect cellular processes and thus genomic stability leading to mutations. The repetitive elements are activated as a result of hypomethlation, causing  the copying and pasting of themselves around the genome. This may cause the potential disruption of coding regions in other genes or promoting the activation of neighbouring genes that shouldn’t be activated due to the strong promoters of the elements. Unmethylation of the repeats can cause incorrect recombination between repeats. This results in an increase in genomic instability which can lead to mutations that could cause a cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methlytransferase inhibitor. Its objective is to reduce hypermethylation that may be caused by an enzyme such as EZH2 being overactive and thus causing the promoters of growth suppressor genes to be silenced. This silencing means that the cell cycle is not properly regulated leading to the possibility of mutations and the promoting of cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine reduces the hypermethlation to reactivate the tumour suppressor genes (especially in <span>myelodysplastic syndromes)</span> by irreversibly binding to the DNA Methyltransferase (DNMT) so that the DNMT is unable to methylate the daugter cells. As replication occurs proliferatively in cancer, the methylation of future cells is affected. Without the hypermethylation, the tumour suppressor genes work to regain control of cell division and stop the spread of the cancer. When given at low doses,</p>
<p>Decitabine appears to have an anti-neoplastic effect. This drug has an anti-tumour effect (effective in treatment of heamatological malignancies) as it can stop the spreading of cancer and also kill the cancerous cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can affect the epigenome as proper gene expression levels could be changed leading to implications for the development and processes occurring within an organism. A sensitive period is defined as the time when epigenetic marks are removed so that there can be re-expression of certain genes to ensure totipotency of a developing zygote. During  the first sensitive period, the pre implantation period the maternal and paternal genomes have the removal and resetting of DNA methylation whilst the repeats and imprinted genes maintain DNA methylation. During germ cell development,  the second sensitive period, the somatic cells maintain their methylation whilst the germ cells of the developing organism undergo demethylation and remethylation along with the imprinted genes.</p>
<p>Treating a patient at such a time is inadvisable as that would mean the reprogramming in the developing organism is interfered with. The drug can work on the developing organism’s cells so that either proper removal or resetting cannot of the marks occurs. This can lead to misexpression of certain genes in the developing organism leading to the inhibition of proper development and its consequences. The mitotic heritability of DNA methylation means that if the marks in a particular cell are affected by the action of the drug, this cell will produce more cells that with the inherent mark. </p></div>
