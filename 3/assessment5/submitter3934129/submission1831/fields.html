    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands of promoters in the normal cells appear to be less methylated (or even unmethylated) than the corresponding ones in cancer cells. The methylation of the CpG islands implies the silencing of the genes (in other words, the genes are not expressed). The DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer; that epigenetic abnormality is known as CpG hypermethylation. The result of the CpG hypermethylation is the silencing of tumour suppressor genes and consequently, the cancer progress is less hindered (than in the case that the tumour suppressor genes were expressed).</p>
<p>The normal cells have methylated introns, integenic regions and repetitive elements of their genes in contrast to the cancer cells, where the aforementioned regions seem to be epigenetically abnormal, being unmethylated.That epigenetic aberration is known as hypomethylation genome-wide. In that case, the methylation of these regions contribute decisively to the genomic stability. Hence, the hypomethylation results in a less dense DNA packing and allows for mutations, such as reciprocal translocations and deletions, whic lead to subsequent genomic instability. More specifically, the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters results in activation of oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The genes in ICRs (imprinted control regions) have been proven to be associated with growth. Thus, the hypo- or hyper-methylation can result in reduction of expression of growth restriction genes or in overexpression of growth promoting genes respectively.</p>
<p>One example is the loss of impinting of Igf2 due to hypermethylation of H19/Igf2 cluster. In normal cells, the Igf2 expression is monoallelic.  More specifically, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF insulator protein to get bound. Consequently, the enhancers act upon the H19, which is expressed and not upon the Igf2, which is silenced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, preventing CTCF from getting bound; so it spreads to H19 (which is also silenced) andallowing the enhancers to act upon Igf2,which gets activated.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of the aforementioned imprinting due to methylation of both ICRs (in both alleles). CTCF is not allowed to get bound, silencing of H19 is followed and activation of Igf2 by the enhancers in both alleles. As a result, the growth promoting gene Igf2 is overexpressed, contributing to tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (DNMTi); in other words, decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent by inhibiting the action of DNMT. More specifically, decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by being embodied into the DNA upon its replication and binding irreversibly with the, subsequently upcoming, DNA methyl-transferase that can no longer be released and continue its action (to inherit the methylation to the daughter cells). Hence, genes that were aberrantly silenced in cancer cells are re-expressed, and apoptosis of cancer cells occur. Moreover, since the DNMTis are replication dependent, their effect is much more profound to the cancer cells (which proliferate with a higher rate than the normal cells).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are mitotically heritable, passing from the daughter cell to the grand-daughter cell etc; however, they are reversible. Once they are deleted, because of the use of the epigenetic drugs, they do not appear again. In that sense, altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the epigenome. Hence, the tumour stops growing and only the cancer cells should be killed. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are defined as the periods when epigenetic marks are actively remodelled rather than maintained. So, the pre- and the early- implantation stage (embryogenesis) and the primordial germ cells development (gametogenesis) are considered to be sensitive periods of development.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration all the above, we conclude that treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable, because it would end up to epigenetic modifications to all of their cells, including their germ cells. That could lead in irreversible epigenetic aberrations of germ cells and subsequently to their later children (or grand-children regarding the sensitive period) suffered from diseases.</p></div>
