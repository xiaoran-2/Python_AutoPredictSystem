    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands found in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, which are generally unmethylated in normal cells, are methylated at a high frequency in cancer cells. This results in silencing of tumor suppressor gene expression.  CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype) describes a state of unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites, and has been identified in several cancer types.  Higher levels of DNA methylation in CpG islands seems to be associated with tumor progression.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions such as repeats are normally methylated.  Methylated DNA participates in the formation of chromatin through interactions with various other epigenetic modificating species such as the histone modifying enzymes, polycomb complexes, nucleosomes, noncoding RNA, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins.  However in cancer these regions are often unmethylated, resulting in genomic instability, loss of imprinting, and reactivation of transposons and oncogene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 gene contains an imprinting control region which is usually methylated in the paternal allele, causing silencing of H19 expression and neighboring Igf2 gene expression enhancement from this allelle.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is generally unmethylated; CTCF binds the imprinting control region and acts as an insulator to silence expression of Igf2, while H19 is expressed from this allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor both the maternal and paternal copies of Igf2 are expressed.  Failure of imprinting and consequent expression or silencing of both maternal and paternal Igf2 alleles can lead to cancer or growth abnormalities.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Deciabine is a cytidine analogue.  It is incorporated into DNA and inhibits methylation.  Since cancer cells are replicating quickly as compared to normal cells, it would be expected to be incorporated into the cancer cell genome, replacing the methylated cytosine. As methylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters is reduced, expression could have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have an enduring effect since methylation is mitotically inherited.  Progeny cells will maintain the methylation pattern.  During the sensitive periods of germ cell development and early embryogenesis, methylation marks are reprogrammed.  New methylation patterns set up during these periods will have lasting effects on development and growth.  Treatment with drugs which alter that pattern is inadvisable since long term aberrant consequences could result.</p></div>
