    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is one of the properties of the nuclear material that is altered in cancer.  DNA methylation of some CpG dinucleotides is normal and is the modification of the Cytosine (C) molecule by the enzymatic addition of a methyl group in the 5 position.  Which CpG dinucleotides are methylated in the normal cell nucleus is subject to an exquisite level of control - a process which is disturbed as a cell progresses along the path to becoming cancerous.</span></p>
<p><span>In the sequence of bases that make up the generic code there are many sequence motifs.  One of these are runs of many CpG dinucleotides.  Islands such as these are are hypo-methlyated, as such they tend to maintain an open chromatin state, allowing access for the cellular machinery and tend to sit at the promoters of genes.  Other CpG dinucleotides tending to be hyper-methylated  occur in intergenic regions (acting as markers for exon boundaries), within repetitive elements, such as the LTRs of IAPs, here silencing expression from cryptic promoters and contributing to genomic stability by disabling transposable elements.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cell progresses towards cancer, many changes take place: Cytosine molecules in CpG islands and island shores tend to become and then remain methylated.  This as a rule silences the gene involved by adoption of a repressive chromatin structure and allowing binding of MeCP1 and 2 and, as a proportion of these normally have tumour suppressing actions a selective advantage for cancer is set up.  Secondly CpG dinucleotides in repeat regions are hypo-methylated, this has the effect of raising the level of genomic instability as these repeats are often transposon derived and now find they have restored functionality.  Now very many genes may be miss-expressed and gross chromosomal changes are free to take place.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The Igf2/H19 cluster is a region of chromosome 11 that is subject to imprinting - that is differential expression patterns for the maternally and paternally derived alleles.</span></p>
<p><span>In normal cells, the paternal allele shows methylation at an imprint control region (ICR) and at the promoter for H19.  The mode of action of this region is such that this methylation results in the silencing of H19 and the enhancement of expression of Igf2.  The maternal allele in contrast is hypo-methylated at these regions and in consequence, through binding of a CTCF protein drives transcription enhancement of maternal H19 and no maternal transcription of Igf2.</span></p>
<p><span>Wilm’s tumour shows disrupted methylation, such that the maternal allele is also hyper-methylated at the ICR and H19 promoter.  This silences the expression of the tumour suppressor gene H19, and by a lack of binding of CTCF to the ICR, allows enhancement of expression of the ocogene Igf2 from the maternal allele which to all intents and purposes is now acting like a second paternal allele.  The net result is to promote growth, favouring Wilm’s tumour formation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is one of a class of DNA-demethylating agents and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a cytidine analog that exercises it’s effect by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases, presumably it has it’s anti-tumour effect by reversing the silencing of tumour suppression gene expression.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have lasting effects because the methylation state once altered is metastable, in that on cell division, it is preserved in both daughter cells (by the action of DNMT1).  It follows therefore that whatever pattern of gene expression results from the altered methylation state is also preserved in both daughter cells.</span></p>
<p><span>Caution in the use of drugs would be advised however because there are periods in the organisms life cycle when wholesale resetting of DNA methylation state is taking place.  In mammals these sensitive periods are during early embryogenesis up to the blastula stage (when there is a global low in DNA methylation) and slightly later as lineage specific marks are laid down and for the germ cells at least, much later when the primordial germ cells are developing and parental epigenetic marks are being laid down.</span></p></div>
