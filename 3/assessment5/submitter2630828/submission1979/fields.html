    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">CpG islands (CGIs) are clusters of cytosine-guanine dinucelotides in the genome. Often found near gene promoters, if a CGI is methylated then the DNA transcription machinery is blocked from the nearby promoter and the gene is silenced.  With the exception of the inactive X chromosome and some genes related to tissue differentiation, CGIs are normally protected from methylation.  Regions surrounding CGIs are known as CGI shores and methylation of these shores contributes to tissue differentiation.</p>
<p class="p1">In many types of cancer cells, CGIs or CGI shores near tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated (often due to mutations in methylation enzymes or the accumulation of CGI methylation “mistakes” with age). This CGI hypermethylation increases in extent as the tumor develops, silencing tumor suppressor genes, enabling increased cell division and tumor growth.  Tumors driven by the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes tend to divide very rapidly.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Some cancer types cause hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters, increasing a particular gene expression, which, depending on the gene, may aid in the silencing of tumor suppressors.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Much of the genome consists of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. During normal cell function, these regions are hypermethylated, constricting the regions to heterochromatin to maintain genome stability. In almost all tumor cells, these regions are hypomethylated (methyl groups removed), starting early in tumorogenesis and increasing with time.  This hypomethylation is often due to the deletion of methylation enzymes (like Dnmt) or overexpression of demethylation enzymes (like TET). Hypomethylation of repetitive elements opens their chromatin (euchromatin), enabling: reciprocal translocation between repeats on different chromosomes; illegitimate combination of chromosomes; duplication and insertion of repeats; and deletions.  This widespread genetic instability inhibits normal cell function and can, if the relevant genes are duplicated or deleted, spur further tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">In normal cell function, the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted through enhancer blocking.  </p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The maternal allele’s imprint control region is unmethylated,</strong> allowing the CTCF insulator protein to bind, blocking the downstream enhancers from Igf2 – their preferred site due to chromatin looping.  Instead, enhancers enhance expression of H19 (an unrelated non-coding RNA). Thus, Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The paternal allele’s imprint control region is methylated</strong>, blocking CTCF from binding. This methylation spreads downstream to the H19 promoters as well, silencing that gene. The downstream enhancers can then freely enhance Igf2, causing the Igf2 to be expressed on the paternal allele.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">In Wilm’s tumor cells, both the maternal and paternal imprint control regions are methylated.  Thus, both allele’s behave as the paternal allele would in a normal cell, expressing Igf2.  As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, a double dose of the gene (overexpression) causes rapid cell division and growth of kidney tumors in affected children.  Loss of imprinting often occurs before tumors emerge, suggesting a role in tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">Decitabine, a drug used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  DNMT3 establishes DNA methylation and DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation.  By targeting these epigenetic mechanisms, DNMT inhibitors attempt to reduce DNA methylation in cells.  Specifically, DNMT inbititors are incorporated into the DNA upon cell replication and then bind irreversibly to DNMTs as the proteins transfer methylation to the daughter strand of DNA.  By blocking DNMT active sites, drugs like Decitabine prevent DNA methylation from being inherited mitotically.  As hypermethylation is a hallmark of many cancers and tumor cells divide more rapidly than most cells in the body, DNMT inhibitors passively demethylate new tumor cells (as well as any other dividing cells).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">DNA methylation is inherited mitotically.  This enables skin cells to produce more skin cells, liver cells more liver cells, etc. without completely reprogramming the epigenome.  Additionally, DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation over the course of a cell’s life.  Thus, if an epigenetic drug changes the methylation in a cell or group of cells, that methylation would be maintained and passed along to new cells of that type.  It also means cells not undergoing division will be resistant to methylation reprogramming by epigenetic drugs (useful for attacking fast dividing tumors).</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">However, there are two periods of development in which most of an organism’s methylation is cleared and reset. The first, and most critical, of these sensitive periods is when primoridal germ cells first develop.  During this period all of the germ cell’s epigenome (including imprinted genes, but not repeats) is cleared and reset.  The second critical period is the early stages of pregnancy.  Before implantation, all of the epigenome except imprinted genes and repetitive elements is cleared and reset.  During these sensitive periods epigenetic drugs should be avoided, as the epigenetic machinery is more active and any interference with the epigenome will be inherited by the entire body.</p></div>
