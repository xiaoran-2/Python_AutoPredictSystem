    <div class="field-value"><p>Cytosine nucleotides are modified to 5-methylcytosine in approximately 70-80% of CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells . Methylation means that a methyl group, consisting of a carbon and three hydrogen atoms is covalently bonded to to the fifth carbon atom in the six atom ring of the cytosine molecule  This alters its physical properties, because the methyl group is now sticking out from the base.  Methylation of repetitive elements  silences them and maintains the stability of the genome, because they cannot then cause genes to be inserted at innapropriate places elsewhere in the genome.  A promoter is a region of a gene where transcription starts. This means that RNA polymerase can start making a copy of the DNA from this point. However it is unusual to find methylated CpG islands at the promoters of genes.  Methylation at a promoter CpG island would cause transcriptional silencing by binding methylated CpG binding proteins which are then able to recruit other factors which condense the chromatin, making the gene less accessible to transcription. Furthermore, binding of transcription factors would also be inhibited  CpG islands at promoters are normally kept unmethylated. In the case that methylation does occur at a promoter CpG island , the gene downstream of the promoter will be silenced,  because transcription factor binding is inhibited. In cancer, promoters tend to be hypomethylated, while the gene itself, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hyperrmethylated, the exact reverse of the situation found in normal cells. If the promoter of a tumor supressor gene is hypermethylated in this way, the gene will not then be expressed, allowing uncontrolled cell division to occur. If a growth promoting oncogene is activated, the balance between supression and activation will be altered in favour of uncontrolled mitosis.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The HG19/IGF2 cluster contains the genes for Igf2 a growth promoter, and H19, a long noncoding RNA.  The maternal allele  expresses H19, the paternal allele expresses Igf2. This is due to to methylation  of the H19 promoter on the paternal allele and methylation at the imprint control region on the same allele. This results in the expression of Igf2, owing to the ICR being unable to insulate the Igf2 gene from downstream promoters, and the silencing of H19. On the maternal allele, absence of methylation results in the expression of H19 and binding of CTCF to the imprint control region (ICR) resulting in the the Igf2 gene being accessible to downstream promoters. This gene is then expressed. The cluster is said to be imprinted because the maternal allele is distiguished from the paternal allele by heritable methylation marks. Upstream fom the Igf2H19 gene cluster is the kcnq1 cluster. It is methylated on the maternal allele, unmethylated on the paternal. In Wilms tumor  imprinting is disrupted, the methylation on the maternal allele  is removed, Igf2, a growth promoter,  is expressed on the maternal allele, and expression  of cdkn1c, a tumor supressor, is lost. Igf2 is overexpressed cdkn1 c is silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of  DNA demethylating agent and works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase,1 the enzyme responsible for attatching methyl groups to the cytosine base of DNA, and which is responsible for maintaining methylation during cell division.Disrupting this enzyme will therefore cause changes in the methylation status of the daughter cells. Given in high doses decitabine is indiscriminately toxic, but at low doses its effect on DNA methylation means that rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in haemopoetic malignancies, like myelodysplasia, will be  disproprtionately affected. Furthermore, as CpG island hypermethylation is important in myelodysplasia, inhibiting methylation will exert an anti tumor effect. This may be because methylation marks on the promoters of tumor supressor genes are removed allowing them to be re-expressed. However the demethylation effect is non-selective and may have multiple, or pleiotropic, effects. This is undesirable because anti tumor threrapy requires specificity. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Becuase DNA methylation has to be maintaned through cell division, disrupting one of the enzymes that maintain methylation will affect the methylation status of daughter cells.  Giving  a DNMTI inhibitor such as azacytidine or decitabine can therefore have a lasting effect on the epigenome by affecting the epigenetic marks that involve methylation.The effects of drugs that alter DNA methylation can therefore last beyond the period of drug treatment. Adolescence is a sensitive time because germ cells are still developing in these patients. In females, oocytes  remain unmethylated until puberty, so giving methylation- inhibiting drugs during this time would therefore be inadvisable  Because DNA methylation occurs in germ cells, giving such drugs to adolescents at a time when germ cells are developing  might affect the establishment of epigenetic marks.This is therefore called a sensitive period. Because current methylation -altering drugs such as decitibine are inhibit DNMT1 in all cells, it is quite possible that they will affect not just the methylation patterns of cancer cells but of normal cells as well, and germ cells are particularly sensitive in this respect.</p></div>
