    <div class="field-value"><p>Clusters of CpG dinucleotides are called CpG Islands. They are often found near gene promoters (at the beginning of the gene). These CpG Islands are usually unmethylated. Methylation of CpG Islands produces gene silencing.  Though generally unmethylated some CpG islands are "dynamically methylated." I.e, Methylated in some cell types and not in others depending on the need of that cell for that gene's activity.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is also important in silencing the inactive X chromosome. The fact that all the progeny of a cell with a randomly inacitvated X chormosome (in gastrulation) have the same X chormosome inactivated shows that CpG island methylation is mitotocally heritable. CpG island methylation also contributes to the formation of a repressive chromatin structure.  MeCpG can be bound by the CpG binding proteins Me CP1 &amp; 2. By attaching to the CpG island they prevent transcription (transcriptional repression domain) These proteins can also recruit other factors that condense chromatin. It is also possible for the MeCpG (without mediation fo the CP 1&amp;2) to prevent binding of transcription factors.  This is rare and occurs mainly for promoters with few CpGs. </p>
<p>Normally unmethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated in cancer. Hypermethylated CpG islands are associated with silenced genes. When they are tumor suppresor genes, their silence can contribute to cancer.Silencing of tumor suppresor genes leads to rapid growth of cancer cells. Since CpG island methylation is mitotically heritable all the progeny grow rapidly conferring a selective advantage to the cancer cells. Both single genes and sets of genes may be affected by CpG island methylation.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Their inactivation contributes to genomic stability by silencing cryptic start  and splicing sites. When these become unmethylated in cancer, deletions, reciprocal transloctions and insertions produce abnormal karyotypes.Activation of repeats produces transcriptional interference from strong promoters.   Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repeats is universal in cancer. In general, hypomethylation activates oncogenes, hypermethylation silences tumor suppressor genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR(Imprint Control Region) is methylated in the paternal allele: it is paternally imprinted.In the normal situation it is not methylated in the maternal allele.  The methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele prevents binding to that region of the CTCF insulator protein. Enhancers downstream of the H19 gene are then not blocked by the CTCF protein from activating Igf2 (a growth promoting gene). Thus the methylation of the ICR in the paternal allele promotes expression of Igf2. (This methylation also spreads to the H19 promoter region,suppressing H19 activity.) Because the maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR the CTCF can bind to it and block the promoters from the Igf2. They instead enhance expression of the H19 gene, and Igf2 is silent. There is a balance between paternal and maternal alleles.In Wilm's tumor (a cancer of the kidney in children) the ICR is methylated in both maternal and paternal alleles.  There is excessive growth promotion from the double dose of Igf2 activity. In this case hypermethylation of both maternal and paternal ICRs results in overexpression of a growth promoting gene and underexpression of growth restricitng genes, leading to tumor growth.Hypermethylation (as well as hypomethylation) of ICRs occurs early and can be detected in pre-neoplastic tissue.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is categorized as a DNA demethylating agent in the article. In the lectures as DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.The larger category DNMTi s  belong to is drugs targeting enzymatic epigenomic regulators. Decitabine operates by interfering with the activity of DNMT1.  Decitabine attaches itself to the daughter strand of replicated DNA which DNMT1 is attempting to methylate. Decitabine irreversibly binds the DNMT1 and prevents it from methylating the daughter strand.  I.e.,It interferes with replication associated methylation. Since cancer cell replicate more frequently than normal cells, it interferes more with their methylation. Heavy methylation of CpG islands is associated with certain kinds of cancer: eg, myelodysplastic syndrome which Decitabine (in low doses) seems to treat effectively. It may impede cancers of this type by interfering with continued methylation of the CpG islands. Concerns about DNMTi s relate to their general interference with methylation not restricted to cancer cells.  But older patients with myeloplastic syndrome tolerate them well in low doses and are benefitted by them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, drugs that interfere with the methylation of daughter cells can alter the character of the epigenome over time. This involves the silencing and activation of different sets of genes. Since DNA methylation is the basis for so many epigenetic phenomena (imprininting, X chromosome inactivation,formation of heterochromatin) altering it can have extensive and enduring effects.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods can be defined as times when environmental changes can have the most effect on epigentetic control-- large and enduring effects. The two specific sensitive periods occur in early embryonic developement (immeditately pre and post implantation) and during the developement of primordial germ cells. In the first case all the embryonic cells are subject to epigenomic resetting (demethylation); in the second only the primordial germ cells. In early embryonic develpement the paternal and maternal epigenomes are reset (except for repeats and imprinted genes) during PGC developement only repeats are exempt from demethylation. The devolopement of PGCs extends to puberty; treatment during that period has the potential to create epigenomic alterations that could be transmitted across generations. It is for that reason inadvisable. Pregnant mothers whose babies are in a sensitive period are subject to the same stricture.</p></div>
