    <div class="field-value"><p>. DNA Methylation turns off gene expression. It maintains genomic stability by preventing illegitimate recombinations , additions and deletions. It is essential for viability: mice with DNMT1 removed die in utero.</p>
<p>In cancer, methylation increases at CPG islands and decreases (hypomethylation) in the rest of the genome including repetitive elements, intergenic regions, imprint control regions and genes. In CPG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP) tumours methylation levels are very high i.e. Colorectal cancer, Glioma and Neuroblastoma. Changes in methylation occur through genetic mutations but more commonly through epigenetic mistakes. Methylation caused by genetic mutations is mitotically heritable but if caused by an epigenetic mistake is reversible. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation progress over time and happen in the early stages of cancer.</p>
<p>In normal cells CPG Islands contain the promoters and genes essential for cell function so are not methylated  and are expressed. The inactive genes they also contain are methylated to ensure they are not expressed.  Different cell types have different methylation patterns to ensure the correct proteins are expressed to maintain cell function.</p>
<p>In cancer, the methylation of CPG islands causes tumour suppressor gene promoters to become silenced. The hypermethylation pattern of a CPG island varies by tumour. Colorectal cancer is caused by inactivation of MLH1 by either genetic mutation or epigenetic methylation of the CPG island promoter. Many  breast cancers are caused by mutation or hypermethylation of BRCA1 or BRCA2.</p>
<p>Normally, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are methylated and they maintain genetic stability as dense chromatin (heterochromatin) does not allow recombination and gene transposition.</p>
<p>In cancer, repeat and intergenic regions become hypomethylated and the consequences depend on their location. Hypomethylation leads to genetic instability as it produces open chromatin (euchromatin) that allows:  activiation of repeats, transpositions, insertions, deletions, illegitimate recombinations, activation of neighbouring and transcriptional interference from strong promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer many Imprint Control Regions become hypermethylated and this causes loss of imprinting, which is an early event in cancer. Genes that should display just one allele from either the mother or father don't. Instead they express both alleles or both alleles are silenced. In Wilm's Tumour, a childhood kidney cancer both alleles are expressed.</p>
<p>Normally, on the Igf2/H19 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allele is unmethylated. So in the paternal allele the enhancers act on the Igf2 because the CTCF (insulator protein) does not bind to it and Igf2 is expressed. And in the maternal allele the CTCF is binding and the enhancers act on H19 promoter instead and Igf2 is not expressed. DNA methylation controls the expression of Igf2 and H19 by preventing the binding of the insulator protein, CTCF.</p>
<p>In cancerous cells, the maternal allele become methylated as well so maternal and paternal alleles are the same and there is a double dose of Igf2. Since Igf2 is growth promoting it leads to Wilm's Tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (Dacogen) is a DNA demethylating drug/hypomethylation agent that is one of two on the market. It has been used to treat Myelodysplastic Syndromes the precursors to Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia (AML). Treatment with Decitabine means AML is less likely.</p>
<p>In Myleodysplastic syndromes the blood cells (white/red/platelets) are mis-shapen due to hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, leading to their silencing. When the  tumour suppressor genes are methylated they can't  prevent mutated/damaged cells from dividing and cancerous tumours result.  Decitabine demethylates by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and has proved effective as once methylation is removed the bone marrow can produce normal blood cells and tumour suppressor genes are switched on to remove mutated/damaged cells. Decitabine also removes damaged blood cells and stops them from continuing to divide and form tumours. Decitabine is incorporated into DNA upon replication as its inhibition is dependent on the cell replicating.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Stephen Baylin came to this conclusion when he found that a number of patients with advanced lung cancer didn't show much response to a combination of epigenetic drugs (Histone deacetylase inhibitor and Azactidine (a demethylating agent)) but did respond to standard chemotherapy drugs afterwards.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs may have a lasting effect for several reasons. Firstly, they are passed on during cell division to daughter  and even grand daughter cells. Secondly, epigenetic therapies don't just kill the cancer cells, unlike standard chemotherapy they reset DNA methylation. They may also effect the structure of chromatin which can have long term side effects. Demethylation drugs inhibit the DNA methyltransferase in replicating cells and since most cells replicate they could also be affected.</p>
<p>Scientists are cautious about using such drugs on young patients as they are unsure of the long term health consequences but in the elderly this is not such a concern. Young cancer patients don't just have the rest of their lives ahead of them but are developing germ cells and treatment could impact future generations as developing embryos are in an especially sensitive period of development.</p></div>
