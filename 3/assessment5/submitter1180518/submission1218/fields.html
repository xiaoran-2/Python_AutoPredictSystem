    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark which means the addition of a methyl group exclusively to CpG dinucleotides. There are 2 sites where DNA methylation occurs: in CpG islands existing in the promoter of the gene and in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, CpG islands tend to be protected from metylation. However, if it happens that CpG islands are methylated this causes gene silencing. This happens with unexpressed genes. However, DNA methylation usually occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Methylation in intergenic regions serves an important function which is maintaining genomic integrity and stability otherwise chromosomal insertions, deletions and duplication occur.  Also, it silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites.  Methylation of repetitive elements also maintains genomic integrity through silencing of repeats preventing transposition and avoiding transcription interference from strong promoters. In cancer, DNA hypermethylation occurs in CpG islands causing gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes. On the other hand, DNA hypomethylation occurs for intergenic regions and repetitive elements leading to genomic instability where illegitimate recombinations occur and transposition activation and cryptic promoter activation with the disruption if neigbouring genes. Different tumors have different dependencies some are driven by tumor suppressor hypermethylation others are driven by DNA hypomethylation and genomic instability. Also, the tumor dependency differs by tumor stage.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the paternal allele is methylated this methylation spreads to <em>H19</em> promoter to silence and enhancers can access <em>Igf2 </em>to activate. However the maternal allele is not methylated in the ICR this allows for the binding of an insulator protein CTCF which allows the enhancers to actiavate the expression of <em>Igf2</em>, the growth promoting oncogene. In Wilm’s tumor, loss of imprinting in this cluster involves hypomethlation of the ICR on the paternal allele leading to loss of expression of growth restriction gene “<em>H19”</em> and overexpression of growth promoting gene “<em>Igf2</em>”.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to DNA demethylating agents. It is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation. Since DNA methylation is a reversible process, decitabine can induce functional re-expression of aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes in cancer, causing growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. Maintenance therapy with decitabine may be necessary to ensure continued transcriptional derepression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. This is possible as epigenetic changes as DNA methylation are mitotically heritable and passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once such epigenetic marks are erased they don’t return. Thus, it might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells which in turn may help standard chemotherapy in controlling the tumor. Sensitive periods are periods where epigenetic reprogramming occurs. These periods involve early embryonic development and primordial germ cells development. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as this would disrupt the development of the normal epigenetic marks in the developing embryo or even the future generations if treatment occurs for younger patients in periods where development of germ cells occur.</p></div>
