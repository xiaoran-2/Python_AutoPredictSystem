    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The "normal" CpG methylation is generally inverted in cells that become tumorigenic. In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated. Hypermethylation in gene promotor cells can result in silencing those genes. This type of mutation can be dangerous as this leads to tumorigenesis. Hypermethylation is generally associated with gene inactivation.</p>
<p>CpG islands are generally unmethylated. Intergenetic regions are usually always methylated and so too are repetitive elements. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. In cancers you tend to see DNA methylation that has been hypomethylated meaning there is a decrease in the epigenetic methylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions causes genomic instability by deleting, incerting, duplicating and translocating cells. At repetitive elements, cells tend to be silenced. When DNA methylation is disrupted this can cause genetic mutations in a cell to transform into cancer. Cancer such as prostate cancer has been associated with gene silencing by CpG island hypermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted H19/Igf2cluster plays a major role in regulating cell growth and differentation and is important in placental growth.</p>
<p>The IGF2 promoter is not methylated on the maternal chromosome however upsteam on the H19 promoter is a differentially methylated region that when deleted reactivates IGF2 on the maternal chromosome. This region is also called the imprinting control region (ICR). On the paternal chromosome the ICR is methylated and the enhancers act on the IGF2 promoter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wilms tumour is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children. It is known that individuals suffering from Wilms tumours have H19/Igf2 imprinting defects. It appears that children suffereing from Wilms tumour have a chromosome with the imprinting defect which has been derived from either the maternal grandfather or maternal grandmother and methylated-imprinting defects can result from inherited mutations.</p>
<p>Normal development requires accurate expression however many discorders can be attributed to an abnormally high dose of IGF2 caused by loss of imprinting. Overall disrupted imprinting could be the most common observation in cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxyctidine) is an epigenetic modifer that hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It reactivates genes otherwise suppressed by DNA promoter methylation. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands.</p>
<p>It is currently used to treat myeldysplastic syndrome (MDS - diseases of the bone marrow) acute myeliod leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).</p>
<p>Decitabine can rectivate tumor supressor genes silenced by aberrant DNA methylation. As this epigenetic change is reversible, decitabine reacts well. Decitabine works by having a toxic effect on abnormal cells which promotes normal specialisation and blood cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are modifiactions of DNA, which occur without any alteration in the underlying DNA sequesnce. Every cell in our body has the same DNA sequence but different genes are turned on or off to make different tissues. Changes can also occur due to the environment and lead to differences in individual characteristics.</p>
<p>The sensitive period relates to important periods of childhood development. Many studies have shown that things that occur in early childhood can persist through multiple generations, being passed on from grandparents to grandchildren. For example maternal prenantal stress, caused by violence from a partner, promotes epigenetic changes in the DNA in the blood of their adolescent children.</p>
<p>If patients are treated during sensitive periods they will most likely cope well and be fine. It is when they begin to have children and their children have children that we will begin to see epigenetic changes occurring.</p>
