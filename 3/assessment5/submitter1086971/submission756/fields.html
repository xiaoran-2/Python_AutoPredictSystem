    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often found at the promoters of genes and are normally not methylated. Methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression. In cancer certain CpG islands and island shores are hypermethylyated usually in conjunction with  hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. Hypermethylated CpG islands are often found at particular sets of genes that differ by tumor type. Hypermethylated CpG islands at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes cause silencing of these genes and increased tumorogenesis.</p>
<p> <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated which maintains genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start and splice sites, silencing of repeats to prevent transposing elements, transcriptional interference and illegitamite recombination. In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are often hypomethylated leading to genomic instability, which in turn can cause illegitamite recombination, translocations, insertions and deletions thereby enhancing tumorigenesis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting achieves monoallelic gene expression without changing the DNA sequence through an epigenetic process involving DNA methylation and histone modulation.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated, preventing the insulator protein CTCF  to bind which spreads DNA methylation to the H19 promotor silencing H19 and allowing enhancers to activate Igf2. In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated which allows CTCF to bind and stop downstream enhancers from activating Igf2. The maternal allele is the imprinted allele and is silenced (Igf2 is repressed). Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome occurs when the maternal allele behaves likes the paternal allele causing over expression of Igf2 which leads to overgrowth and can cause tumors particularly in children. Kidney tumors known as Wilm’s tumor are a hallmark of Beckwith Wiedmann syndrome.  Overexpression of Igf2 can also occur in cases of parental disomy or having two copies of one parental chromosome, a mutation or deletion that causes a loss of imprinting or rarely an epigenetic disruption causing the loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors that are DNA-demethylating agents and used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) which prevents the laying down of methyl groups.  DNMTIs irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated in DNA and are replication dependent. so theoretically will affect rapidly replicating cancer cells at a higher rate than normal cells. This can have an anti-tumor effect if the DNMTi prevents or reverses DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes causing these genes to be activated slowing down the replication of cells in a rapidly growing tumor. At low doses, Decitabine demethylates DNA by mechanisms that are still unknown. It is known that at high doses, Decitabine is toxic and nonspecific.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects lasting beyond the period of drug development because DNA methylation  and epigenetic changes in general, are mitotically heritable. These changes will theoretically be passed to daughter cells every time a cell divides thus proliferating the effect of the drug.</p>
<p> <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">A sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming particularly during early development, just after fertilization and primordial germ cell development.</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Treating cancer patients during a sensitive period can have broader, unintended consequences on the epigenome as a whole.  For example, during a period when epigenetic marks are being laid down and a drug that causes DNA demethylation is given then these marks may not be properly laid down.  It would be inadvisable to treat  pregnant women and young children as they may be in a sensitive period of development.</span></p></div>
