    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues.In normal cells,CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated.</p>
<p>CpG island methylation is important in regulation of gene expression. Cytosine methylation can lead directly to destabilizing genetic mutations and a precancerous cellular state. Methylated cytosines make hydrolysis of the amine group and spontaneous conversion to thymine more favorable. They can cause aberrant recruitment of chromatin proteins. Cytosine methylations change the amount of UV light absorption of the nucleotide base, creating pyrimidine dimers. When mutation results in loss of heterozygosity at tumor suppressor gene sites, these genes may become inactive. Single base pair mutations during replication can lead to cancer and other detrimental diseases.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prostate cancer has been associated with gene silencing by CpG island hypermethylation. The GSTP1 gene has been found to defend prostate cells against genomic damage that is caused by different oxidants or carcinogens. Silencing of this gene will permit genetic damage to the prostate by oxidants and carcinogens. Methylation of cytosines within a CpG island is a causative factor in gene silencing. Modern epigenetics have correlated CpG island hypermethylation with unexpressed genes. Intergenic regions contain functionally important elements such as promoters and enhancers and are thought to have regulatory functions. This is necessary to maintain genomic integrity and stability.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are thought to maintain genomic integrity. Silence of repeats prevents transposition and to avoid transcriptional interference. Also to prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer it was found that there was hypo methylation at intragenic regions/repeats and hence genomic instability.</p>
<p>This also causes aberrations in epigenetic control and leads to cancer and other diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted alleles are silenced such that the genes are expressed only from the nonimprinted allele inherited from the mother (H19) or in other instances from the non imprinted allele from the father (Igf2). This is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone modulation in order to achieve mono allelic gene expression without altering genetic sequence.</p>
<p>Wilms' tumour is a type of embryonic kidney cancer that is associated with the <em>IGF2</em>/<em>H19</em> locus on chromosome 11. <em>H19</em> is a noncoding RNA of unknown function with properties that can suppress growth. <em>IGF2</em> codes for insulin-like growth factor 2, a growth factor highly expressed in many types of tumours. These two genes are both imprinted, and normally, only the maternal copy of <em>H19</em> and the paternal copy of <em>IGF2</em> are expressed (Steenman <em>et al.</em>, 1994). In cancer cells, however, both <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2</em> typically lose their imprinting (Moulton <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Steenman <em>et al.</em>, 1994). Scientists hypothesize that if the function of <em>H19</em> is to turn off <em>IGF2</em> expression, then the loss of <em>H19</em> expression could result in over expression of <em>IGF2</em>, thus leading to tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the drugs, called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). It  works by turning on genes that suppress cancer development. It hypomethelates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferese. In patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), these genes are often silenced by the attachment of chemicals called methyl groups to the DNA backbone of the gene (an epigenetic modification made through a process called methylation), and DNMTi prevent methyl group attachment to DNA.</p>
<p>Decitabine irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It is believed that Haematological malignancies  are dependent on tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation and hence any treatment by Decitabine for MDS will have an anti tumour effect.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In the case of treatment with epigenetic drugs the changes (DNA methylation) made are passed on during cell division to daughter cells and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased they do not return. It might therefore be possible that these therapies can efect changes which stop cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.(as in the case of GSK 2816126).</li>
<li>Sensitive period: This is the period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks.</li>
<li>During this period the pre-implantation development and primodial germ cell development takes place.</li>
<li>The concept behind epigenetic treatment is to “reprogram” the network of  chemical changes that affect the DNA of cancer cells.  This  reprogramming can alter the activity of critical genes in cancer cells that  drive their growth and survival. The treatments, can effectively  reset DNA methylation.</li>
</ul><p>       It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as it could conflict with the natural reprogramming that is being implemented by the cell during the sensitive period.</p>
