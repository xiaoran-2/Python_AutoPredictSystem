    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with mitotically x inactivation heritability."generally DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression, however, exceptions are CpG islands, ... high Cp G density are usually free of methylation". There is geomic stability.</p>
<p>In contrast if CpG islands are hyper-methylated this is associatied with gene silencing of tumor suppressor genes. "The knudson hypothesis' states cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA'. DNA methylation is one of the hits, you need to take out both copies of tumour suppresor  and also activate an oncogene. Many hits so the cell goes on to form a tumour rather than dying. DNA methylation and gene silencing can be one of these hits. Many hall-mark features assoc., displayed identification of  ...tumour type...CGI methylation progresses with time.  </p>
<p>Disruptions and alterations of their normal counterpart in comparison  genomic instability , tissue specifity and imprinted genes and also what was noticed was a high frequency of Cp G  sites  named 'CIMP" of high DNA methylation and this was first identified in 'colectral cancer.  biomarkers can lead to identification of disease type; differentation of a cancer cell from normal cell;  so a diagnosis; and prognosis  and to monitor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methyation of repetitive elements helps maintain genomic integrity by preventing illigitimate recombinations.  In cancer repetive elements are hypo methylated and no longer densely packaged into heterochromatin.  Hypo methylation of repeats at intergenic regions ; illegitimate recomination between repeats; activation of promotors and disruption to neighbouring genes. (Avy and Axinfu alleles)</p>
<p>DNMT 1 in specific tissues increases genomic instability ... human disease mutations driven by tumour suppressor  genes; like mutation at the DNMT 3b and specific tissues causing chromosmal instability; loss of imprinting at ICR. Biomarkers (sets) to identifiy tumour type; Prognosis and monitor of tumor cell type.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele  on the ICR region is methylated and no CTCF binding and so the  enhancers target the Igf2 which is only expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The ICR is  unmethylated on the maternal allele results so the enhancers target the H19 because of CTCF binding at the ICR ; and unmethylated on the Igf2 allele,which is silent.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting early pre-neoplastic,Hyper methylation on the ICR  on the maternal allele , no CTCF binding on the materal allele which gives   expression of Igf2 from both maternal allele  and paternal allele,)in contrast to a normal cell, Igf2 is growth promoting  and there  is an over-expression (hypermethylation) of Igf2 and this is associated with  'Wilm's' tumour.</p>
<p>The Alterations at the DNA methylation of the ICR's has resulted in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, and so this causes an over-expression of the growth promoting genes. Loss of imprinting in a wide variety of tumours ;common and often seen in early event; pre-neoplastic tissue , so before you know it is a tumour, so this suggest thes hypo- or hyper events at ICR early in tumour genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine  belongs  to a class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA demethylating agents and Histone deacetylase inhibitors. The Decitabine is  tumour suppressor which acts on EZH2 which is overexpressed in many solid tumours; "it is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes". Epigenetic drugs have an effect on altering tumour cells.Overactivity of  suppressors and silences the genes they surround, including tumour suppressor genes  whose job is to stop the uncontrolled cell growth that cause cancer".  These   class of drugs target the enzymatic epigenetic regulator ,they lay down  epigentic marks, remove marks, the enzymatic function bind to ATP to move the nucleous around, find the active site of the tumour.  </p>
<p>Decitabine nuceloside analogues, irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, therfore are replicant dependant and DNA metheltransferes comes to bind it and copy the" mechanism to the daughter strand" (The Ecomonist, April 7,2012).   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr Stephen Baylin discusses the epigenetic drugs that altered tumour cells .  DNA methylation patterns undergo complex changes in cancer, total amount of Cytosine is decreased resulting in global hypo methylation; decreased cytosine methylation affects satellite DNA, repetitive sequences and CpG sites develop T-lympomas. hyper-methylation in promotor CpG islands affected genes are permanently silenced.The epigenetic DNA methylation changes in cancer appear more frequenent than mutation; silencing is brought by EZH2 a member of the 'polycomb repressive comples ' however as Baylin states in his cohort study showed it "was the first time epigentic drugs successful against solid tumor...good reaction also to chemotherpeutic drugs".Target the tumour without affecting surrounding genes.</p>
<p>The sensitive period of development are during pre-implantation period of development and the primordial germ cell development a time when  active removing and resetting epigenetic marks. The IVF is also a sensitive period ; taking out the oocyte and sperm, some adverse handling could disrupt.  There is also  a "slow growth period" that is sensitive in puberty, and using drugs to treat cancer would be inadvisable; during these sensitve period because we know of consequence for mitotically heritable changes being passed through generations, and any adverse reaction will have implication for subsequent generations, as heritable epigenetic changes may then be mitotically passed through the games.</p></div>
