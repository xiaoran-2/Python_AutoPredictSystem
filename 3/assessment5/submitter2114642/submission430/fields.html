    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 are two genes separated by an ICR showing a different imprinting pattern between the paternal and maternal alleles. Downstream of H19, there are two enhancer regions controlling the expression of both genes. Furthermore, around the Igf2 gene, additional regions show differential methylation patterns (DMR).</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR region is not methylated, allowing binding of an insulator protein (CTCF). This insulator protein prevents the expression of the Igf2 gene under the control of the enhancers. As a consequence, the expression of H19 is triggered.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR region is methylated, preventing CTCF binding and leading to transcription of Igf2 and silcencing of H19.</p>
<p>In <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">Beckwith-Wiedemann </span> syndrome, both alleles show the paternal methylation pattern, thus displaying the same expression pattern, leading to a twice higher transcription of the growth factor Igf2 and biallelic silencing of H19. In Silver-Russell syndrome, the opposite occurs: both alleles show the maternal methylation pattern. This leads to biallelic silencing of the Igf2 growth factor gene and overexpression of the H19 gene. In the Wilms tumor, methylation of the ICR and hypomethylation of the DMRs on both alleles lead to Igf2overexpression and silencing H19 lead to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug belonging to the class of hypomethylating agents. It is an analogue of cytidine and is incorporated into DNA during replication and cell division. When DNMT1 tries to methylate the incorporated decitabine, it reacts irreversibly with the enzyme, lowering the amount of the later in the cell, and consequently methylation pattern cannot be maintained and propagated to the new DNA strand during the replication process.</p>
<p>In cancer, a regional gain of DNA methylation has been observed, in particular in so-called CpG island located in promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes, thus leading to silencing of these genes. Through use of hypomethylating agents, methylation within these regions is diminished, allowing expression of these tumor suppressor genes, and leading to DNA repair, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are conserved during cell mitosis. Therefore, a given methylation state will be reproduced in the daughter cell after division. In cancer cells, hypermethylation of CpG islands will therefore be conserved through cell division and tumor growth.</p>
<p>By applying a DNMT inhibitor, these patterns of hypermethylation of CpG islands cannot be conserved after cell division, leading to a cell population with unmethylated CpG islands, even long after the use of the drug. DNMT inhibitors are active on dividing cells, and may potentially hit any cell in the process of division, even healthy ones to a certain extent, where methylated regions will be hypomethylated after the use of the drug.</p>
<p>These long term modifications of the methylation pattern of DNA should be taken into account when treating patients, in particular younger ones who have still maturating germ cells which may be affected by these drugs (so-called sensitive period), and may lead to faulty imprinting of the gametes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>70 to 80% of CpG dinucleotides are methylated in somatic mammalian cells (Hassler&amp;Egger, 2012). These methylated CpG dinucleotide play a role in heterochromatine formation, imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. Exceptions are CpG island found in a majority of promoter region. They have a high CpG density and are mostly unmethylated in normal cells.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, CpG islands in promoters are highly methylated, leading to silencing of the underlying gene (mostly tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled tumor cell division).</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repeat elements are usually highly methylated in normal cells. These regions are thus densily packed as heterochromatin. This hypermethylation is thought to contribute to repression of transcriptional noise by blocking alternative start sites resp. binding sites for transcription factors (mainly of oncogenes).</p>
<p>In cancer cells, these intergenic sites and repeat elements become hypomethylated producing genomic instability, and leading  to illegitimate recombination between repeats of non-matching chromosomes, activation and subsequent transposition of repeat elements (potentially leading to gene disruption), activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of transcription of neighboring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG regions in poor promoters can also lead to the activation of oncogenes (e.g. transcription of miR21 which targets the tumor suppressor gene PTEN).</p></div>
