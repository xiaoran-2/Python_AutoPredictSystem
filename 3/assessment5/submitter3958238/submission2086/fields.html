    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Segments of DNA that are have more CpG dinucleotides than otherwise expected are called CpG islands.  These are usually found in the promotors of genes, where the transcription factors bind.  CpG islands are usually protected from methylation, and transcription of the gene occurs.  In the case where the CpGs are methylated, the transcription factor doesn’t bind and the gene is silenced. In cancer, certain CpG islands become methylated, causing the genes they promote to become silenced, usually tumor suppressor genes, leading to increased growth of the tumor.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>CpGs also occur in other parts of the genome, such as the intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  These CpGs are normally methylated, causing these parts of the DNA strands to be inactivated.  This contributes to DNA stability, causing these parts of the genes that are not meant to be transcribed to be compacted down into heterochromatin, preventing these parts of the DNA from being accessed and preventing illegitimate insertions, deletions or reciprocal translocations from similar repeats across the genome.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>In cancer there are genome-wide changes in DNA methylation.  The CpGs in the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells are hypomethylated, or unmethylated.  This is true in every type of cancer, and is considered a hallmark of cancer.  This causes genomic instability, opening up the chromatin, and allowing the repeats to jump around the genome disrupting other genes.  It can also bring about illegitimate insertions, deletions or reciprocal translocations.  These changes can cause genes to be activated, inactivated or disrupted that are usually in place to prevent cancer.  For example, when the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in glioma cells this leads to the activation of a MicroRNA (miR21) which targets a tumor suppressor (PTEN) causing less of this tumor suppressor to be made and growing the cancer.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Imprinting is important when there is monoallelic gene expression, when only one of the two alleles is expressed.   In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region (ICR) is paternally imprinted and the ICR is methylated.  This blocks an insulator protein from binding, and allows the enhancers downstream to act in their preferred manner to activate Igf2, leaving H19 inactive.  There is no imprinting on the maternal allele, leaving the ICR unmethylated.  The insulator protein CTCF can then bind to the unmethylated ICR, which insulates Igf2 from the downstream promotors.  With Igf2 insulated, these promotors work in their secondary loop, enhancing H19 expression.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Igf2 is an oncogene, promoting growth, where H19 is a growth suppressor.  The expression of these two genes, one from each parent, work in balance.  When the disruption of imprinting occurs in this cluster, the balance is disturbed and disease develops.  In the case of Wilm’s tumors, there is a loss of imprinting, causing the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, causing an upregulation of Igf2.   With an extra dose of growth factor, and without H19 to counteract the growth, disease occurs, including juvenile tumors of the kidney.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The Economist article “Cancer’s epicentre” describes a few drugs that affect the epigenome, including Decitabine, and the uses these drugs might have on cancer.  Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  According to Wikipedia, Decitabine works by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.  So rather than demethylating DNA by cleaving the 5’ methyl group from cytosine, Decitabine prevents the methylation of daughter strands of DNA after mitosis.  In cancer as tumorigenicity develops CpG islands in the promotors of certain genes become increasingly methylated, decreasing gene expression.   These genes are usually regulatory and have a tumor suppressor effect.  In certain cancers where these types of genes have been turned off by hypermethylation of CpG islands and island shores, the use of the demethylating agent Decitabine would turn these tumor suppressor genes back on by demethylating the CpG islands in the promotors of these genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In the Economist article,  Dr. Baylin speculates that certain epigenetic drugs made tumors more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.  DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark that can be passed on to the daughter strands of DNA after mitosis.  Because of its stability of inheritance, any change made to the DNA methylation of one cell is also made to all subsequent generations deriving from that cell, having enduring effects on the epigenome.  So any effects from a drug impacting DNA methylation would continue long after treatment ends.  Epigenetic reprogramming, or the clearing and resetting of these genetic marks, occurs twice.  Once in early embryonic development, and again in primordial germ cell development.  These times of epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods, where small changes can have big consequences on the developing cell, as the future of its epigenetic state is being set.</span>  Treating patients during these times would be inadvisable.  Treatment during these times may cause epigenetic mutations or loss of imprinting which could lead to disease.  As such, a doctor should avoid treating women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, and young children and adolescents whose gametes are still developing.</p></div>
