    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation in cancer is central in the spectrum of epigenetic aberrations and is widely studied, also because is one of the epigenetic traits which is easiest to measure experimentally.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, CpG island are not methylated whereas they result hypermethylated in cancer cell: different CGI are methylated in different types of tumors so this aberration is a viable biomarker not only to understand if the disease is present but also to recognize what type of tumor is there. DNA methylation has the effect of silencing a gene if happens at its promoter, so this locus-specific methylation that we see in cancer is equivalent to a genetic mutation (for example a tumor suppressor gene); like a mutation is mitotically heritable but is reversible so we may hope to intervene on it with drugs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in a healthy cell but are hypomethylated in a cancer one. DNA methylation of repetitive elements is important for genomic stability: the presence of repetitive regions in the genome may lead to undesired translocations between different cromosomes so this repeats need to be methylated and kept in a heterocromatic region. Moreover, since they contain strong cryptic promoters in order to be able to replicate and jump around the genome, if they are not silenced via DNA methylation they may interfere with other genes expression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mytotically heritable thanks to the action of DNMT1. So if a drug can alter methylation, this modification  can pass from one cell to its daughters and be mantained in the genome even after subdivision and after the end of the treatment.</p>
<p>The capacity of a drug to alter the methylation of the genome strongly depends on the period of assumptions: in the development of the individual there are some "sensitive periods" during which its epigenome is more sensitive to external influences (diet, lifestyle, drugs): this periods correspond to development phases during which we have epigenetic reprogramming. The most important sensitive periods are the pre-implantation stage in the embrio development (during which we see erasure of epigenetic marks of the gametes and establishment of the new epigenome) and primordial germ cell development (during which we establish the correct sex-based imprint in the cell that will give origin to the new gametes). Since gametes still maturates until puberty, this period is sensitive too.</p>
<p>From a clinical perspective the presence of sensitive periods impose restrictions on the treatment since we should avoid to interfere with the germ cell maturation of younger patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One way in which aberrant DNA methylation can contribute to cancer is by disruption of imprinting. Many of the genes which are imprinted in humans (i.e. expressed only for the maternal or paternal alleles) are related to growth, so a disfunction in their expression may easily lead to cancer.</p>
<p>For example the H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted, this means that in the paternally inherited cromosome the ICR is methylated, from there DNA methylation propagates downstream to H19 which is silenced. The results is that expression enhancers can bind to Igf2 which is thus expressed. On the maternally inherited allele, instead, ICR is not methylated and CTCF proteins can bind to it. If this happens expression enhancers are blocked from reaching the Igf2 locus by the presence of the CTCF and they end up to promote H19 instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor both the ICR are methylated, so we have double expression of Igf2 and no expression of H19. This may lead to cancer since Igf2 is a growth factor and its over expression may lead to uncontrolled growth and division of the cells in which the imprint was lost.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase. It's a nucleoside analog which, when DNMT1 comes by, after replication, to methylate the second strand of a DNA molecule, it permanentely binds the DNMT1 molecule, thus inhibiting its action.</p>
<p>Since one of the epigenetic aberrations in cancer is hypermethylation of CpG islands, decitabine may be useful to contrast it. Since the action of this drug is replication dependent, it works more effectively in cancer cells, which are fastly replicating. It's currently approved for use in myelodisplastic syndrome.</p></div>
