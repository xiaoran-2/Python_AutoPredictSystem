    <h1>Submission 1621 from Anon (session_user_id: 3b5ce4fede95f1974f4be684adf7c826b44f2059)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of drugs which are categorized as <strong>DNA methylation inhibitors</strong>, i.e. DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>DNA methylation inhibitors can induce functional re-expression of inappropriately silenced genes (hyper-methylated) in cancer that cause growth arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells, because epigenetic changes are reversible. As numbers of cancers (eg: hematopoietic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs)) are caused due to hyper-methylation in DNA, such cancers may be cured by Decitabine which is a powerful demethylating agent.</p>
<p>Gene silencing by hyper-methylation is relatively common in human cancer and may have a causal relationship with tumor development and progression. Decitabine which has a deoxy ribose group, is incorporated into DNA and they target reversal of gene silencing that has been caused by hyper-methylation. This reversed function of tumor suppressor genes may thus induce normal functioning of tumor suppressor genes, thereby having anti-tumorigenic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation often silences genes that have to be functional and such epigenomic changes also bring changes in chromosomal conformations. It silences genes by tightening thread of DNA as it wraps around a molecular spool, called histone, inside nucleus. Tighter it's wrapped, harder to produce proteins from gene. Studies also showed these attachments weren’t just brief, meaningless. Methyl groups could become attached permanently to DNA, getting replicated right along with it through a hundred generations. Further when imprinted, when alters germline (sperm/egg) epigenome, a transgenerational epigenetic phenotype can develop and could cause more serious inheritances.</p>
<p>Sensitive period, epigenetically, is defined as period during development, when epigenetic changes could occur in germline of an individual and thus pass on to generations like Mendelian inheritance.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are primordial germline development (sex determination/gonadal differentiation), early childhood, gametogenesis in adult  (some extent) etc.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would bring about genetic inheritances (often not required for offsprings) and thus be more harmful on scale. Further it may also produce certain side effects in patients, additionally with good effects which may pass on to offspring. Thus it’s not advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Regulated DNA methylation in CpG island (hypomethylated in normal and hypermethylated in cancerous cells) is basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, formation of heterochromatin, gene silencing and maintain genetic equilibrium.</p>
<p>Generally, DNA methylation of promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression. <strong>Exceptions are CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters. They have high CpG density and are usually kept unmethylated, independent of their activity state.</strong> However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of underlying gene ( tumor suppressor genes).</p>
<p>Disruptions of DNA methylation at CPG islands often cause gene silencing thereby causing diseased condition, because usually these CPG islands are unmethylated in normal cells. Frequently it causes silencing of tumor suppressing genes that prevents tumor. Some notable examples are RB in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer. Such methylation also can be used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.</p>
<p>Normally <strong>I</strong>ntergenic <strong>R</strong>egions and <strong>R</strong>epetitive <strong>E</strong>lements are hypermethylated in normal cells and maintain genomic integrity. Dnmt1, methylated to maintain genomic stability. Similarly IRs silence cryptic transcription start sites. Similarly REs are methylated to silence repeats, prevent transpositions and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, prevent mutation of repeats, prevent transpositions, illegitimate recombinations and also for genome defense.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation of  IRs and REs in cancer causes genomic instability i.e. illegitimate insertions, deletions, duplications, loss of chromosomes, reciprocal translocations, illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Further hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of oncogene (R-RAS in gastric ulcer)</p>
<p>Since hypomethylation in IRs and REs starts early and progresses with time, this can be used as  biomarker too, to detect cancer and know age of cancer and determine appropriate treatment regime. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting, paternal/maternal happens to maintain gene dosage. But when disrupted, leads to imbalanced gene dosage and eventually cause diseases including cancer.  </p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster are closely related cluster of imprinted genes. <strong>I</strong>mprint <strong>C</strong>ontrol <strong>R</strong>egion of H19/Igf2 cluster are methylated on paternal allele ( paternally imprinted), thus CTCF (insulating protein) can’t bind to ICR, and DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter, thereby silencing it. This results in expression of Igf2 because enhancers access upon Igf2 to activate them.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, ICR of H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated, thus is bound by CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from enhancers downstream of H19. Thus enhancers can act upon H19 (not upon preferred Igf2) thereby enhancing H19 expression.</p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 genes are imprinted, with expression of paternal Igf2 and maternal H19 alleles. Igf2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor) an oncogene undergoes loss of imprinting in <strong>Wilms' tumors, </strong>which may be due to mutations, deletions, <strong>paternal uniparental disomy</strong>, and epigenetic disruptions (rare).</p>
<p>Disrupting imprinting causes overexpression of some gene and null expression of other. Since, for proper functioning, genes must be in balanced dosage, disrupted imprinting can cause serious diseases like Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome which is characterized by maternal allele behaving like paternal.</p></div>
