    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are sequences of DNA that contain more than the normal number of cytosine- guanine pairs.  CpG islands are commonly found in the promoter regions of mammalian genes, near the transcriptional start site.  In normal cells, CpG islands are usually unmethylated to allow gene expression.  When the CpG islands in a promoter are methylated the corresponding gene is down-regulated.  In cancer, many CpG islands are abnormally methylated.  They can be either hyper or hypo methylated. For example, in the case of hypermethylation a tumor suppression gene can be turned off by methylation of its CpG islands, leading to a deficiency in the tumor suppression protein and thus to proliferation of cancer cells.  Conversely, if a gene is abnormally under methylated, it will be expressed.  If such a gene is an oncogene, this can speed up the progression of the disease.  </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements in a normal cell are usually methylated.  This keeps these regions from being expressed from any cryptic promoters that may be present, and also helps maintain genome stability, decreasing the chances of losing chromosomes or recombination between chromosomes. Heavy methylation of repeated sequences keeps the sequences packed as hetrochromotin, which discourages recombination between repeats since the DNA is too densely packed.  In cancer cells, there is often genome wide hypomethylation which increases in severity as the cancer progresses.  This is particularly true of repeat regions. Once the repeat regions lose their methylation, they become more loosely packed and so will be more available for recombination with other repeated sequences.  Another consequence of hypomethylation of repeats is that they may become active transposons and jump into other locations in the genome.  This can cause unintended expression of neighboring genes.  So hypomethylation can cause mis-expression of genes, deletions, insertions and outright translocations of chromosomes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene is located upstream of an imprint control region (ICR).  Downstream lies the H19 gene and some gene expression enhancers.   The paternal allele is imprinted, and is methylated at the ICR.  Since it is methylated the CTCF insulator can't bind to the ICR, so the downstream enhancers can act on the Igf2 gene and turn on it's expression.  So since the paternal allele is methylated the Igf2 gene is on in this allele.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, so CTCF can bind to the ICR and act as an insulator.  This blocks the downstream enhancers from turning on the expression of Igf2, so Igf2 expression is off in the maternal allele.  In the case of Wilms tumour, the normal imprinting is disrupted. Hypermethylation of the maternal allele causes the Igf2 gene to be expressed from the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele, which causes a double dose of the protein.  Since the Igf2 protein is a tumor promoting protein, a double dose causes a type of kidney cancer known as Wilm's tumour.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a drug developed by the Japonese company Eisai, is a DNA de-methylating agent.  It is being used to treat <span>acute myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. It is a nucleoside analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells.  Once in the DNA strand, it irreversibly binds DMNTs, which reduces the amount of DMNT available to methylate DNA and causes DNA de-methylation. Since tumor cells are dividing more quickly than normal cells, this drug has a bigger effect on tumor cells.  The particular type of cancer that this drug is used to treat is associated with hyper methylation of CpG islands, so this may be why the de-methylating agent works for this cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs which alter DNA methylation can have an effect beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is heritable and so is passed down from cell to cell as they divide.  Sensitive periods are the times in human development when epigenetic marks are being laid down, including embryonic development and also development of the germ cells.  It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods since the drugs could interfere with the normal epigenetic patterning.  </p></div>
