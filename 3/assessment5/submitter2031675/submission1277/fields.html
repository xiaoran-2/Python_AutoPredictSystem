    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are located in the promoter regions of genes. The methylation of a CpG island silences the expression of the corresponding gene. Silenced promoter regions are mitotically heritable and thus passed on to daughter cells. In normal cells, most CpG islands are unmethylated. However, during cell differentiation, selective methylation of CpG islands occurs to define the genes that are expressed in a particular cell type. In cancer, locus specific hypermethylation of the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and their CpG shores is observed, which leads to the inactivation of these genes.  In rare cases CpG poor promoters of oncogenes are hypomethylated causing the enhanced expression of oncogenes.  The activation of oncogenes concurrent with the deactivation of tumor suppressors is a hallmark of cancer. Although hypermethylation of CpG islands is not considered the primary cause of cancer according to the Knudsen hypothesis, it constitutes one of several hits the cell experiences that eventually lead up to cancer. Contrary to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal cells to prevent genomic instability, such as activation of repeats and cryptic promoters, transpositions and illegitimate recombination. Globally, the degree of methylation decreases in cancer cells and the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes severe genome instability.  Which of the methylation defects is the driver of cancer is context dependent and depends on the stage and type of cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, imprint control regions can be either hyper or hypomethylated leading to silencing or activation of both parental alleles. Since imprint control regions frequently regulate the expression of growth factors, the disruption of monoallelic expression is fatal for the cell.  In a healthy cell, the H19/Igf2 cluster silences the expression of Igf2 from the maternal allele in the following way: the maternal allele is unmethylated while the paternal one is methylated. On the maternal allele CTCF binds the insulator element and allows the enhancers to act on H19, which is expressed instead of Igf2. However, on the paternal allele the enhancers stimulate the expression of Igf2. In Wilm’s tumor, both parental alleles are methylated and thus, Igf2 is expressed in a double dose. Since Igf2 promotes grow, this leads to cancer.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. It is a nucleotide analog which is incorporated into DNA upon DNA replication. Once incorporated, Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMT1 which in turn inhibits DNA methylation. Since the prerequisite for its action is DNA replication, Decitabine preferentially acts on quickly dividing cancer cells. While Decitabine is very toxic at high dose, it manages to induce global DNA demethylation when administered at a moderate dose. Currently the drug is used to fight blood cancers and the reason seems to be that blood cancers are typically driven by hypermethylation of tumor suppressor, which is counteracted by the global demethylation of the genome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are inherited mitotically, which is the reason why the effects of drugs that alter DNA methylation last beyond the period of drug treatment. Suppose a drug manages to correct the methylation pattern of an aberrant cell. If this cell divides in the future, it will pass on the corrected methylation pattern to the daughter cells. In an adult, most epigenetic marks are laid down and no dramatic alterations of the epigenome take place during the phase of somatic tissue maintenance. There are two sensitive periods in development when epigenetic marks are removed and laid down from scratch and during these times it is inadvisable to treat a patient with drugs that target the epigenetic machinery. The first sensitive phase is the preimplantation and early postimplantation phase following fertilization of an egg. The second sensitive period is the start of primordial germ cell development until complete germ cell maturation.  When young girls whose germ cells are still developing are treated with DNA methylation altering drugs, they will mostly likely become infertile or not be able to have healthy children. </p></div>
