    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG island is associated with gene silencing and plays an important role in developmental processes such as X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. The <sup>me</sup>CpG in the major groove of the DNA helix promote many DNA-binding proteins to exert its effect by attracting or repelling various DNA-binding proteins. In cancer cells, CpG island show hypermethylation alternative to the normal situation where CpG islands in promoter regions are exceptions to the "global" CpG methylation that prevails. This results in the disruption of the gene expression. The methylation of CpG island in the promoter of tumor suppressor gene result in gene inactivation. Similarly the change in DNA methylation pattern at CpG island can lead to the loss of imprinting i.e. hypermethylation at CpG island in the ICR can result in overexpression or restriction of the gene product e.g. hypermethylation of the ICR cause overexpression of the Igf2 gene in Wilm`s tumor. Lastly the CpG island shore (approximately 2kb) also was found to show hypermethylation which is related to gene expression as it was founded in different tumor cell lines.</p>
<p>In contrast intergenic regions and repetitive elements show hypermethylation which maintain genomic stability by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. It also silences cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic splice sites. It is known that DNA methylation is mutagenic (<sup>me</sup>C to T) so it also have a beneficial role for protection of the genes from transposable elements. In cancer, a genome-wide hypomethylation is evident particularly at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This result generally in genomic instability i.e. increased transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, illegitimate recombination, activation of genes (e.g. oncogenes) and/or loss of imprinting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that restricts the expression of a gene to one of the two parental chromosomes. H19/Igf2 cluster ICR work by enhancer blocking mechanism. Paternal allele ICR normally is methylated (Igf2 is paternally imprinted). ICR methylation blocks the binding of CTCF protein; this allows the enhancer to act on Igf2 and its expression, because of the chromatin looping which is preferred between the enhancer and Igf2. DNA methylation of the ICR spread to the neighboring sites resulting in the methylation of the promoter of H19 gene and therefore; it is unexpressed/silenced.</p>
<p>In maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, this allows the CTCF (insulator protein) to bind to the ICR and therefore insulate the Igf2 gene (i.e. Igf2 unexpressed/silenced) and the enhancer molecules acts on the H19 gene and promote its expression. </p>
<p>In Wilm`s tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated in both the paternal and the maternal alleles. This results in overexpression of the Igf2 gene (growth promoting gene) and tumor development which is associated with Wilm`s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) sold as Dacogen that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine act as a nucleoside analogue that binds irreversibly to the DNMT resulting in the inhibition of its further methylation process. Decitabine to exert its effect need a dividing cell i.e. replication dependent DNMTi. Therefore its effect is more pronounced in rapidly dividing cells such as tumor cells that result from hypermethylation of a specific DNA sequence(tumor suppressor gene). The combined effect of DNMTi azacitidine and HDAC-inhibitor was found to be effective by slowing the growth of lung cancer. Such results is promising for the treatment of other solid organ tumor diseases which are more difficult to be treated in comparison to the leukemia or lymphomas as it is difficult for the drug to penetrate the solid organ.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation pattern is mitoticallly heritable, therefore; drugs that target DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because epigenetic changes are principally mitotically heritable changes and will be passed to the daughter cells upon cell division.</p>
<p>There are two periods after the formation of the zygote where much of the DNA methylation and histone marks are cleared and resettled throughout the genome, therefore; environmental factors or any intervention can influence the epigenetic makeup. These periods are called the sensitive periods. The 1<sup>st</sup> is the pre-implantation and early post implantation period; the 2<sup>nd</sup> is the primordial germ cell development period to the production of mature sperm/egg.</p>
<p>During these sensitive periods, patient treatment with drugs targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators is not advisable and could have adverse effects on subsequent lay down of the epigenetic marks. Example, if the patient is treated with DNMTi during the first period this would prevent or alter the later methylation process resulting in genomic instability, and increased risk of imprinting disorder also patient treatment in the second period could affect the proper lay down of the epigenetic marks in the gamete resulting in improper development of gamete.</p></div>
