    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>The regular function of DNA methylation at CpG islands consists in inhibiting the expression of the genes whose promoter is in that region. In this way, a specialized cell can control its phenotype and exclusively allow adequate protein production. In cancer cells, methylation patterns can differ from healthy cells in two ways.</p>
<p>They can be hypomethylated or hypermethylated. In the first case, we can find nucleotide pairs that have lost their methyl group, so, the genomic region controlled by the island stops being inhibiting and can be incorrectly expressed, eventually leading to abnormal cell growing. In case of hypermethylation, the opposite occurs.</p>
<p>The promoter of a gene in that CpG island gets inhibited and does not allow the genomic expression under his control. If that occurs for tumour suppressor genes, the tissue protection level against tumoral cells lows and facilitate disease.</p>
<p>    DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to genome stability, preventing undesired hazardous deletions, translocations or insertions. When hypomethylated, the region becomes more active and transposition and recombination occurs more likely. Also, cryptic promoters can be activated and lead to long lasting silenced parts of the genome expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is an imprinted gene whose expression come only from the paternal allele. Maternal copy is silenced by imprinting process. If the inherited paternal copy is methylated, Igf2 is underexpressed.</p>
<p>The methylation state of the original maternal copy does not affect Igf2 expression, as it is silenced. H19 gene is also imprinted, but this time is the parental allele the silenced one. Methylation pattern of paternal copy does not affect to H19 expression. Maternal copy does.</p>
<p>Igf2 and H19 are in then same cluster, that is, controlled by then same ICR. If the imprinting process does not work properly, both genes are wrongly imprinted. In the case of Wilm’s tumour, Igf2 imprinting fails and H19 is overmethylated. This produces biallelic expression of Igf2 and underexpression of H19. Normal H19 acts as tumour suppressor and controls Igf12 expression. When imprinting fails in this way, Igf12 overexpresses and contributes to Wilm’s tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This drug can inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferasa enzime (DNMT). Decibitane can be useful for treating diseases in wich DNA is hypermethylated, such as myelodisplastic syndrom, precursor of myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>During celular division, DNMT is in charge of replicating methylation marks on DNA. By inhibiting its function, Decibitane prevents DNA methylation, and , of course, DNA hypermethylation causing the disease. But the effect in not restricted to abnormal cells. It affects to any replicating cell in the body. So, the side effects can be very strong and have long term consequencies, specially in young patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mitotic cellular division, not only DNA is replicated. After DNA replication, one of the DNA strands keeps original epigenetic marks. DNMT enzyme then copies methylation marks into the other DNA strand. In this way, methylation is inheritable through mitosis and has enduring effects on the epigenome, but only if the copying mechanism is properly working.</p>
<p>In development, DNA is demethylated except for the imprinted regions and IAPs. Epigenetic marks have to be established again. The periods when DNA methylation is produced are the sensitive periods, as any change in environmental conditions can lead to errors in methylation that affect to future development. Such sensitive periods are gametogenesis, blastocyst phase, and primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>If a patient is treated with any DNMT inhibitor in a sensitive phase, methylation marks will not be set and future development will be seriously compromised, with a high genome instability. </p></div>
