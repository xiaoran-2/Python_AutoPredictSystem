    <div class="field-value"><p>In healthy cells most CpG islands  remain unmethylated (despite the high concetration of CpG dinucleotides). The ones that are methylated are assosiated with gene silencing. This is due to the fact that CpG islands by definition are situated upstream of promoters of certain genes. This CpG methylation (that can be found for example in X-inactive chromosomes) is mitotically heritible thanks to the enzyme DNMT 1 which recognizes single-methylated strands of DNA after replication and then binds a methyl group to the unmethylated strand.</p>
<p>In cancer however it is often the case that certain CpG islands are hypermethylated. Most oftenly they are found at the promoters of tumour-supressor genes. This process can be found in almost every tumour but the pattern varies across different tumour types.</p>
<p>If enough of tumour-supressor genes (often coupled with hypomethylation of proto-oncogenes) are silenced by methylation, the cell begins to devide in an uncotrollable manner, which leads to tumour-genesis (as the methylation is mitotically heritibable, the daughter cells will also exhibit this locus-specific CpG island hypermethylation phenotype).</p>
<p>In contrast, healthy cells usually express high levels of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This is believed to provide genomic stability by preventing events such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes.</p>
<p>This patters is also reversed in cancer cells. Tumour cells are highly unmethylated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This is the primary mechanism that causes a hallmark trait of cancer - genomic instability.</p>
<p>Cancer cells often express high levels of different insertions, deletions and translocations. Hypomethylated repetitive elements translocate themsef all around the genome either in a 'copy-and-paste' or 'cut-and-paste' fashion. High levels of genomic instability as seen in cancer lead to all kinds of functional errors - repetitive elements can copy themselves between genes, disrupting their transcription or activate silenced ones by their strong promoters.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 gene is located on the 11th chromosome and it's expression is regulated by the H19/Igf2 cluster. In healthy cells, the Imprint Control Region in this cluster is paternally imprinted. This unables a CTCF protein to bind to it. The CTCF protein is an isulator protein that blocks the loop between the enhancers (located futher downstream) and the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this ICR is not imprinted maternally, which allows CTCF to bind to it. CTCF then isolated the connection between the enhancers and Igf2, resulting in Igf2 silencing. This way Igf2 is expressed only paternally, while H19 only maternally.</p>
<p>Wilms' tumour is a type of children liver cancer. In Wilms' tumour this ICR in the H19/Ig2 cluster is hypermethylated - the methylation occurs on both chromosomes. This way there is no CTCF binding on the maternal chromosome and Igf2 is now overexpressed. </p>
<p>Igf2, as the name suggests (Insulin Growth Factor 2), codes for a growth promoting protein. Its overexpression leads to excessive growth of the cell which therefore allows the formation of a tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent- a drug that induces hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a cytidine analog that inhinits DNA methylotransferase. It can be incorporated into the DNA strands from where it can act to prevent the binding of methyl groups to the strand and enebling given genes to be expressed.</p>
<p>It is <span>used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, where certain blood cells exhibit a dysfunctional phenotype. Myelodysplastic syndromes are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Decitabine is believed to work in two different ways. Its main function is to perform demethylation of the cancer-specific hypermethylated suppresor genes. Hovewer, being a antimetabolite, it can be also incorporated to the cellular metabolism. This interaction causes a direct cytotoxic effect which leads to deaths of tumour cells in which it is expressed.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in tumour cells is altered in a way that promotes excessive growth of those cells. Considering that epigenetic marks are mitotically heribitable (and this is done by the aforementioned mechanism that involves the DNMT 1 enzyme), this cancer-causing methylation pattern spreads in an exponential fashion. Drug-induced methylation alterations inhibit the binding of certain required proteins such as DNMT 1 therefore inhibiting the further spread of those tumour-specific methylation patterns. If these drugs facilitate further chemotherapy then firstly the spreading of the tumour is repressed by inhibiting the mitotic heritibility and then the cancer cells are killed off by standard chemotherapeutic measures.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is defined as a period when epigenetic marks are reset and then reprogrammed again. </p>
<p>In human development there are two sensitive periods - one during the preimplantation stage, which lasts until the cells differentiate from the blastocyst stage and second during mid-gestation, when primordial germ cells are developed. The cells that become germ cells are recruited from somatic cells so they must be reprogrammed first. </p>
<p>Taking drugs that inhibit the epigenetic machinery during sensitive periods may irreversibily inhibit  future methylation and therefore cell distinction, leading to phenotypic dysfunctionality and most likely death. </p></div>
