    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Methylation mostly occurs at the C-5 position of the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and plays important roles in gene activity, genomic imprinting, transposon silencing, aging, embryonic development, differentiation and carcinogenesis. In normal cells, DNA methylation occurs at CpG sites, but CpG islands remain unmethylated. In tumour cells, the level of DNA methylation at CpG sites is generally low (hypomethylation), while CpG islands may be methylated (hypermethylation). DNA hypomethylation leads to aberrant activation of genes. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is not to maintain genomic integrity such as Dnmt1 null cells display genomic instability and silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity, for example silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.  In cancer, hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats, and genomic instability was found. A recent study observed an inverse expression profile of the p15 gene and an antisense ncRNA in leukaemia. A detailed analysis showed the p15 antisense ncRNA was able to induce changes to heterochromatin and DNA methylation status of p15 by an unknown mechanism, thereby regulating p15 expression. Therefore misexpression of the associated antisense ncRNAs may subsequently silence the tumour suppressor gene contributing towards oncogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinting control region (ICR) at <em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> is commonly methylated on the paternal allele. Methylation is excluded from the maternal allele by CTCF binding. The presence of CTCF confers an insulator function upon the ICR, which blocks access of the <em>IGF2</em> promoters to the enhancers downstream of the<em>H19</em> gene. This function is lost on the methylated paternal chromosome and this enables <em>IGF2</em> expression by allowing the promoters to access the enhancers. Hypermethylation of ICR, Igf2 overexpression in Wilm’s tumour. Wilms' tumor is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19, IGF2 and KIP2. Hyper- and hypomethylation at the IGF2-H19 ICR result in reciprocal changes in IGF2- H19 expression and the two contrasting growth disorders, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome and Silver–Russell syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has recently been approved by FDA for the treatment of some types of cancer (MDS). Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent and belong to the class of DNA methylation inhibitors. Decitabine are incorporated into the DNA of rapidly growing tumour cells during DNA replication and, after replication, inhibit methyltransferases. This loss of methylation leads to activation of tumour-suppressor genes, inhibiting tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are permenantly passed to daughter and granddaughter cells on during cell division. Moreover, inhibition of DNA methylation and can trigger a lupus-like autoimmune disease. As soon as embryogenesis begins, a massive decrease in DNA methylation reprograms the epigenome and creates a nearly blank slate on which development and differentiation can be written. Thus, a decrease in DNA methylation is compatible with life, at least in embryogenesis. Nuclear transplantation-induced reprogramming can also erase (if incompletely) DNA methylation in adult cells and, when applied to cancer, seems to reverse the malignant phenotype, even in the face of genetic alterations. Outside of epigenetic reprogramming, inhibition of DNA methylation can only be achieved by genetic or pharmacologic targeting of DNA methyltransferase enzymes. Given that DNA methylation is a post-DNA synthesis event that needs to be sustained by the presence of methylating enzymes, cellular replication in the face of reduced levels of these enzymes results in significant demethylation in daughter cells, accompanied by gene reactivation.</p></div>
