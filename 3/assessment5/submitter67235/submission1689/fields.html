    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>1) DNA methylation is known to modify the DNA. It affects the C5 position of cytosines that belongs to CpG islands.  DNA methylation at CpG islands is essential for:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Normal development during cell differentiation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">X chromosome inactivation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Genomic imprinting and other aspects of epigenetic control of gene expression</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Suppression of parasitic DNA sequences</span></li>
</ul><p>2) Generally promoters with CpG islands have very little DNA methylation.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">These changes in cancer cells where promoters with CpG islands are, are hypermethylated. This causes silencing of underlying gene. </span></p>
<p>3) It has been shown in many studies that CpG sites are hotspots for inactivating mutation in tumor suppresser genes. </p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The hypermethylation of CpG island promoters of these tumor suppresser genes causes silencing of these genes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">This gives growth advantage to the cell causing it to grow uncontrollably which in turn causing cancer</span></li>
</ul><p>4) In normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. Its main roles are:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Maintain genomic stability</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Repressing transcriptional noise from alternative start sites </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Inhibiting antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Transposon silencing, aging, embryonic development, differentiation and carcinogenesis</span></li>
</ul><p>5) In cancerous cells, these elements are hypomethylated which causes genomic instability i.e.</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">No loss or gain of chromosomes or illegitimate recombination between chromosomes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Inability to silence transposition</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes</span></li>
</ul><p>6) This disruption in DNA methylation contributes to disease by:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Frequent activation of expression of full-length transcripts from retrotransposons</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Karyotypic instability facilitating the progression of a tumor</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Insertion of mobile elements whose activation can lead to transcriptional interference in neighboring genes</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><span>Imprinting is a process by which only one allele of certain genes is expressed depending on parental origin and its loss is associated with cancer.  </span></span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">At IGf2/H19 locus:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">On the maternal allele:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The Imprint Control Rregion(ICR) is unmethylated and bounds to CTCF </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">This insulates IGF2 from downstream enhancers; which enhances H19 expression</span></li>
</ul><p>On paternal allele:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The ICR is methylated and CTCF can no longer bind</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">So no insulator action; therefore looping interaction between downstream enhancers and IGF2 </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">causing its expression</span></li>
</ul><p>So Igf2 is expressed only from paternal and not maternal allele. This inactivates H19 expression on paternal allele because of spreading of DNA methylation in CpG promoter region of H19. This DNA methylation causes the silencing of H19 expression.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting in IGF2 is linked to reduced expression and abnormal methylation of H19 in Wilms' tumor:</p>
<ul><li>We see maternal chromosome results in reversal to paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter where IGF2 turned on and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth</li>
<li>The loss of H19 expression can cause loss of heterozygosity</li>
<li>The loss of imprinting of H19 on the maternal chromosome could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the hallmarks in the treatment of cancer was drug treatment. Scientists are developing drugs that can inhibit the overactivity of certain types of enzymes like:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The one that can inhibit the overactivity of the enzyme EZH2 (which inhibit the activity of tumor suppressor genes) or</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The one that inhibits the epigenetic regulator BRD4 which indirectly regulates the activity of an oncogene Myc</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Decitabine</strong> is one of the two drugs that available in the market for human use. It’s a <strong>DNA demethylating</strong> drug. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><strong>Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase causing anti-tumor effects</strong>. It works twofold:</span></p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">First, it hypomethylates DNA; thus restoring the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes and in turn restoring control over cell growth</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Second, it acts as antimetabolites (<span>very similar to normal substances within a cell</span>), which interacts with various targets in the cell causing death of rapidly diving cancer cells</span></li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression in cells.</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">An increase in DNA methylation can inhibit expression of tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell division and growth. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">When tumor suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer.</span></li>
<li><strong style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In recent time, it’s been shown that these epigenetic changes (ex. DNA methylation or acetylation) could be passed down from parent to child, one generation after the next.</strong></li>
</ul><p><span>While epigenetic changes are required for normal development and health, they can also be responsible for some disease states. </span>The DNA methylation can reprogram genes during certain periods of development. There are two waves of reprogramming that occur:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">First, during germ cell development, and</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Second, during early development</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>These two periods are known as sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming.</strong></p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">If the treatment is not selective to cancerous/irregular cells, the epigenetic changes  will be passed to next generation</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">These abnormal changes to epigenome in normal cells could make them cancerous, so the treatment could cause the very disorders they are trying to prevent</span></li>
