    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer DNA methylation at CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are disrupted. This leads to less methylation or more methylation i.e. hypomethylation or hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The normal situation at CpG islands is that specific loci, like tumor suppressor genes, are unmethylated. However in cancer, these regions tend to be hypermethylated, resulting in the silencing of these genes. Also hypermethylation occurs at the CGI shores in tumor cells. The silencing of tumor supressors will increase the chance of cells becoming cancerous and malignant. For example tumorsupressor genes like genes of the apoptotic pathway are necessary to remove "out-of-control" cells. If some of these genes are abnormally silenced, then this could lead to proliferation of malignant cells, thus contributing to cancerous cell states.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions DNA is normally in methylated state. But in cancer  these genomic regions are hypomethylated, meaning they are unmethylated (or less methylated).</p>
<p>Finally DNA methylation in cancerous cells is also disrupted at repetitive elements, that are methylated in a non-cancerous cell. Disrupted states are found in tumor cells where repetitive elements are also hypomethylated as well as in intergenic regions. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can induce genomic instability, which is a (emerging) hallmark of cancer. Hypomethylation may also activate certain genes that can silence or inhibit the transcription of tumor supressor genes like PTEN by miR21.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Within in the H19/Igf2 cluster, the Igf2 gene is a oncogene and promotes growth. In healthy cells the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and un methylated on the paternal allele. In this case only the paternal allele is expressing Igf2. The maternal as its ICR is unmethylated doesn’t express its Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour is malignant cell state in the kidney as a result of the Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome. This syndrome is caused by the maternal allele, which is acting like the paternal allele. This results in an overexpression of the oncogene Igf2 leading to abnormal growth factor expression. Also there will be no expression of Cdkn1c tumor supressor gene on the maternal allele. These two factors (the stopping of tumor supression and the activation of an oncogene) can contribute to, and engage a cancerous state within a cell as a result of a disruption of imprinted control regions. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which targets the epigenetic machinery as a therapy to treat cancer. The drug is a demethylating agent and is used to treat MDS. Its mode of action is to demethylate DNA regions by inhibiting the protein DNMTi, which function is to maintain a heterochromatic state in DNA.<br />In tumors occurs a hypermethylation at CpG islands. This could lead to the silencing of important genes like tumor supressors. If a demethylating agent such as Decitabine is used, it could demethylate hypermethylated DNA and bring these regions back to a healthy state wherein tumor supressor genes are expressed again to fight off a cancerous state. Also other critical genes could be open again for transcription.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In humans there are just a couple of waves in epigenetic reprogramming. In these sensitive periods epigenetic marks are removed and thereafter reconfigured and replaced. These periods are called sensitive because in this time the epigenetic machinery is prone to makes mistakes by certain factors (e.g. environment, radiation, etc.) Two of these waves occur in the blastocyst stage before implantation and the other in primordial germ cell development in the embryonic state. Next to these main periods of reprogramming there are other moments wherein cells can undergo a sensitive period and be epigeniticalled altered. It's not advisable to disrupt the epigenetic machinery by drugs in sensitive periods. This because the chances are high that wrong parts of the genome will be epigenentically modified in the wrong way. This could lead to all sorts of irregularities in the expression of proteins which are crucial for the patient's survival and perhaps the survival of a foetus in a pregnant mother. Beyond that, the germ cells of the foetus could also be epigenitically disrupted leading to abnormal epigenitics in later offspring.</p></div>
