    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is synonymous with gene silencing and can be mutagenic. Methylation can occur at CpG islands, repetitive elements and intergenic regions. When CpG islands become methylated, gene expression may be silenced by the formation of repressive chromatin structure and by prohibiting transcription factor binding. If methylation is disrupted at the islands, promoters (that should be silenced) can become active and in turn allow transcription of the gene, causing the up-regulation or down-regulation of specific proteins that may lead to disease or abnormal cellular regulation. In addition, chromatin which was tightly bound in its methylated state now becomes less tightly packaged down; this then allows expression of unwanted genes. In normal cells the CpG islands are not methylated, allowing for gene expression, however; in cancerous cells, these islands may become mutated and more often they are hypermethylated. These alterations silence gene expression, more specifically the expression of tumour suppressor genes, thereby allowing cancer cells to undergo division without any intervention. In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements the DNA is usually methylated. The functions of methylation at these regions are to maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription or splice sites and to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats in turn preventing transposition, transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombination. In the event that DNA methylation is disrupted in the intergenic regions or the repetitive elements, genes may become transposable which may lead to deletions, insertions, mutations and reciprocal translocations. This may lead to up regulation of mutated genes in turn leading to disease. In cancer, both the intergenic region and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. If the hypomethylation is located in the repeats or intergenic regions this may result in genomic instability and in the case of CpG poor promoters this leads to the activation of oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated prohibiting the binding of CTCF. This allows DNA methylation to spread to the H19 promoter in turn silencing it and allowing the enhancers to gain access to the Igf2 causing its subsequent activation. In the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, which allows CTCF to bind and insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The H19 promoter is also not methylated and allows the enhancers to activate the promoter. This described the cluster in a normal cell, however; in Wilm’s tumour, on both the maternal and paternal allele the ICR as well as the H19 promoter are hypermethylated thereby causing Igf2 to be over expressed and causes a loss of imprinting. Loss of imprinting is caused by a deletion or a mutation and epigenetic disruption as in the case of cancer. This abhorrent expression of genes can lead to either and increase or a decrease in growth restricting or growth promoting genes, thereby causing imprinting disorders and disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent which belongs to the class of DNMT inhibitors. DNMT is an epigenetic modifier that maintains DNA methylation and causes methylation to be meitotically heritable as it lay down the DNA methylation in the new daughter cells once bound to a nucleotide. This inhibitor is a nucleoside analogue, which incorporates into the DNA during replication causing DNMT1 to bind irreversibly to the nucleotide and subsequently prevents its release. This process is replication dependent, which means that cancer cells, which divide and replicate quickly can be more affected. Decitabine has an anti-tumour affect at low doses, which causes non specific DNA on dividing cells, thereby silencing oncogenes and other genes that become abhorrent in cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During epigenetic reprogramming, there are sensitive periods, which are periods in which the epigenetic machinery and marks are either cleared or reset, ensuring that they get passed on to the daughter cells, and thereafter maintained throughout adult life. These sensitive periods are during germ cell development and during early embryogenesis. DNA methylation is one of these epigenetic marks which cause silencing of transcription factors, promoters and/or genes thereby affecting the outcome of gene expression and ultimately the protein function. By altering this methylation status during the sensitive periods, genes may be switched on or off during division that may cause mutations and could be detrimental to the organism. Based on the sensitive periods, it is not advisable to give epigenetic drugs to younger patients, more specifically patients that are still undergoing germ cell development. By administering epigenetic drugs to these patients, it could result in these epigenetic marks being laid down without clearing or resetting them for the next generation and thereby resulting in abhorrent gene expression such as mutations.</p></div>
