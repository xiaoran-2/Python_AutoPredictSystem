    <h1>Submission 1159 from Anon (session_user_id: b42e8e8cd322a75ac5885e9284709de9048d5dfe)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved hypomethylating agent, it therefore functions to inhibit DNMT (DNA methyltransferase).  In this way, it is capable of  inhibiting the methylation of CpG islands, a common effect of CIMP (CpG island methylating phenotype.). Cancers such as gliomas, neuroblastomas, MDS (myodysplastic syndromes) and colorectal carcinomas commonly exhibit CIMP but not to the same extent in every case.  Decitabine functions as a nucleoside analogue, by binding irreversibly to DNMT and inhibiting replication of methylation patterns due to being incorporated into the DNA. Although decitabine is effective, its long-term effects could include encouraging the hypomethylation of genes in normal cells, but it has been found that its side effects as a DNMT inhibitor are minimal compared to the quality of life after administration. Decitabine is therefore an effective drug to use against cancers that exhibit the CIMP phenotype. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment as they can change the normal pattern of methylation in non-tumour cells as a side effect. This would mean that as well as inhibiting growth of a tumorigenic group of cells, the drug could also interfere with the growth of normal cell groups. DNMTi drugs in particular are non-specific in action and could possibly inhibit the growth of other cells by altering the epigenomic pattern of methylation. This is similar to the mode of action seen in HDACi drugs, which are also non-specific and can interfere with the deacetylation of other non-tumour associated histones. It would be advisable to treat patients with hypermethylated and chromatin remodelling associated tumours at stages in their lives when they are not undergoing active growth. These periods of time are considered ‘sensitive’ and would result in widespread interference with DNA methylation patterns and chromatin remodelling, leading to a change in growth patterns which could manifest for life. Sensitive periods include conception, growth in utero and early childhood. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands serves to silence gene transcription. This is useful in the normal everyday function of cells as certain genes need to be switched on or off at certain times, and this is facilitated by Dnmt1 function. However, DNA methylation of CpG islands can be disrupted in cancer resulting in a genotype where the tumour cells have methylated CpG islands and a lack of methylation at intergenic regions or repetitive elements. Normally, tumour suppressor genes are silenced when CpG island hypermethylation occurs but this is reversible. DNA methylaton in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is normally widespread across active genes and consequently silences these regions. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated and can be transcribed leading to deleterious downstream effects such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of transposons, cryptic promoters or neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters could also result in the transcription of oncogenes such as R-RAS is gastric cancer. Taken altogether, the effects of DNA methylation alteration are widespread across the genome during cancer and can progress towards a widespread state of disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of maternal and paternal alleles is usually established at sensitive periods in development such as in utero.  Imprinting control regions regulate the expression of clusters of imprinted genes. Alterations of DNA methylation at ICRs can result in a loss of ICR function which therefore results in a loss imprinted gene control. This results in an overexpression of growth promoting genes, leading to metastasis. Under normal circumstances, the H19/Igf2 cluster expresses the H19 gene from the maternal allele and the Igf2 gene from the paternal allele. In Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation of the maternal ICR results in a loss of CTCF (control factor) binding, resulting in transcription of both Igf2 genes from maternal and paternal allele via enhancer action (downstream of the genes). Therefore, disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster results in a lack of H19 transcription and double the requirement of Igf2 transcription, leading to metastasis.</p>
