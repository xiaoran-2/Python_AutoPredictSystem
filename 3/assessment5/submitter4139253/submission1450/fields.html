<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methylation is a hallmark in cancer cells and is context dependent. In normal cells CpG islands (located in promoter regions)  are hypomethylated while intergenic regions and repeats are heavily methylated. On the other hand, in cancer cells inverse is true i.e CpG islands are hyper methylated and repeats and intergenic regions are hypomethylated. Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG island is involved in control of gene expression (especially in differentiation in early development) moreover it is also involved in genomic imprinting i.e. in H19/igf2 cluster promoter of H19 is methylated on paternal allel, CpG methylation is also involved in dosage compensation of X chromosomes in mammals. On the other hand, these CpG islands are hyper methyalted in cancer cells and leads to binding of MBD proteins and leading to silencing of genes which generally controls the cellular growth and division known as tumor suppressors. Once tumor suppressor genes are silenced due to CpG methylation cells grow in uncontrolled manner and results in tumors. Identity of hypermethylated CpG islands depends upon the tumor type i.e. BRCA 1 in case of breast cancers these specific hyper methylated CpG islands in specific cancers can be used as bio markers. intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated throughout the genome. Methylation of these regions is done to avoid any illegitimate recombination between chromosomes and to maintain genomic stability as repetitive elements are found throughout the genome. In cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are globally hypomethylated leading to illegitimate crossing over, deletions and replications which results in genomic instability</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/igf2 cluster is example of genomic imprinting in which paternal allele is imprinted i.e. whose ICR (Imprint Control Region) is methylated.igf2 is a growth factor and hence an onco gene. This cluster works by the mechanism of enhancer blocking where maternal allele’s ICR is not methylated  and hence CTCF insulator protein binds to this unmethylated ICR preventing the enhancer to act on igf2, and expresses H19 Long Noncoding RNA instead. On the other hand paternal allele’s ICR and H19 promoter is methyaled and now CTCF cannot bind to it due to which enhancer acts on igf2 gene and it is expressed from paternal allele. In wilm’s tumor there is loss of imprinting due to methyaltion of both maternal and paternal alleles hence no CTCF binds on either allele to block transcription of igf2.This leads to over expression of igf2 growth factor, from both maternal and paternal allele,  and enhances cellular growth leading to development of tumor in kidney of children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. It inhibits DNA methylation and hence leads to activation of tumor suppressor or other genes. Decitabine is analogous to nucleotides and are incorporated into the genome while replication of DNA. Once incorporated in the DNA Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMT and DNMT cannot be released hence DNMT is not able to methylate DNA’s newly replicated strand in maintenance phase. This inhabitation of DNA methyaltion in maintenance phase can lead to hypo methyaltion of DNA at CpG islands and hence tumor suppressors will not longer be silenced leading to an anti-tumor effect. But this drug’s action is dependent on the replication of cells. Tumor cells replicate at a much faster rate as compared to normal cells and hence cancer cell’s methylation will be more effected than normal cells.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and is heritable in it’s daughter cells through methylation maintenance by DNMT (methyltransferase in mammals) using one parent strand as template. Hence in cancers cells DNA methylation can have enduring effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment as once the DNA methylation pattern is altered by a drug it is heritable to it’s daughter strands faithfully. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods in which epigenetic remodeling is taking place i.e. early implantation development into a epiblast and primordial germ cells development into gametes. In both cases epigenetic marks are being removed and new epigenetic marks are being setup in the cells for development i.e. in early implantation development and primordial germ cell development DNA de methylation and then re methylation are taking place along with other epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>Treating patients in these sensitive periods is inadvisable. These includes young patients of cancer whose germ cell development is under process and there epigenetic marks are being setup if treated with drug that alter epigenetic marks can lead to many epi mutations in the germ cells and hence in the upcoming progeny of those patients. Moreover pregnant womens are also inadvisable  </p></div>
