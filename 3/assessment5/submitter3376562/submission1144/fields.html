    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation is laid down by DNMT3a and DNMT3b and maintained by DNMT1. In normal cells, in general, CpG islands are <br />unmethylated. In cases where methylation occurs at CpG island it is an inactive epigenetic mark that leads to silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpG in a CpG island is associated with formation of repressive chromatin structure. In contrast to normal cells, CpG islands (CGIs) are more likely methylated in cancer cells. The CGI hyper methylation leads to silencing of tumor suppression genes. Tumor suppression hypermethylation is more frequent than genetic mutation.</p>
<p>The normal function of dna methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic integrity. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Cells without Dnmt1 display genomic instability. There is some silencing of expression at cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. The effect of silencing of repetitive elements is to prevent transposition, avoid transcription interference, and prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, there are global changes in dna methylation. The hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repeats leads to genomic instability. The instability is due to deletions, insertions, duplications, and reciprocal translocations that results in cancer or other diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/lgf2 cluster is a cluster of lncRNA H19 and lgf2 gene on chromosome 11. Imprinting is controlled by imprint control<br />region (ICR). The demethylation of ICR depend on the cluster. In case of H19/Igf2 cluster, in a normal cell, the ICR is <br />unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele. On maternal allele, lgf2 is insulated from downstream <br />enhancers by insulator protein (CTCF) and is not expressed because of enhancer blocking. On paternal allele, dna methylation<br />at ICR blocks binding of CTCF, then spreads to H19 promoter to silence it. The enhancer can access Igf2 to activate it and <br />express it from paternal allele. This is paternal imprinting. In case of Wilm's tumor (childhood kidney tumor) the imprinting at H19/lgf2 cluster is disrupted by hypermethylation of ICR. Both the paternal and the maternal alleles are methylated and lgf2 is expressed from both alleles. This leads to overexpression of lgf2 which is an oncogene that promotes growth. Such aberrant expression of imprinted genes leads to many diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in class of DMNTi-DNA Methylation Transferase Inhibitors. DNMTis are nucleoside analogues incorporated into dna upon replication. DNMTis bind to enzymatic epigenitic modifiers and inhibit their function. This is replication dependent. Since cancer cells replicate more than normal cells they are more affected thereby affecting tumor growth. Decitabine is FDA approved for myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to AML.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have lasting effects on epigenome. This is because epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable and are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Therefore, it is not advisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods of development. These are periods of early development and primordial germ cell development. During these periods there is active remodeling of epigenome. Epigenetic drug treatment during sensitive periods can alter cellular environments and adversely affect epigenetic control.</p></div>
