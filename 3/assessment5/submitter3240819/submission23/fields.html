    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are present in or near the promoter of 40% of mammals and 70% of human promoters. But CpGs occur in less than 1% of the human genome due to CG suppression. The normal function of the CpG island to help regulate gene expression, because the CpG can be methylated and cause gene silencing. However, CpGs tend to be unmethlyated and these genes are actively transcribed, for example, the promoters of most housekeeping genes contain CpGs and these need to be unmethlyated and active for basic cell function.</p>
<p>The methylation of CpGs physically blocks the binding of Transcription Factors to the target gene and so stops it being transcribed. In cancer CpG islands become abnormally hypermethylated, resulting in transcriptional silencing which is mitotically heritable. When Tumour Suppressor genes become silenced it has a positive feedback effect on the cancer, driving cancer evolution.</p>
<p>DNA methyltransferase are an important component of the cellular machinery which adds the methyl group to CpGs. The loss of DNA methyltransferase enzymes reduces methylation of CpG, methylation is important to error correction for the mismatch repair machinery; loss of this leads to chromosome instability. Chromosome instability can lead to chromosome translocations, leading to fusion genes and strong promoters driving oncogenes.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and remain hypermethylated. This region is considered junk DNA and repressed.</p>
<p>In cancer intergenic regions and repetitive elements become demethylated and hypomethylated. This allows the repetitive regions to undergo genome rearrangements.</p>
<p>In cancer, if the repetitive regions are unmethylated, the chromatin is open and recombination between repeats can occur, translocations producing fusion genes or strong promoters driving oncogenes lead to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele undergoes imprinting, so the ICR is methylated and the CTCF cannot bind, this so it cannot act as an insulator element, so the enhansers can interact with the IGF2 promoter and driving expression of the IGF2 gene on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Maternal allele does not undergo imprinting, and so the ICR is not methylated, CTCF is able to bind the ICR and act as an insulator and block the action of the enhanser, leading instead to the silencing of IGF2 and the promotion of the H19 gene expression.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor there is a loss of imprinting, so both the maternal and paternal ICR becomes methylated, no CTCF can bind, so the methylation spreads and silences H19, the enhanser is able to interact with the IGF2 promoter on both chromosomes as neither insulator element is active.</p>
<p>Because the loss of imprinting, both chromosomes ICR is methylated, no H19 is expressed, as both alleles are silences and double the amount of IGF2 is transcribed, as both enhansers can interact with the IGF2 gene. IGF2 is a growth promoter and leads to Wilms tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylating agent, specifically a hypomethylating agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases, which add methyl groups onto CpGs, causing the CpGs to become hypomethylated.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, but also shows properties in slowing tomour growth in the lung when used in conjuction with histone deacetylases. The hypomethylating action of Decitabine means that tumour suppressor promoters don’t become methylated and silenced, and so can regulate cell growth. Carrying out epigenetic changes is more effective in fighting cancer because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, so can stop the cancer from growing without killing the cell. This means fewer side effects compared with chemotherapy, because chemotherapy targets and kills all rapidly dividing cells indiscriminately and so side-effects include hair loss and damage to the bowel lining, whereas hypomethylation of CpGs and reactivation of tumour suppressors would have minimal effect on normal cells in the body.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation state of the cell is mitotically heritable after it is established. This means that any drug causing a change in the methylation state of the cell would have a lasting effect, as all the progeny of the treated cells would also retain this change.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period during development where the organism’s epigenome is undergoing clearing and reprogramming of epigenetic marks. This is important for resetting the epigenetic marks in the eggs are sperm for imprinted genes.</p>
<p>The main two sensitive periods where epigenetic marks are cleared and replaces occur after fertilisation before the zygote reaches the blastocyst stage and then during puberty when the eggs and sperm are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter the epigenetic state would not be advisable during sensitive periods because the clearing and replacing of marks needed for normal cell growth and regulation would be disrupted. Adding a drug that acts as a hypomethylating agent would mean that no methylation marks could be laid down, and so no imprinting could occur in the newly developing sperm and eggs. This would lead to infertility as genome wide loss of imprinting would not be viable.</p></div>
