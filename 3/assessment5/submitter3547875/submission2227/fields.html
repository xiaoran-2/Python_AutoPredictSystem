    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation at CpG islands is laid down by de novo methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals and is symmetrical at the CpG dinucleotides. It is maintained by DNMT1; Hemi-methylated DNA is the substrate for DNMT1. <br />CpGs are clusteredi nto CpG islands, often at promoters of genes and tend to be protected from methylation. The methylation at CpG islands is effectively the silencing of gene expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer. Recognised DNA methylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis while cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. These hits occur frequently in tumours. In tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations.<br />Biomarkers distinguish cancer from normal cells in the same sample and DNA hypermethylation biomarkers are favoured, as their detection is more sensitive. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in the loss of expression of growthrestricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. <br /><br />The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions is thought to be for maintaining genomic integrity by slencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites in Dnmt1 null sites whih show genomic instabilitiy. <br />Its normal function in repetitive elements is for maintaining genomic integrity by silencing or mutating repeats to prevent transposition and transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Also, the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination and prevents the genome from transposable elements, contributing to a genome defense model.</p>
<p>In cancer, historically the earliest epigenetic aberration found was a genome-wide lack of methylation or hypomethylation at intergenic regions/ repeats, and genomic instability. And these features were found in all cancers ever studied, more consistently than genetic mutations! So the lack of DNA methylation at the given regions can lead to cancer. And by not having these DNA methylations, not ony cancer but other diseases might occur as well as the genome remeins disrupted and instable. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div class="textLayer">
<div dir="ltr">At the H19/Igf2cluster, CTCF is an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF and without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it. The paternal methylation pattern differs from the maternal one and abnormalities in the H19/Igf2 cluster, like unpregulation of Igf2, can lead to diseases like the Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div dir="ltr">Epigenetic alterations are reversible and there is a wariness due to systemic use. Drugs designed for affeting the epigenetic process target enzymatic epigenetic regulators,vsince enzymes are most readily targeted with small molecule inhibitors.<br />Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.<br />Thus, the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is such that it prevents it from happening. <br />This can have an anti-tumour effect as the epigenetic make up of specified gene sequences is altered into a way that ensures that over- or underactivity, if not even fault of that gene sequence is rectified and uncontrolled cell proliferation is stopped or prevented.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome as whole gene sequences wil be read differently. Looking at DNA methylation as a punctuation perspective in sentences, whole sentenes will be divided or prolonged, not only altering the targeted main sentence but furthermore the following and preceeding sentenes. Analogically, DNA methylation consequently changes the whole genome. And as these punctuations will be left there, the sentences will still remain, analogically meaning that the biochemically altered state of the genome will last resulting in an altered epigenome.<br />A sensitive period is a period in which the genome is very succeptibe to epigenetic change. Sensitive period of development, for example in the fetus and in primordial germ cells.<br />It would be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods as the genome is too suceptible to epigenetic change and the change could be overproportional leading to faulty genome sequences which therefore result in disease.</p></div>
