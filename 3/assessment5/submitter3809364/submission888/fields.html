    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine<strong> </strong>is a cytidine analogue that is used as a drug to treat myelodysplastic syndromes progressed to AML.Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent like azacytidine but unlike azacytidine that can act both on DNA and RNA, Decitabine acts only on DNA by mechanistically inhibiting DNMTs. Decitabine passively dilutes DNA methylation marks globally and this is dependent on cell division, in contrast to active DNA demethylation done by TET enzymes. The global hypomethylation caused by this drug can re-express tumor suppressor genes and genes that control cell cycle. Therefore,either alone or more effectively in combination with histone -deacetylase inhibitors, Decitabine can be used to slow down the growth of tumors after chemotherapy. This drug can also re-activate methylated transposons due to its unspecificity. Hence, cancer cell targeted epigenetic drug therapies in combination with nano-technology could enhance the sensitivity and outcome of the whole treatment. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the covalent epigenetic modification to DNA in which a  methyl group is added by DNA methyl transferases to cytosine that comes before guanine (CG) . DNA methylation generally results in silencing of gene expression through chromatin condensation by more than one molecualr mechanism.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at CpG islands would repress the expression of the gene in which it is located. For example, methylation of CpG islands seen at the promoter regions of transposons would inactivate them thereby increasing the genomic integrity. </p>
<p>In cancer, the predominant feature is genome wide hypomethylation (oncogenes, intergenic regions and transposons) and tumor suppressor gene specific hyper methylation. Aberrant DNA methylation seen in cancer arises due to either genetic mutations and/or epigenetic alterations in DNMTs. This in combination with errors in other epigenetic modifiers would methylate the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes and genes that control cellular growth and division.  this leads to tumor development by transformation of cells. On the other hand, the promoter regions of oncogenes and transposons may get demethylated and expressed due to over epxression of demethylating enzymes. Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to genomic instability which in turn leads to transformation of cells and tumor develoment. For ex. hypomethylation due to deletion of DNMT1 in specific tissues and mutations in DNMT3B result in genomic instability contributing to disease. </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements facilitate genomic instability and thereby protects the genome from deleterious recombinations. In cancer, since there is genome wide hypomethylation, there is aberrant over expression of transposable  elements like LINE and SINE, which causes various mutations and rearrangements leading to cancer and other related diseases. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p><em>Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2)</em> is a paternally expressed imprinted gene regulating fetal growth, playing an integral role in the development of many tissues including the brain. The parent-of-origin specific expression of <em>Igf2</em> is largely controlled by allele-specific DNA methylation at CTCF-binding sites in the imprinting control region (ICR), located immediately upstream of the neighboring <em>H19</em> gene. In somatic cells, Igf2 and the neighbouring H19 gene are reciprocally imprinted. Igf2 gene is silenced on maternal allele and H19 is silenced on paternal allele. this allele-specific expression is associated with allele-specific DNA methylation at many differentially methylated regions in <em>Igf2</em> gene and at the <em>Igf2/H19</em> imprinting control region located immediately upstream of the <em>H19</em> promoter.The ICR contains 4 methylation sensitive CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites mediating the assembly of a chromatin insulator that blocks interactions between the <em>Igf2</em> promoter and enhancers downstream of the <em>H19</em> gene. On the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF binds to ICR silencing <em>Igf2</em>expression and stimulates the transcription of <em>H19. (PMID:<span> </span>23216893)</em></p>
<p><em></em>In Wilm's tumor, there is hypermethylation of ICR in both maternal and paternal alleles resulting in the over expression of Igf2 and over expression of growth promoting genes. this contributes to the disease. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The enduring effects of the epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation is due to the fact that the epigenetic changes brought about by the drugs are passed on during cell division,unlike other forms of gene regulation,  to daughter and grand daughter cells until they are actively erased and they do not return forever.  </p>
<p>Sensitive period refers to important periods of childhood development. Between birth and the age of 6, children move through 11 sensitive periods. From the moment of birth, children have already entered two <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span>: movement and language. Children enter four new <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span> when they're about 2 years old. These include an interest in music and a greater interest in using the senses to gain information.At the <span class="yellowFade">age</span> of 3, children enter <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span> relating to writing and reading. At 4 years old, children enter <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span> for mathematics and spatial relationships.The last two <span class="yellowFade">sensitive</span> <span class="yellowFade">periods</span> last until approximately 6 years of <span class="yellowFade">age (wisegeek.com)</span>.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is inadvisable because exposure to drugs early in life can have long-lasting implications for brain structure and function.Permanent alterations in brain pharmacology and cell signaling are induced by early drug exposure, producing hypo- or hyperresponsiveness to environmental or pharmacological challenges later in life (PMID:<span> </span>15018841).</p>
