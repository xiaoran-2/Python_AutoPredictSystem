    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation stably alters the expression of genes in cells as cells divide and differentiate from embryonic stem cells into specific tissues. Is essential during embryonic development, and in somatic cells, patterns of DNA methylation are generally transmitted to daughter cells with a high fidelity. The resulting change is normally permanent and unidirectional, preventing one organism from reverting to a stem cell or converting into another type of tissue, helping to maintain genomic stability. In humans, it affects the C5 position of cytosines that belong to CpG dinucleotides. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA methylation at repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity silencing of repeats to prevent transposition, mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition, silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoter or the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Methylated cytosine residues of vertebrate DNA are transmitted by clonal inheritance through the strong preference of DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1, for hemimethylated-DNA. Maintenance of methylation patterns is necessary for normal development of mice, and aberrant methylation patterns are associated with many human tumours. DNMT1 interacts with many proteins during cell cycle progression, including PCNA, p53, EZH2 and HP1.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">DNA-methylation-mediated repression of DNA-repair protein O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene and increased rate of K-Ras mutation at codon for amino acids 12 and 13 have been correlated with a secondary role for Ras-effector homologues (RASSFs) in tumourigenesis. Lines of evidence suggest that DNA-methylation associated repression of tumour suppressors and apoptotic genes and ceaseless proliferation of tumour cells are regulated in part by Ras-signaling. </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal-expressed <em>H19</em> and paternal-expressed <em>Igf2</em> gene share enhancers and their imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator. On the <strong>maternal allele</strong>, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents <em>Igf2</em> from accessing the shared enhancers on the <em>H19</em> side of the insulator, acting as an enhancer-blocker.</p>
<p>On the <strong>paternal chromosome</strong>, methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF from binding, allowing <em>Igf2</em> to engage the enhancers, and is required for methylation at the <em>H19 </em>promoter and silencing of <em>H19.Genetic Science Learning Center (2012/08)</em></p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, allele loss at 11p15.5 has been shown to be specific for the maternally inherited allele. In particular, the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (<em>IGF2</em>) is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed), and so maternal allele loss leads to no change in effective gene dosage, or to increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication.</p>
<p><em>H19</em> and <em>p57<sup>KIP2</sup></em>, are paternally imprinted. Mutation or deletion of the maternally inherited copy of genes results in loss of active gene function circumventing the requirement for mutation of the retained paternally inherited copy. <em>Disruption of Imprinted Genes at Chromosome Region 11p15.5 in Paediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma (1999/10)</em></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of azacitidine, sold as Vidaza by Celgene, of Summit, New Jersey, and <strong>decitabine,</strong> sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. <em>Cancer’s epicentre .

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Some sources of research, claim that cancer is not caused by genetic damage but by epigenetic changes. As we know epigenetic changes can sometimes be reversed.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is an extended period of time during development when an individual is more receptive to altered environments that have an effect on epigenetic control. They're during embryogenesis/gametogenesis, when marks are established rather than maintained.</p>
<p>In this early development we can clear and reset of epigenetic marks in PGC development and early embryonic development, treat differently paternal and maternal genomes  (DNA methylation - active demethylation of paternal genome and passive demethylation of maternal genome) and other specific regions of the genome undergo variant epigenetic reprogramming (Differential resetting in spermatogenesis vs oogenesis, repetitive elements, etc.)</p>
