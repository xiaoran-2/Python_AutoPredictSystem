    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, there are abnormalities to methylation patterns in terms of both hypermethylation, and hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In normal tissue, CpG islands (concentrations of CG dinucleotides) tend to occur at the promoter sites of genes, and in general, they are unmethylated, leading to active expression of that gene.  However, in cancer, CpG islands are often hypermethylated, and so the gene is silenced.  When the gene in question is a tumour suppressor gene, the cell will start to proliferate uncontrollably, and a tumour will ensue.</p>
<p>Methylation tends to silence genes, and in general CpGs spread around the genome (i.e. not in islands) tend to be methylated. So, in normal tissue, CpGs in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements tend to be methylated, and therefore silenced. In cancer, however, these regions become hypomethylated, and are therefore activated.  An example could be at a CpG-poor promoter region of a gene.  When the gene that is activated is an oncogene, a tumour could be the result.</p>
<p>Most often, the hypomethylation occurs at repeats.  The repeats can then replicate themselves and transpose (jump) into parts of the genome where they don't belong, leading to chromosome instability. Reciprocal translocations, deletions, insertions, or even complete chromosome duplication can result. The consequence of this could be gene disruption, or overexpression.  When the affected genes are part of the machinery that would normally keep the cell dividing in a normal fashion, cancer could occur.  Either a disrupted tumour suppressor gene, or an activated oncogene could lead to tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) whose synthesis is controlled by an imprint control region (ICR).  Igf2 is an embryonic growth factor.  The expression of H19 silences the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR of H19 is methylated (silenced).  Also, because of heterochromatin spreading, the promoter region of H19 is methylated.  Consequently, H19 is <em>not</em> expressed from the paternal allele.  Because H19 is not expressed, downstream enhancers can activate the Igf2 gene, and Igf2<em> is</em> expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR and the promoter region of H19 are unmethylated.  This allows the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR.  Consequently there is no heterochromatin spreading to the H19 promoter, and<em> H19 is expressed</em>.  This <em>prevents</em> the downstream enhancers from activating the Igf2 gene, and Igf2 is <em>not</em> expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumour, both alleles are methylated - ie. there is hypermethylation of the maternal H19 ICR and heterochromatin spreading to the H19 promoter occurs.  H19 expression is silenced and Igf2 is expressed from the maternal allele, as well as from the paternal allele.  Thus, loss of imprinting leads to overexpression of Igf2, which results in tumorogenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNMTi - inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase.  These drugs contain a cytosine analogue which is incorporated into the DNA strand during replication.  Once incorporated, Decitabine irreversibly binds DNMT, effectively removing it from the cellular environment.  One hallmark of cancer is uncontrolled growth.  Since Decitabine efficacy is dependent on incorporation into the DNA strand during replication, more of the drug will be taken up by quickly dividing cancer cells than by non-cancerous cells.  Another hallmark of cancer is hypermethylation of promoters, and the subsequent silencing of tumour suppressor genes.  By effectively removing DNMT from the cellular environment with Decitabine, tumour suppressor genes could become once again unmethylated, and regain their suppressor activity.  As more and more of the tumour suppressor genes are expressed, tumour growth is controlled.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the first generation after the drug is administered, all affected cells will be hemi-methylated, with no chance of being re-methylated since DNMT has been effectively removed from the cellular environment.  In the second generation, 50% of the cells will be hemi-methylated, and 50% of the cells will be unmethylated, etc.  By this dilution process, the daughter and subsequent granddaughter cells will be permanently demethylated. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when the epigenome is being remodelled - epigenetic marks are removed and then reset.  This occurs <em>in utero</em> during early embryonic development and during the development of primordial germ cells.  Also, children are generally sensitive since they seem to be more susceptible to environmental changes during their slow-growth periods, and because they have developing germ cells.</p>
<p>The drugs that have been developed to target the epigenome of cancer cells can also affect healthy cells.  While removal of DNMT in cancer is a good thing, in healthy cells, DNMT is required to maintain the necessary methylation of the healthy epigenome.  It would be very inadvisable to administer drugs that could permanently alter the epigenome to chldren or to pregnant women, who are in these sensitive periods.</p></div>
