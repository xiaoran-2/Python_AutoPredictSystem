    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code">Normally, The pattern of methylation of <em><strong>Igf2</strong></em> is found to differ between maternal and paternal genes, where in the maternal gene, an insulator protein CTCF interacts with the ICR preventing the action of downstream enhancers, allowing the expression of H19, thus preventing the expression of<em><strong> Igf2</strong></em>. wheras in the paternal gene, the<em><strong> Igf2</strong> </em>ICR is methylated which prevents CTCF binding, therefore allowing the action of enhancers on Igf2 gene and its expression. It was also reported that ncRNA which prevents<em><strong> Igf2</strong> </em>expression was found maternally as a result of the ICR not being methylated, the opposite was found in the paternal gene where the ncRNA is repressed as a result of ICR methulation.</p>
<p class="hg-tinymce-code"> </p>
<p>However, In case of Cancer, It was found that an alteration in methylation pattern takes place, where the ICR is methylated in <strong>BOTH</strong> the maternal and paternal alleles - as opposed to only the paternal allele- leading to overexpression of <strong><em>Igf2</em></strong> and subsequently tumor growth, which was found to be the case in Wilm's tumor which affects the kidneys in infants.  This disruption in imprinting leads to gene dose disruption, which exacerbates the disease and leads to activation of other growth factors which also aids disease progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferases inhibitor class, where it is incorporated into the DNA due to its being a nucleoside analogue and prevents action of DNA methyltransferases irreversably, thus preventing further action. It is replication dependant - as it acts by incorporation in the DNA -  seemingly ideal for dividing cancer cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Decitabine was found to be most effective in cases of myelodysplastic syndromes which show the feature of CpG island <strong>hypermethylation</strong> of tumor suppressor genes, so the drug's inhibitory action on DNMT seems to counter-act disease action, This is, however, just a speculation, as it may have another mode of action, which has yet to be discovered. Decitabine is used in small doses which seem to act quite successfully on cancer cells without causing noticable side effects (a great advantage with patients being mostly elderly), which goes a long way in increasing patient lifespan and inproving life style.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>DNA methylation patterns differ throughout the entire genome from one site to another. However, a common feature is GpG islands - found in about 60% of promotors - which are kept mostly <strong>methylation free</strong> wether they are active or not. However, that is not the case in cancer. Where a general feature is found to be <strong>hypermethylation</strong> of CpG islands.  This means that genes such as tumor suppressor genes, repair genes and apoptotic genes which are usually expressed to  slow or stop the development of cancer are silenced, thus leading to disease progression. This CpG hypermethylation extends  to CpG island shores (2 kb far) to silence further gene ICRs, and in some cases lead to loss of imprinting pattern. On the bright side, this characteristic site specific hypermethylation can be used as a sensetive biomarker to either Diagnose, determine prognosis or treatment of the disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In contrast to the hypomethylated state of CpG islands, Intergenic regions and repetitive elements which constitute about 45% of the genome and include transposable elements, LINEs and SINEs are usually found to be<strong> methylated</strong>. This is done to maintain genomic integrity by preventing transposition, transcriptional interference, illegitimate recombination and repression of transcriptional noise. Alternatly, in cancer, it was found that intergenic regions and repetitive elements are <strong>hypomethylated</strong>, leading to DNA damage, cryptic transcription start sites, altered splice sites and overall genomic instability, a sure sign of cancer progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><blockquote>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation are not specific, that is, they target all body cells, DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, meaning that it is passed on to duaghter cells unless actively erased. So the drug may have a lasting effect until active demethylation or methylation occur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time when <strong>extensive epigenetic reprogramming</strong> is taking place, it happens elaborately  in times such as primordial germ cell development and early childhood , while in females it lasts up to the time they reach puberty , as oocytes until then remain in a haploid demethylated state. So, it is reasonable to assume that treating patients at these periods of time will disturb the epigenetic state which may create epigenetic marks that may cause disease liability later on in life and poor health during childhood. In case of pre-pubertal females, treatment may influence their fertility or even the epigenetic state of their future off spring lasting through out their cell lineage.</p>
