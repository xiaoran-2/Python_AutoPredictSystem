    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification which occurs in the 5 group of cytosine almost exclusivity in CpG nucleotides. Methylation is produced by methyltransferases in different parts of genome such as CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements. CpG islands are regions highly rich in CpG dinucleotides and they are often located in promoters of genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands use to be unmethylated, due to methylated promoters are associated with inactivated genes. So, methylated promoters are associated with inactivated genes and unmethylated promoters with activated genes. On the contrary intergentic regions and repetitive elements use to be methylated in normal cells ensuring genomic integrity and avoiding genomic instability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Global methylation decrease (hypomethylation) in the genome is observed in cancer cells, by contrast CpG islands are hypermethylated. These epigenetic changes contribute to produce cancer cells because hypermethylated CpG can inactivate some genes such as suppressor genes. Hypermethylated intergenic regions can produce loss of imprinting and alter the genetic expression producing an inactivated gene when it should be activated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hypomethylation is also important in cancer development. Hypomethylated repetitive elements are not well packaged and could be interact with other repetitive elements causing transposition or illegitimate recombination. CpG poor promoters could be hypomethylated causing overexpression of their genes, for example oncogenes. Hypomethylated intergenic regions could produce loss of imprinting and activate genes which have to be inactivated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/lgf2 cluster is an example of paternal allele imprinting. This cluster consists in <em>lgf2 </em>gene, H19 gene (encode a long nonconding RNA which is not important to the imprinting of this cluster) ICR, enhancers of <em>lgf2 </em>or H19 and CTCF insulator protein.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the maternal allele, ICR and H19 are unmethylated. When ICR is unmethylated CTCF insulator protein can bind there and block the activation of lgf2 by enhancers. So the enhancers bind with H19 and encode long nonconding RNA. In this case, <em>lgf2 </em>gene is inactivated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the paternal allele, ICR and H19 are methylated. When ICR are methylated CTCF insulator protein cannot bind there and the enhancers activate lgf2 gene. H19 methylated allow binding the enhancers with the<em> lgf2</em> instead of with H19. In this case <em>lgf2</em> gene is activated.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, H19/lgf cluster has ICR and H19 methylated not only in the paternal allele but also in the maternal allele. This situation causes loss imprinting and overexpression of lgf2. Lgf2 is a growth promoting gene and when a double dose is produced have important role in cancer development causing an aberrant growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome and it looks like 5-Azacytidine. This drug is toxic in high dosage but in small dosage is very useful killing tumor cells.</p>
<p>This drug is introduced into the cell when the DNA is replicating and when  methyltransferases come to methylated the daughter strand, it is bind irreversibly and can produce cellular apoptosis. Due to cancer cells grow uncontrollably this cells will be more affected than normal cells. So this drug in small dosage could be useful to kill cancer cells without normal cells affectation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenome consist on the global epigenetic information of one organism. This information is based on methylation, histone modification and imprinting. The methylation is produced during the embryonic development in two periods; pre- implantation period (early development) and primordial germ cell development. During these periods occur an epigenetic reprogramming and all epigenetic marks are changed. These periods are considered sensitive because if the environment is altered it will be have effect on epigenetic control.<br />During these reprograming periods are inadvisable treat a patient because this could be affect seriously the epigenome. It’s not advisable that a pregnant woman is being treated at the same time because this will be affect to the baby and maybe it could be affect also their grandchildren (if the baby is in the primordial germ cell development period).</p></div>
