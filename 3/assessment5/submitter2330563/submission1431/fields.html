    <h1>Submission 1431 from Anon (session_user_id: 9fa6e83d166d56aad1b8829cd417289bf72ab74b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods in epigenetics comprise the periods where the genome is sensitive to epigenetic control. Generally speaking, there are 2 periods: The first is the pre-implantation and early post-implantation period, in which you have a genome-wide de-methylation of both the maternal and paternal genome. The second is the period of primordial germ cell development all the way to mature egg and sperm, during which you have a de-novo genome-wide and tissue specific methylation.</p>
<p>These processes are crucial for the laying down of important epigenetic marks such as gene imprinting and x-inactivation. If patients are treated with epigenetic drugs in these periods it might induce epigenetic changes to the germ cells that could be carried on to future generations, since most epigenetic modifications induce mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function.  </p>
<p>Some DNMTi (DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors) for instance function as nucleoside analogous, and are therefore incorporated into the DNA where they irreversibly bind DNMTs (DNA-methyl tranferases). This effect is non-specific and could therefore target non-cancer cells, which would be more severe in periods of active epigenetic reprogramming of the genome, where it could disrupt the normal DNA methylation patterns. <strong></strong></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, meaning that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases. This makes it a possible medical treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes precursors of acute myolegenous leukemia (cancer in the white blood cells).</p>
<p>A lot of lymphomas are caused by mutations that make histone modifier enzymes overactive. One example could be the enzyme EZH2 that targets H3K27, whose methylation is correlated with transcriptional repression. If an enzyme like EZH2 that attach methylgroups to histones become overactive, it might result in the conversion of euchromation to heterochromatin, and thereby epigenetic gene silencing.</p>
<p>An accumulation of DNA epigenetic silencing marks affecting tumor suppressor genes can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and thereby cancer. A hypomethylating agent such as Decitabine might help reverse the excessive methylation, and thereby reactivate tumor suppressor genes, thus having an anti-neoplastic effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting through hyper (or hypo) methylation of ICR (imprint control regions) can lead to genes being expressed or silenced from both parental alleles simultaneously. Imprinted genes are often involved in cell growth, and are therefore often associated with cancer.</p>
<p>The Igf2 and H19 genes are reciprocally imprinted. In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. The transcriptional repressor CTFC acts as an insulator and binds to the un-methylated H19 ICR at the maternal allele, leading to expression of H19 while at the same time protecting the maternal H19 ICR from methylation.</p>
<p>Methylation on the paternal H19 ICR prevents CTCF binding and silences paternal transcription. Instead, downstream enhancers work on the Igf2 gene resulting in paternal expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In wilms tumour, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off. This disruption of normal imprinting  causes a double dose of the growth-promoting protein Igf2 to be synthesized, leading to increased cell growth and eventually wilms tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>In normal cells, Cpg islands tend to be un-methylated whilst repetitive elements and intergenic regions tend to be methylated. Aberrant DNA methylation in cancer is associated with a ‘swap’ in these patterns, so that the CpG islands become hypermethylated and the repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated. The result of this is a loci-specific hypermethylation at CpG islands and a global level hypomethylation of the genome.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In normal cells, CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are unmethylated and protected from methylation by the transcriptional machinery, activators and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) leading to normal gene expression. In tumor cells, these islands might be invaded by transcriptional repressors , histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyl transferases (HMTs), DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) and methyl-CpG bindings proteins (MBDs) resulting in abolished gene transcription. These changes can be mitotically heritable while at the same time giving cancer cells a competitive advantage.</div>
<div>Proteins encoded by a tumor suppressor (TS) gene are involved in various stages of cell cycle control. When the TS genes are silenced, it can therefore lead to uncontrolled cell growth, up-formation of mutated cells and in the end, cancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>DNA methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions might help prevent genomic instability. Normally, genetic recombination i.e. the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis requires both genetic similarity between alleles and the presence of open chromatin, eu-chromatin. Repetitive elements have a high degree of genetic similarity but are normally hypermethylated and heterochromatinized and do therefore not disrupt recombination events. However, if these regions become hypomethylated, it can result inillegitimate genetic recombination as the repeats align. In addition, a loss of methylation in these regions can lead to transposition and activation of cryptic promoters, both contributing to transcriptional abnormalities in affected regions</p>
