    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation can be used as markers for diagnosis of human cancer. Scientists have shown that hypermethylation and hypomethylation can both be related to oncogenesis since it alters DNA expression of genes related to cell proliferation or suppressors responses. In the genome, there clusters of the guanine and cytosine nucleotide called CpG islands. In normal tissue, theses cpG islands is hypomethylated and chromatin is more open and suppressor genes can be translated normally. However, in cancer cells, one can detect hypomethylation in CpG island which will compact the chromatin and therefore inhibt suppressor gene expression that can lead to timorous cell. On the other hand, in normal tissues  intron and repetitive elements are hypermethylated while in cancer cell theses intergenic regions are hypomethylated. Also hypomethylation in moblile elements can cause disease because enhaces transcription and can disrupt neighboring genes. Because DNA methylation is reversible, unlike mutation, it can be used drug theray against methyl groups, such as demethyltransferases in CpG hypermethylation islands in cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug approved by FDA to treat/manage myelodysplasia syndrome. This drug belongs to a class of methyl transfereses inhibitors DNMTi. It acts as a hypomethilating agent. This drug is a nucleoside (citosin) analog, therefore, they are incorporeted into DNA of cell dividing (especially the ones with fast division such as cancer cell- division cell dependence). The DNA methylthransferases recognizes this analogue in the DNA and binds to it  irreversibly which results in protein degradation resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Enduring effects of drugs such decitabine (hypomethylating agent) can last for a longer period because of epigenetic change that is mitotically heritable. So one should be carefull when taking theses drugs such a pregnant lady due to sensitive periods.Sensitive period is a period in which environmental exposure may cause enduring effect in a person. There are two sensitive periods: one during early fetus development and another during gametogenesis. It means that if a woman is taking hypomethylating agents to treat cancer at the same time she is pregnant ( early fetus development) it could alter epigenetically the baby´s DNA resulting in adverse consequences. Maybe it happen that intergenic region became hypomethylated which could cause cancer in the baby.</p>
