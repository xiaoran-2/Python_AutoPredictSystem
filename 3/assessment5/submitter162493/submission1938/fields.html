    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>We can consider that the sensitive period id the period vulnerable to mutation during the methylation of DNA. Defects in DNA repair result in increased genomic instability, which can lead to malignant transformation. Additionally, defects in DNA repair render cells sensitive to DNA damaging agents. The methylation modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and cause genomic imprinting. Studies of the mechanism suggest that repression may either result from the direct effects of methylation on transcription factors, or may be indirectly caused by repressor proteins that bind to methylated DNA.</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands mainly consist in the relationship between DNMT3a and DNMT3b in mammals CpGs which is clustered into CpG islands, often at promoters of genes. We need remember that DNA methylation is laid down by de novo methyltransferases,  If we talk about the importance of the DNA methylation is crucial, mainly because In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated. However, in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased (Novak 2008). In cancer cells the disruption in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTspromote in most of the cases mitotic recombination and chromosome rearrangement, with ultimately causes the error during the mitosis which lead to the cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-value"><p>We first need to remember that  igf2 is one hormone thar  has a good groth factor and that is imprinted, with expression resulting favourably from the paternally inherited allele. However, in the human brain a loss of imprinting occurs resulting in both IGF2 and H19 being transcribed from both parental alleles.  We need to remember that  the insulator dependir on the dominand alelele determines Igf2 expression status.. CTCF can no longer bind to the insulator, and so the enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promoter.It was shown that long non-coding RNAs regulate expression of 70% of genes. Long non-coding RNAs are involved in several cellular processes like epigenetic regulation, dosagecompensation, alternative splicing and stem cells maintenance for example. Misregulations of their expression induce diseases such as developmental syndrome or cancer. disrupting imprinting at the H19/ increase, in colorectal cancer risk among subjects with comparatively elevated serum IGF-II. Mechanisms that might cause the increase in IGF-II levels  include loss of parental imprinting of the IGF-II gene.</p>

<p class="hg-tinymce-code">Decitabes belongs to histone deacetylase inhibitors.When there is an increase in DNA methylation this can result in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, allowing or promoting cancer. One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA. By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth. Decitabine is an antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell. When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p>
