    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5<sup>th</sup> position of the cytosine pyrimidine ring forming 5-methylcytosine. This modification is due to cell differentiation and it is responsible for cells with similar genomes and showing different cellular phenotypes. This may be the best way in categorizing epigenetics modification and performs important functions in cellular activities that include retro transposon silencing, genome imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation, regulation of gene expression, and maintaining of epigenetic memory.</p>
<p> 5-methylcytosine was the first epigenetic disruption to be studied in cancer cells. High methylation of the CpG islands at tumor suppressor traits terminates these genes, whilst a worldwide hypo methylation can result in genome dynamic and inappropriate activation of cancerous genes and transposable elements</p>
<p>Changing of 5-meth continuously leads to autosomal recessive disorders like immunodeficiency, and facial anomalities syndrome. It is usually essential for genomic imprinting, where the maternal allele is silenced. In addition, mutation of 5-meth in line with age and environmental factors can lead to the origin of many diseases such as cancers, arthritis, heart diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Methylation of DNA changes in repetitive elements are involved with the regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development, and carcinogenesis. However the genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of human repetitive elements is lacking. </p>
<p>Proteins following one another are changed in the intergenic region, disrupting the DNA. On the other hand, the repetitive elements may occur as a result. Repetitive elements involve the replication of a base or aa pyrimidine in the DNA, thus leading to carcinogenic cells.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to diseases due to the multiplication that leads to the deletion of some bases. This means important traits in a gene go missing. Their presence, increases the ability for cancers and rapid cell differentiation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) and H19 are reciprocally imprinted and closely linked. Igf2 transfers a fetal growth-factor and is over expressed from the maternal allele. DNA methylation is, therefore, one of the epigenetic modifications that are involved in parental imprinting. Thus, the imprinted gene performs a crucial role in placental division, growth and function, with profound effects on the development of the fetus. In humans, therefore, the H19 and IGF2 are imprinted although imprinting of IGF2 remains controversial<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>In maternal allele, usually one chromosome from the mother is responsible for the expression status. Therefore, imprinted genes are expressed from only one chromosome in an apparent of origin-dependent manner.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, both the Igf2 and H19 adopt a paternal type methylation pattern on both parental chromosomes (Yang et al., 2013). This results in early changes in the embryonic development, leading to numerous changes in further development and growth.</p>
<p>Human diseases including disorders affecting cell growth, development and their behaviors occur as a result of imprinting of DNA at H19/IgF2 cluster. This emanates from the autosomal gene that is expressed during the imprinting disruption.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This is a component of Depakote that is used to treat conditions ranging from depression to epilepsy. This compound is an inhibitor of histone deacetyleasen, which is an enzyme that is important in epigenetic regulation of the genome.</p>
<p>This is an anti-tumor drug that has an effect on the epigenetic processes. Its activity results in the blockage of the suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Decitabine is an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug. It is an antimetabolite and a demethylation agent.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Decitabine interferes with the methylation of DNA.</p>
<p>There is an increase in the DNA methylation, this results in the blockage of the activity of the suppressor genes that regulate cell differentiation and growth. Blockage of the suppressor genes, leads to unregulation of cell division, allowing and to some extent promoting.  Decitabine, thus, has anticancer effects that are twofold in nature. One way works by interfering with the methylation of DNA.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs altering DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment by the introduction of epigenetic therapy that involves changing the behavior of cancerous cells through blocking chemical changes to DNA</p>
<p>This is an important period in childhood development that refers to a special sensitivity that arouses a strong spontaneous desire to learn and master a skill or concept.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The first period of sensory awarenes begins at birth and goes on until the age of four. The second sensitive period is on language development that starts after three months. The third sensitive period is order that starts to appear from age one to age three. The fourth period is determined by the child’s attention to detail. Finally, the last phase is concerned with concentration on social relationships. It begins at around two and half years and continues until the age of five years.</p>
<p>Treating patients at the sensitive period is not advisable because most of the important human developments are in progress. Medication through treatment will mean interfering with the physiological processes of the body.</p>
