    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGIs) are found in ~60% of promoter cells and are usually kept free of methylation in their active states. Hypermethylation of CGIs is a form of epigenetic mutation and has been found to occur more frequently than genetic mutations, which results in the silencing of the underlying gene (possibly a tumour suppressor gene). Unlike genetic mutations, epimutations are reversible and have therefore become an area for scientific research in aim to find methods of reducing and preventing epigenetic errors.</p>
<p>As a consequence of CGI hypermethylation, cancerous cells can for example evade growth suppressors, sustain proliferative signalling and resist cell death, consequences of which include the hypermethylation of the biomarkers RB, MLH1, and BRCA1 in the development of retinoblastoma, colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), and breast cancer, respectively, which are examples of CIMPs (CpG island methylator phenotypes).</p>
<p>In general, most of the human genome is made up of areas called intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which tend to be found in a methylated state in normal cells. In cancerous cells, genome-wide hypomethylation can be found in these regions (whilst CGIs appear methylated). This occurs early in tumorigenesis and progresses over time with cancer development. Hypomethylation of these regions results in genomic instability, for example due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats (such as reciprocal translocations, additions and deletions), transpositions resulting in the formation of euchromatin, and the activation of cryptic promoters and disruptions to neighbouring genes.</p>
<p>There is an evident interplay in the development of cancerous cells’ hypo- and hypermethylation, though studies have shown that despite genome-wide hypomethylation and CGI hypermethylation are most common, the opposite can still result in tumorogenesis, and even still some tumours change their dependencies over time, making the stage of tumorigenesis an important factor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One common characteristic of cancer cells is a loss of imprinting. Imprinting is a process whereby genes display monoallelic parent-of-origin expression, therefore the loss of imprinting is due to either expression/silence from both alleles, resulting in growth promotion/suppression. </p>
<p>H19/Igf2 is a cluster that acts as an enhancer blocker, and is disrupted by hypermethylation. Normally, the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated on the paternal strand and unmethylated on the maternal strand, thus the cluster is only paternally expressed – it is paternally imprinted.</p>
<p>On the maternal strand, the lack of methylation allows the binding of an insulator protein called CTCF to the imprint control region (ICR) downstream of the enhancers, promoting looping of the chromosome strand between the enhancers and H19, silencing the expression of Igf2. On the paternal chromosomal strand, methylation prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR, instead creating a loop to form between the enhancers and Igf2, resulting in Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele results in an overexpression by twofold of Igf2, an imprinting disruption that results in Wilm’s tumour, an overgrowth-related kidney cancer found in children. This is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, suggesting hyper-/hypomethylation of ICRs occur very early on in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methytransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that is FDA approved and is on the market; its action is to prevent or reverse the unwanted methylation of DNA, for example treating hypermethylation that results in myelodysplastic syndrome that can progress to acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that binds to DNMTs irreversibly after incorporation into the DNA; they are classified as being division dependent thus cancer cells that divide relatively more frequently will be more severely effected by the drug. This is because, the epigenetic change towards cell normality is continually passed on to the subsequent daughter cells until the undesired methylation is actively erased.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic (cancerous-cell killing) effect and is most effective at a low-to-medium dosage. Decitabine is not selective for cancer cells, and thus it is unknown whether it works within the cell’s nucleus or cytoplasm. Moreover, the long-term effects of the drug is unknown, as well as its mechanism of action.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is responsible for imprinting control, X-chromosome inactivation and heterochromatin formation, and thus plays a crucial role in cellular identity preservation and multiple cellular pathways control. The complex interplay between epigenetics and genetics make it difficult to determine a cause-and-effect relationship, therefore both are assumed to affect each other. The active undoing of cancerous epigenetic change can revert cells closer to their normal state, eg. after being treated with Vidaza or Decitabine, allowing easier access for drugs to act on other affected cells or other areas of cancer, as the Knudson hypothesis states that cancer is the result of <em>multiple</em> DNA hits. This will therefore pave way for treatments such as chemotherapy to fully eliminate the cancerous cells.</p>
<p>The sensitive period is a developmental period when the genome is quick to respond to change due to processes such as chromosomal replication that require the unpacking of heterochromatin into their euchromatin form. Two key sensitive periods in development are during germ cell formation and at approximately the blastocyst stage; it is also strongly believed that the years following birth is a sensitive period, as cells are continually dividing for growth and repair. Treatment during these periods is inadvisable as cells are vulnerable to change, altering cellular processes, for example genome-wide hypomethylation, which can bring about tumorigenesis.</p></div>
