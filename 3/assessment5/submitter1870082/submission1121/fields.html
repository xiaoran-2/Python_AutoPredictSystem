    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands (and shores)  are unmethylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated. The CpG islands being unmethylated contributes in enhancing the tumour suppressor gene that follows whereas the methylation of the repetitive elements and of the intergenic areas contributes in the genomic stability.  In cancer there is the other way around, the CpG islands and shores are methylated and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements unmethylated. These two alterations sometimes lead to disease because the hypermethylation of a CpG island could lead to silencing a tumour suppresing gene and the unmethylation of an intergenic region or a repeptitive element could lead to genomic instability (e.g. expressing a "different" gene than the original one, it could facilitate similarily to a mutation). Finaly, in the case of CpG islands cancer generally "chooses" the opposite path of a normal cell, that is, methylating an unmethylated CpG region and unmethylating a methylated poor promoter thus expressing a gene that was not normally meant to be expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>normal cell</li>
</ul><p>In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so the CTCF cannot bind to it, the H19 is methylated, and the enhancers that follow help the Igf2 be expressed. In the maternal allele the H19 is not methylated  but it is expressed, so the enhancers work on the CTCF binding on the also unmethylated ICR, thus silencing the Igf2 gene. (Igf2 is maternally imprinted)</p>
<ul><li>Wilm's tumour</li>
</ul><p>The paternal allele is the same as in a normal cell. However, the normally imprinted maternal allele is no longer imprinted as we notice (in Wilm's tumour) that the H19 is now methylated, as is the ICR, so the CTCF cannot bind to it, thus the Igf2 gene is now expressed. The Igf2 gene is a growth controlling gene and here we have an overexpression of it, because normally is imprinted so a normal cell will have only one dosage but here we have two dosages. The out-of-control growing of a cell is in fact an indication of an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNMTi class, that is the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. A DNMT is a transport domain that, well, transports methyls to DNA. The inhibitor of DNMT, the DNMTi, blocks this transportation, so the methyls are no longer transported to this DNA region, allowing the genes located there to be expressed. If we target with DNMTi specific loci that contain, for example, tumour suppressor genes (which are methylated so a tumour is created), after some replications no methyls could be added to these loci so at some point they could be unmethylated and thus they would re-gain their function of suppressing tumours. </p>
<p>PS: I am sorry for my complicated answer but honestly I have no idea how I could make it more straightforward, thanks for your coping with me guys :)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic marks once established last for a lifetime because they are passed down from a mother cell to the daughter cells. This is true in all cases except during "sensitive periods", which are during early development (blastocysts especially) and when the primordial germ cells and the gametes are developed. In these cases all epigenetics marks seem to be erased and reset. A treatment during these periods would be inadvisable because we could not predict the side effects epigenetic alterations would have in the long run.</p></div>
