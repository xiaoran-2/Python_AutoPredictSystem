    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands in the promoter of expressed genes are usually unmethylated, whereas inactive genes often shown CpG-island hypermethylation. In tumor cells genome wide hypomethylation is commonly found, but in some CpG islands of specific genes hypermethylation is found. This is called CIMP (CPG-Island Methylator Phenotype). CIMP has been found in many different tumor types, and the genes which are hypermethylated are different in each tumor type; and in some tumors such as colorectal cancer there are different CIMP profiles associated with different genetic mutations. For colorectal cancer tumors with a BRAF mutation a different set of genes is hypermethylated then tumors which carry a KRAS mutation.</p>
<p>The alterations in DNA methylation are important in upregulating and downregulating the expression of genes which are important for tumorigenesis. Important examples of genes often hypermethylated in cancer include MLH1 (associated with MSI), CDKN2A (encodes P16, an important cell cycle regulator) and an example of hypomethylation which is favorable for tumorigenesis is miRNA21 which causes increased expression of this microRNA, leading to increased inhibition of PTEN, another cell cycle regulator.</p>
<p>Besides the effects on transcription caused by the DNA methylation differences in tumors, the genome wide hopymethylation I mentioned earlyer also plays an important role in genomic stability. In normal cells repeat elements (such as Line-elements) and transposons are methyated. This DNA methylation causes these areas to be condensed into heterochromatin; a state in which recombination of these areas is not possible (or at least very infrequent). When during tumorigenesis this DNA methylation is lost (for example due to downregulation of DNMT1, the maintainance DNA methyl transferase) these repeat stretches are less tightly packaged, "allowing" recombination to occur. This can lead to duplications, translocations, inversions, deletions and even to fusion-genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The IRC of the H19/Igf2 cluster contains a CTCF binding domain. The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated maternally. DNA methylation on the paternal allele leads to loss of CTCF binding on the paternal allele, which then results in DNA methylation spreading to he CpG-island in front of the H19 gene, which is thereby silenced. On the paternal allele this leads to activation of the Igf2 gene by distant enhancers. The maternal allele, which is not methylated, CTCF is able to bind the CTCF binding domain  and H19 is therefore not methylated, and thus expressed. At the same time, the distant enhancers are not able to pass the CTCF domain (due to chromatin confirmation effects of CTCF binding, but I'm not sure this was covered in this cource) which then direct their enhancer effect to H19, causing the H19 gene to be expressed on the maternal allele, but not Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor both alleles act as they were paternal, due to mutations, uniparental disomy or epigenetic disruption (loss of imprinting) This leads to loss of Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor) and increased Igf2 expression (tumor promoting), leading in increased cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine caused DNA demethylation by inhibiting DNMT's (incorporated in the DNA and when the DNMT comes by it's unreversibly bound). The effect of this drug only works when cells are deviding (repicating DNA). Therefor this drug is more effective against tumor then against normal cells, as tumor cells devide faster. </span></p>
<p><span>An additional remark that can be made is that when a DNA methylation mark is lost, it does not return. As DNA methylation is mitoticly heritable, this means that possible daughter cells will also have the same loss of DNA methylation as the treated mother cell. This is why epigenetic therapies do not nescecarily have to kill all cells, but if they just make them stop deviding, the risk posed by the tumor is already contained. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>sorry for repeating myself, but I think it's also relevant for the previous question...</p>
<p>"when a DNA methylation mark is lost, it does not return. As DNA methylation is mitoticly heritable, this means that possible daughter cells will also have the same loss of DNA methylation as the treated mother cell. This is why epigenetic therapies do not nescecarily have to kill all cells, but if they just make them stop deviding, the risk posed by the tumor is already contained. "</p>
<p>The sensitive period referred to here are the periods in which epigenetic reprogramming takes place, i.e. when primordial germ cells are reprogrammed, and the reprogramming which occurs right after fusion of the sperm with the egg. During these periods the effect on epigenetic marks are the highest.</p>
<p>Treatment of patients with epigenetic drugs during their teens, when germ cells are developing would therefor not be advisable, as this could lead to dramatic epigenetic defects. (This is demonstrated by the overkalix study where nutrition at this age affected epigenetics of the grandchildren)</p>
<p>ofcource during pregnancy (or just before, when the eggs are maturing?) I would also not advise epigenetic drug treatment... </p></div>
