    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands primarily locate in the promoter region of genes. Methylation of CpG islands causes a closed chromatin structure and prevent transcription mechinery from binding to promoters. Therefore, methylated CpG islands are associated with gene silencing. The CpG islands are normally unmethylated in normal tissue and allow gene expression and active transcription. In cancer cells, however, hyper-methylated CpG islands are frequently found in tumor suppressor genes and prohibit their expression. Different type of cancer possess different identity of hypermethylated CpG islands. Aberrantly hypermethylated tumor suppressor genes lose their ability to regulate cellular response such as cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell growth, therefore contributes to development of cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal tissure. Methylated intergenic regions maintain genomic integrity and can silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. Methylated repetitive elements also maintain genomic stability by preventing transposition, avoiding transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and preventing illegitimate recombination. The cancer genome is characterized by hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements which results in genomic instability and increased mutation events. The resultant aberrant transcription and chromosomal instability is demonstrated to contribute to disease onset, progression, and increased tumor incidence and poor prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) of maternal allele remains unmethylated allowing CTCF, an insulator protein which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancer, to bind and cause downstream enhancers to assess H19 promoter. On the other hand, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele which prevents CTCF from binding and along with methylated H19 lead to the enhancers assess the Igf2 promoter to activate. Therefore, H19 gene is maternally expressed whereas Igf2 is paternally expressed. Patients suffering from Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, caused by maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, predispose to embryonic/childhood tumors, such as Wilm's tumor. When the maternal allele performs like paternal allele, the Igf2 (oncogene) expression is upregulated and futher promotes cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, also called <span class="st">5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine</span> is a type of DNA-demethylating agent. It is a cytidine nucleoside analog and can irreversibly bind DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) after incoporating into newly synthesized DNA. As a consequence, inhibited DNMTs no longer maintain methylated status of DNA and thus causes DNA hypomethylation. Genes that are previously methylated and silenced are demethylated and re-expressed. Aberrantly methylated tumor suppressor genes can be re-expressed and further re-participate in regulating physiological responses such as cell cycle, cell growth, and apoptosis, and therefore contribute to the anti-tumor effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is able to be maintained through cell division. Therefore, unlike other types of gene regulation, cells treated with drugs that alter DNA methylation state can pass these epigenetic changes to thier progeny after cell division. Unless being actively manipulated, these changes sustain. Even the drugs are removed, the effect is still lasting, which contributes to the enduring effects. Nevertheless, there are limitations for epigenetic drugs. During development, epigenetic reprogramming occurs to clear and reset epigenetic marks during germ cell develoment and early embryonic development. Imprinted genes also reprogrammed in germ cell development. Thus, these two periods are vulnerable to epigenetic modifier and are called sensitive period. For patients who are pregnant or before puberty should avoid using these drugs because these drugs have great potential to cause abnormal epigenetic reprogramming and lead to epigenetic disorders and other side effects.</p></div>
