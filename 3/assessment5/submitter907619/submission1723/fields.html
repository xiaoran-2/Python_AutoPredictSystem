    <h1>Submission 1723 from Anon (session_user_id: 7be9ac560b5ca10aabd4a22568fcdecea1c19920)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, or hypomethylating agent, (sold under the trading name Dacogen) wich acts by inhibiting DNA-methyltranferases. This drug incorporate into DNA strands, preventing histones excessive methylation by uncontrolled enzymes (DNA-mt). </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Since a lot of lymphomas and myelomas are intiated by mutations that cause the hypermethylation of a lot of genes - including some tumor supressing genes, like growth factors limitter - this drug can be used to prevent the initiation or even the progression of some kinds of neoplasms.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In this context, Decitabine is used for the tratment of myelodysplatic syndromes (myeloid cells dysplasia that modifies the production of non-lymphocytic blood related cells), because it acts by inhibiting the excessive methylation of genes involved in blood cells control and proliferation.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">During the cell's replication, its epigentic marks are established in the recently duplicated DNA strands: they are passed to the daughter cells and to the granddaughter cells in the next replication. If the epigentic changes the cell suffered are not actively modified, they will be perpetuated and affect the overall state of that tissue.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In this context, there are some risks of effectively acting on the genes methylation in some sensitive periods during the life of a patient:<br /> - Epigenetical changes induced on a woman's fertile period of life is risky cause it can affect the overall state of the gametes (wich will affect the overall cell state on a soon pregnancy);<br /> - Using this kind of drugs on a pregnant women is even riskier, cause the molecules can cross the maternal-fetal barrier and disorganize the epigenetical state of the embryo's cells on a fragile moment of formation, potentialy causing malformations;<br /> - Using this kind of drugs on childs in early developmental stages are risky because the brain of children under 6 years of life is still developing, and the regulation of membrane receptors, neurotransmitters, or homones production, can be actively affected.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">CpG islands are found in 60% of promoters of genes and, in most cases, are protected from methylation: when they're unmethylated, the genes are expressed. Gene transcription are inhibited or silenced when they're hypermethylated. In cancerous cells, the CpG islands on promoters tend to become hypermethylated due to excessive expression of methylation agents or insuficient expression of "methylation agents modulators" (like regulators of the DNA-methyltranferases), leading to silencing of surrounding genes. Among this silenced genes, can be located some genes known as "tumor supressing factors": if the promoter of a gene that control celular growth is hypermethylated, silencing the gene, the lack of control will result in uncontrolled growth of that cell's lineage.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The purpose of Intergenic Region's methylation is believed to be the maintenance of DNA stability: cells whose intergenic regions are not normally methylated are more susceptible to abnormal behavior, since IGR's may contain sites that will lead to unwanted disturbances of normal transcription. The DNA methylation of repetitive elements also have the purpose of maintaining genetic stability: these elements tend to copy and paste themselves in other parts of the DNA strands, potentially leading to gene disruptions. As the mecanisms of copying and relocating are done by proteins assembled when the repetitive sequence is transcripted, if promoters in these elements are silenced, the proteins won't be assembled and the process will not occur.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">So, being the main function of that methylations the protection of genome against instability and disruption, this mechanisms are altered in almost every cancer: the intergenic regions and their repetitive elements are unmethylated (and will be activated), while some CgP islands that shouldn't be silenced are hypermethylated. Due to the genomic instability, there will be translocations of whole portions of intergenic regions, deletions, insertions, etc.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the control region in the paternal chromosome is methylated, while it's unmethylated in the maternal allele, meaning it is imprinted in the paternal allele. Since the control region is free, a protein called CTCF can bind and insulate the Igf2 site on maternal allele leading to the active H19 (a long nonconding RNA) expression by enhancers. On the paternal allele, the blocked control region inhibits the attachment of CTCF, setting the Igf2 region free; also the methylation extends from control region to the H19 region, leading to active expression of Igf2 by sequence enhancement.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The disruption of IGF2 imprinting can lead to dysfunctional diseases: the methylation of both maternal and paternal control regions will cause the overexpression of H19 and no expression of Igf2, while the loss of imprinting can lead to overexpression of Igf2 and its subsequent pathologies. An example of the first case is the Wilms tumor (kidney neoplasm) due to abnormal unmethylation on the paternal allele, leading to the lack of Igf2 production.</span></p></div>
