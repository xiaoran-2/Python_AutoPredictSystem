    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands in their normal state are generally protected from DNA methylation and are considered to be hypomethylated. They are also associated with promoter sites and when DNA methylation does occur at CpG islands, it is almost universally associated with gene silencing.</p>
<p>Methylation at CpG islands has been associated with the formation of repressive chromatin structures, which can lead to disruption of normal transcription within cells. Hypermethylation of CpG islands at the promoter sites also leads to inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA methylation induced epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is considered to be “one hit” of multiple hits proposed in the Knudson’s theory of tumorigenesis. Because this silencing is epigenetic and therefore mitotically heritable, it is thought to provide a competitive growth advantage to tumor cells that leads to cancer.</p>
<p>CpG islands found at the intergenic and repetitive regions are normally methylated. This global methylation helps maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>In cancer cells these regions tend to become hypomethylated and have less overall methylation than normal cells. Demethylation at repeats is especially disruptive and can lead to recombinations, translocations, deletions, and other transcriptional aberrations associated with overall genomic instability. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoter regions has been linked to activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>Genome wide lack of methylation was one of the earliest epigenetic aberrations associated with cancer. Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions is a feature found in all cancers studied. It is thought that hypomethylation in these regions causes greater chromosomal instability that leads to enhanced tumorigenesis. Although less common than in hypomethylation of repeats, hypomethylation induced activation of oncogenes and micro RNA’s that target tumor suppressor genes have been linked to gastric cancers and gliomas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="MsoNormal">H19/Igf2 is a cluster of paternally imprinted genes that are affected by methylation at the imprint control region (ICR).<span>  </span>Both alleles have an ICR located between the Igf2 and H19 genes with a group of enhancers located downstream of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> The ICR of the paternal allele is methylated, making it the imprinted allele.<span>    This</span> prevents binding of the insulator protein CTCF to the ICR causing the enhancers to bypass H19 and act on Igf2.<span>  </span>Absence of CTCF also allows spreading of DNA methylation to the promoter for H19.<span>   O</span>n the paternal allele H19 is silenced and Igf2 is enhanced.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> The ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated leaving it open to binding by CTCF.<span>   </span>This insulates Igf2 from the activity of the enhancers that then act on H19.<span>  </span>Maternal H19 is enhanced and Igf2 is silenced.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> Hypermethylation of the maternal ICR results in the expression of Igf2 in both parental alleles.<span>  </span>Over expression of Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with Wilm’s tumor in children.<span>  </span>Loss of imprinting is seen in an array of tumors and in pre-neoplastic tissues indicating that changes in methylation may be an early event in tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursor of myelogenous leukemia.<span>  </span>It promotes hypomethylation by acting as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.<span>  </span>Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into strands of DNA.<span>  </span>When DNMT1 tries to bind to the nucleoside and replicate it in the daughter cells, it is irreversibly bound to the DNA.<span>  </span>Because DNMT inhibition is division dependent, it has a greater impact on fast replicating cancer cells than on surrounding cells.<span>   </span>When used at low doses DNA methyltransferase inhibitors cause demethylation in some cases and have proven to have a very good anti-neoplastic effect.<span>  </span>Although no one knows for sure what the mechanism is behind this anti-tumor effect, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have been used very successfully in older patients with relatively few side effects and much greater life expectancy than with other cancer treatments.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">DNA methylation is epigenetic in nature and therefore it is both meiotically and mitotically heritable.<span>  </span>This means that changes made to epigenetic marks are passed to not only to the daughter cells but propagated through entire cell lines.<span>  </span>Because of this heritability, the effects of treatment can continue after it is stopped and in most cases, it is not known what these long-term effect of these treatments may be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> There are two periods during development known as “sensitive” periods when epigenetic marks are more susceptible to disruptions to their environment. These are periods of large scale reprogramming of DNA methylation.<span>    </span>One period is during early embryonic development, from pre-implantation up to the blastocyst stage, and the other is during the development of the primordial germ cells.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman';">DNA methylation therapy applied during these sensitive periods could be very disruptive to the epigenetic processes involved. Treatment of adults of childbearing age and children who are still undergoing primordial germ cell development should be given special consideration as the side effects could have serious long term consequences.<span>  </span>These treatments would be appropriate however in older patients where the primary concern is survival and long term consequences are not as important.<span>  </span></span></p></div>
