    <div class="field-value"><p> CGI are often found near the promotor area of the gene and normally supposed to be Hypomethylated. This Hypomethylated state of CGI maintains activation of Tumor suppressor gene exepression.</p>
<p> the first mechanism by which cancer can occur &gt;&gt;Hyper-methylation of CGI may be followed by deamination and conversion of Cytosine into Thymine which is mutagenic .</p>
<p>the second mechanism &gt;&gt;Hyper-methylation of CGI silences the Tumor suppressor gene exepression; that's why it contributes as a one hit from the hits of developing cancer . Hyper-methylation of CGI tends to increase as the tumor progresses (with time)  and also it increases with Age .</p>
<p> DNA is normally methylated in intergenic regions to prevent genomic instability (like : insertion , deletion , reciprocal translocation) and to silence cryptic promotors to avoid any transcriptional interference .</p>
<p>DNA is normally methylated in repetitive elements to prevent transpositions , silence cryptic promotors to avoid any transcriptional interference and to prevent any illegitmate chromosomal combinations.</p>
<p>Hypomethylated state of DNA in both intergenic regions and repetitive elements gives rise to genomic instability , illegitmate chromosomal combinations , transcriptional interference via cryptic promoters and transpositions followed by disruption of the coding region of the genes . </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell ,  ICR is methylated in the paternal allele that's why CTCF (the insulator element) can't bind to the ICR so Enhancers can get access to Igf2 gene then Igf2 (the growth promoting gene) exepression is activated from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In a normal cell  , ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele that's why CTCF binds to ICR and this prevents the Enhancers from acting on Igf2 so Igf2 exepression is not activated  that's why it is a normal cell</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour : Hypermethylation of ICR is observed in the maternal allele , CTCF insulator element can't bind to the methylated ICR so Enhacers can act on Igf2 rather than H19 and activate it so Igf2 exepression become activated from both paternal and maternal allele and this will disrupt the parent of origin specific exepression  which means "loss of imprinting". Igf2 is a gene involved in promoting growth so it's activation from both alleles would give rise to Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>It is important to note that both Hypermethylation and Hypomethylation at the imprint control region can cause a disease. Hypermethylation as in Wilm’s tumour and also via Hypomethylation of ICR depending on the type of ICR and the exepression of the surrounding genes (more likely to be Growth supressing genes ).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor being a nucleoside analogue . It binds irreversibly to DNMT during replication that's why it's mode of action is replication-dependent.</p>
<p>By inhibiting DNMT, we get a decreased methylation in the hypermethylated CpG islands found near the promoters of the Tumor suppressor genes and that's means an anti-neoplastic acivity in the tumor cells  . The drug is non-specific as it can act on both tumor cells and normal cells that's why it causes side effects .</p>
<p>Decitabine was firstly used in a very large doses that's why it was toxic , but by decreasing the dose , it shows superior anti-neoplastic activity aganist myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Any alterations in DNA methylation is mitotically-heritable , It can pass from a mother cell to the daughter cells during division because DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark.</p>
<p>DNA methylation epigenetic mark is cleared (like any other epigenetic mark ) between generations .This occurs in the Early development pre-implantation period in order to re-establish new lineage specific epigenetic marks after implantation . Also occurs during the PGC development in a mid gestation embryo. Also we have senstive periods which is "slow growth period" when the formation of gametes takes place. These periods are very senstive to changes in epigenetic state.</p>
<p>"Pre-implantation early development" , "Primordial germ cell development" and "slow growth period" are the sensetive periods of development .</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable . Because DNA methylation is re-established again after implantation and if any DNMT inhibitory activity is present , it will adversly affects this re-establishment process.</p>
<p>I suggest also that due to the fact that DNA repeats (IAPs) are not cleared during these senstive periods of development , the drugs acting on DNA methylation may affect these repeats and be transfered to the subsequent generations causing unexpected defects to the fetus.</p></div>
