    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In Cancer cells DNA Methylation occurs opposite as it does in normal cells. For instant CPG islands in normal cell are clear of methylation in order for the genes to be express.  In cancer CPG islands are hypermethylated which silence tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell growth. The uncontrol cell growth produces cancer.  Also in normal cells introns, repetitive elements and transposon are methylated to suppress their expressions.  In cancer those regions are not methylated hence mutating the expression of those genes which are potentially harmful.  This unmethylated regions change the epigenetic regulatory process.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an DNMT inhibitor acting as DNA-<span>demethylating agent</span>.  An other example of the same group of drug is <span>azacitidine.</span> Decitabine replicates in DNA, once incorporated it might mutate other cells in the body affecting their epigenetic control. It works better in low dosage, high quantity can be toxic.  So far Decitabine has not shown to affect normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have a large effect even after the treatment has ended because they are making changes to the epigenetic process.  Meaning, the mutations the drug cause in order to treat cancer do not only target cancer cells but normal cell as well.  It is not clear if these mutations can be harmful or not in normal cells.  Treating patients on sensitive periods is not advisable because the cells are susceptible to environmental stress.  Those mutations might be pass down throught the germline to the subsequent generaton. Sensitive periods are from conception to pre-adolescent.</p></div>
