    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island are mostly localized in the promoter regione of the gene. Methylation is a silencing factor, and by so methylation of CpG islands in the promoter leads to inactivation, repression of the connected gene. However, only little percentage of that CpG in promoter is methylated. In cancer CpG are hypermethylated. If the methylation exists in the promoters of tumor suppresor genes that leads to oncogenesis.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a methylation of intergenic region, which is relatively high in normal cells. It helps to mainain genome stability - it "immobilizes" transpozable elements, protects agains unhomologic recombination, activation of criptic promoters etc. In cancer this intergenic regions and repetitive elements are likely to be hypomethylated - less methyl groups than in healthy cells is depositioned. In causes lowering of integrity and causes an instability of the genome. It might lead to some abberviations, tumor-promoting genes activation or f.ex. activation of some miRNAs or lncRNA that target tumor supressor genes.</p>
<p>So DNA methylation can both promotes or inhibits tumorigenesis - that depends on the context and the regione of methylation,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele ICR is methylated what prevent the binding of insulator. Without the insulator there is a methylation of H19, what enables the expression of enhancers that promote expression of Igf2. In maternal allele, there is no expression of Igf2 - the ICR is unmethylated, the insulator have a free access, can bind to the DNA. It insulate the Igf2 from the enhancers. They in return enhance H19, that is unmethylated and it's expression can occure. Normally repressed Igf2 maternal allele is activated in case of Wilm's tumor. This hyphermethylation causes overexpression of Igf2 which is growth promoting. That causes the activation of tumoigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, so it belongs to DNA methylation inhibitors.</p>
<p>It causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (methylation is "diluted" by passive demethylation during replication and cell division, ac new metyl groups can not be incorporated to DNA).</p>
<p>As hypermethylation (as it was mentioned in the answer for question 1) can promote tumorigenesis (for example by hypermethylation of CpG in promoters regiones and suppression of gene suppressors or hypermethylation of imprinted loci)  it would eliminate the hypermethylation and recover the "normally methylated" state in some kind or stages of tumors (that are caused by hypermethylation).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the key mechanism of epigenetic. Drugs that affect permanently DNA methylation can cause severe disruption of epigenetic state - so activate some genes that should not be activated or silene genes that should be active. It have been shown that for the mature, fully developed cell in which majority of the genes is inactive anyway they do not cause any tragical effect (but no long-period datas are available), but for the cells that have not yet established they epigenetic identity that could be crushing. That susceptible for epigenetic damage period is called a sensitive period. Two sensitive periods have been separated this is preimplantation period and at the stage of the progenitor germ cell creation. During the sensitive period the epigenetic marks are erased and new pattern is imposed - also a DNA methylation pattern. If wrong regions were methylated (or methylated) it could for ex. caused similar disruption as in case of lose of imprinted loci in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>
