    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><em>In normal cells one would expect CpG islands’ hypomethylation. CpG islands are found in about 60% of promoters and are usually kept free from methylation independent of activity state of the corresponding genes. Methylation of CPI is associated with gene silencing. In normal cells, it happens, for example, on inactive X chromosome. Methylated CPI can be bound by specific CpG binding proteins (e.g. MeCP1 and 2) and form a repressive chromatin structure.<br /></em></p>
<p><em>In cancer, cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated. DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation and often silences tumour suppressor genes thus increasing probability of tumourgenesis.</em></p>
<p>In normal cells DNA is often methylated in the intergenic regions and repeats. In the intergenic regions DNA methylation  helps to maintain genomic integrity and silence cryptic transcription and splice sites. DNA methylation in the repetitive elements silences these repeats and prevents their transposition.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetetive elements are less likely to be methylated in cancer cells. Lack of methylation in these regions can result in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruptions to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once methylation is laid down, it can be passed on to the subsequent cell generations if methyltransferases are present in the transciption regions of the nucleus.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control. In mammals there are two key sensitive periods, which are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming: these are the pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>At the beginning of preimplantation period most epigenetic marks are removed in both paternal and maternal alleles (excluding epigenetic silencing of repeats and imprinted genes). By the blastocyst stage the epigenetic marks are reset in the cell specific manner. Mistakes in the epigenetic reprogramming on this stage could lead to unpredictable abnormalities in organism's development.</p>
<p>Second epigenetic reprogramming (including new impronting) occurs in primordial germ cell (precursors of gametes) development. If this process is disrupted by external factors (eg epigenetic drugs in the sencitive periods), this could lead to unhealthy progeny. Thus, any medicines that affect epigenetic state could be hazardous during sensitive periods. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In case of H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele, which means that this is the case of paternal imprinting.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, when ICR is unmethylated, it is bound by the protein CTCF.  This protein 'insulates' Igf2 from the action of the enhancers located downstream of these genes. Therefore these enhaces act on and activate H19.On the paternal allele, CTCF is unable to bind ICR due to methylation, thus enhancers activate Igf2, while H19 is silenced due to heterochromatin spreading from ICR downstream.</p>
<p>Upregulation of imprinting in this region may happen due to mutations that cause loss of imprinting, 'uniparental disomy' (e.g. two copies of one paternal chromosome) or epigenetic disruptions, which are however quite rare.</p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting oncogene. Loss of mprinting leads to overexpression of this growth promoting gene, excess cells' proliferation and tumourogenesis. Imprinted disorder in two clusters - H19/Igf2 and Cdkn1c - leads to 'Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome', when oncogene Igf2 is overexpressed and tumour suppressor Cdkn1c is silenced. There exists evidence that patients with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome are predisposed to embyonic/childhood tumours, eg. Wilms’ tumour of the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNMTi (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor). It binds to DNMTs, inactivates them and thereby inhibits DNA methylation in the new mititically developed cells (the process is replication dependent). In many tumours, DNA hypermethylation is observed in CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes and DNA repair genes. Thus, DNMT inhibitors might aim at reactivation of these 'good' genes and better prognosis for the patients.</p>
<p>Decitabine is very toxic, and its taxicity increases with dosage. However, at high dosage this medicine is just very toxic, with low specificity and low effect on methylation. Recently it had been discovered that decitabine is much more efficient (and much less toxic) at lower doses and has very positive effect on the patients when standard chemiotherapy doesn't work. The main concer is that the full mechanism of its action is still not clear, and it lacks specificity</p></div>
