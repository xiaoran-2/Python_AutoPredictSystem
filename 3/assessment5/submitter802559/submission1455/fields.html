    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA is usually not methylated at CpG islands which are found in promoters. These CpG islands are kept free of methylation so that promoters are accessible to transcription enzymes and factors. In cancer, these CpG islands are often hypermethylated, which causes the promoters to become inaccessible. The resulting silencing of these promoters leads to the repression of genes. When these genes include tumor suppressors, their repression will result in overgrowth or loss of control of growth and cancer.</p>
<p>For intergenic regions and repeats, there is usually a high level of methylation in normal cells. Methylation in intergenic regions makes them inactive and inaccessible to transcription factors amd enzymes, thus preventing cryptic transcription starts and maintaining genomic integrity. For the repeats, methylation keeps the regions inactive, prevents transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and illegitimate recombination. In cancer, there is hypomethylation of these regions which make them accessible to enzymes. Resulting activities cause genomic instability with transpositions and illegitimate recombination, leading to aneuploidies, deletions and duplications. Besides genomic imbalance, there might also be aberrant gene expression from cryptic promoters which are now not protected or overexpression from extra copies of growth-promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted: the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and is unavailable for CTCF binding. This causes methylation to spread to H19 silencing it. The downstream enhancers cannot access it and instead they act on Igf2 because it is not insulated by neighbouring CTCF binding, resulting in Igf2 expression on the paternal chromosome. In contrast, the ICR of the maternal chromosome is not methylated and hence available for binding by insulator protein CTCF. The enhancers cannot act on the neighbouring Igf2 to activate the expression from the maternal chromosome, and the maternal copy of Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour can be caused by the maternal copy being imprinted in the manner of the paternal copy. In other words, aberrant methylation of the maternal copy at this cluster results in an additional "paternal copy". There is double dose of paternal expression pattern: two copies of the growth-promoting Igf2 are expressed while there is no expression of the tumour suppressor Cdkn1n which is usually expressed from the maternal chromosome. The overexpression of growth proting gene and the loss of tumour suppressor which regulates growth will contribute to overgrowth seen in this disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Once the methylation is established methylation pattern is altered by epigenetic drugs, subsequent DNA replication will pass on this altered methylation pattern to all daughter and subsequent generation of cells. Therefore the effect can be long term and enduring during the rest of the lifetime of the cells/organism unless the methylation mark is actively erased as in primordial germ cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the genome is undergoing active epigenetic reprogramming, during which there will be active erasure of epigenetic marks or establishment of these marks. The sensitive periods during development are during primodial germ cell formation and after the period immediately after fertilization when the embryo is developing rapidly. When epigenetic drugs is used during the sensitive periodst, the methylation/demethylation process would be affected, resulting in abnormal germ cells or gametes, or aberrant methylation pattern in the embryo that can result in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent or DNA methylation inhibitor. It inhibits the action of DNA methylating enzymes, as a result the abnormal hypermethylation in tuomour cells will decline, restoring <span>the accessibility and transcription of tumour suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth, thus stopping the abnormal growth of cancer cells due to absence of tumour suppressors.</span></p>
<p>Decitabine can reverse the hypermethylation of tumour cells as it is a methylation inhibitor. It reduces methylation with every DNA replication, thus restoring the expression and activity of tumour suppressors. When used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, it is also toxic to tumour cells and can cause the death of rapidly proliferating cells. </span></p></div>
