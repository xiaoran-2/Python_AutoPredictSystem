    <h1>Submission 659 from Anon (session_user_id: c31a851d7a0310973fad50f2f6ed152cced40ef6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. Such drugs are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into the patient’s DNA during DNA replication. When DNMTs bind to DNA containing these nucleoside analogues, they bind irreversibly and so are so are no longer able to perform their function of methylating DNA. This is useful in treating cancers caused by hypermethylation at CpG island promoters of tumour suppressor genes, which silences these genes. With the DNMT enzymes unable to methylate DNA, the methylation of the parent cells is not maintained on both strands of the DNA in the daughter cells and is eventually lost following rounds of mitosis. As the function of these nucleoside analogue drugs to inhibit DNMTs is dependent on their incorporation into DNA during DNA replication, cancer cells are more severely affected than normal cells as they divide more quickly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A cell’s DNA methylation is mitotically inherited by its daughter cells and so can endure for up to the lifetime of the organism. Methlyation is maintained by DNA methyltransfeases such as DNMT1, which recognizes hemimethylated DNA and then acts to methylate the daughter strand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In epigenetics, a sensitive period is a period when DNA is undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. This involves the erasure and then reestablishment of epigenetic marks. There are two sensitive periods observed during development. One is during primordial germ cell development where somatic marks are removed and germ cell-specific chromatin is lain down. The other is the pre-implantation through to early development period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because during these periods the epigenome is most susceptible to environmental changes and so side effects due to aberrant DNA methylation may be seen if epigenetic drugs are used. This aberrant DNA methylation can be responsible for many problems such as the loss of genomic stability and the loss of genetic imprinting. Any changes to the DNA methylation would be mitotically inherited by every cell in the body and would then be maintained throughout life.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands acts to silence the expression of genes regulated by the promoters the CpG islands are found within. However, in cancer, CpG islands across the genome show aberrantly high levels of methylation and are said to be hypermethylated. In some cancers, this hypermethylation can also spread to regions up to 2 kb away from CpG islands. Such regions are called CpG island shores. Hypermethylation at CpG islands can silence tumour suppressor genes. The accumulation of multiple 'hits' to the DNA, such as the silencing of multiple tumour supressor genes in a single cell, could lead to cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serves to maintain genomic stability. In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation is observed. This hypomethylation is associated with increased genomic instability. When repeat regions are demethylated they are no longer locked away as part of the heterochromatin and become accessible. This means that alignment and then illegitimate recombination of the chromosomes can occur between the repeats. Repeats can also be activated and then transpose themselves across the genome. This could affect the gene expression of neighbouring genes or a repeat could transpose itself into the coding region of a gene. Genome-wide hypomethylation can also result in the activation of cryptic promoters, which can subsequently lead to the disruption of the expression of neighbouring genes. Hypermethylation or hypomethylation at certain imprint control regions (ICRs) can also contribute to cancer through the loss of gene imprinting. There could be a loss in the expression of growth-restricting genes and/or the overexpression of growth-promoting genes, such as IGF2. Aberrant methylation at ICRs can lead to tumorigenesis and cancer and can also give rise to imprinting diseases such as Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated. On this allele, the downstream enhancers act to enhance the expression of the Igf2 gene through chromatin looping. Conversely, on the maternal allele, the ICR is demethylated. An insulator protein called CTCF is able to bind to the unmethylated maternal ICR. This blocks the enhancers from being able to access the Igf2 gene and so Igf2 is not normally expressed form the maternal allele. Instead, the enhancers act to enhance the expression of the nearby H19 gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Patients with Wilm’s tumour show a loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster due to aberrant hypermethylation of the ICR. In these patients, the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated. The maternal allele thus acts like the paternal allele and Igf2 is expressed from it rather than H19. Patients with this loss of imprinting on the paternal allele therefore receive a double dose of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting and so its overexpression can lead to tumorigenesis. </p></div>
