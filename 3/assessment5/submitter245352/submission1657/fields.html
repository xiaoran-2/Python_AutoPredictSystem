    <div class="field-value"><ul><li><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNA methylation of CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements is altered in cancer. CpG islands are mostly located at promoters of genes, particularly "housekeeping" genes. The normal function of DNA methylation here is controlling the transcription of these genes.</span> <span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In cancer, CpG islands (including CpG island shores) can either be irregularly methylated or unmethylated. On a genome-wide scale, this can lead to either global hypermethylation and hypomethylation. </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">A tumour suppressor gene can be methylated, leading to silencing of this tumour suppressor gene. An oncogene can be unmethylated, leading to increased expression of the oncoprotein. These factors can contribute to cancer formation.<br /><br /></span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements contribute maintaining of genomic stability. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are - by nature - similar to other intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Normally, they are heavily methylated and heterochromatized, which prevents these chromosomal segments from aligning and causing illegimate recombinations (deletions, insertions or reciprocal translocations). In cancer, i</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">ntergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated in cancers, for example by mutations in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which promote DNA methylation. These mutations are inactivating mutations, which prevent these enzymes from methylating DNA, which results in DNA hypomethylation. </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">The novel genomic instability caused by hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, resulting in euchromatin in these regions where you want heterochromatin to fold up the repetitive elements, causes illegitimate recombinations, hich may activate oncogenes (such as BCR-ABL in leukemia) or inactivate tumour suppressor genes. This contributes to cancer formation.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Imprinting can be altered in cancer. The disruption of normal epigenetic imprinting can contribute to cancer. A good example of this is the H19/Igf2 cluster in Wilm's tumors, neonatal tumours of the kidney. On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is normally methylated on the paternal allele, which prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR. The enhancers are unable to bind to H19 and Igf2 is expressed. On the other hand, o<span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">n the maternal allele, the ICR is normally unmethylated. Therefore, CTCF is bound to the ICR. Therefore, the enhancers can bind to H19 and Igf2 is silenced. </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">In the Wilm's tumour, there is hypermethylation of ICRs. Now, not only the paternal allele is methylated, also the maternal allele is methylated. Via the mechanism described above (first dot) , Igf2 is also expressed in the maternal allele, resulting in a double dose of Igf2.  </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Igf2 is insulin growth factor 2. The term "growth factor" implies that it is associated with growth, it is an oncogene. A double dose of this oncogene can contribute to cancer growth via this mechanism. </span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Currently, there are several drugs that are indicated for the treatment of different cancers. Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Decitabine is a cytidine analog. It inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). <span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">DNMTs promote DNA methylation. Therefore, inhibiting the promotion of DNA methylation by DNMTs induces DNA hypomethylation. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">As covered in the lectures, hypermethylation is a predictor of worse prognosis in MDS (This is likely because DNA hypermethylation in MDS is a side-effect of IDH1 mutations, which inhibit TET and lysine demethylases, which result in disease progression to full-blown leukemias, mostly acute myeloid leukemia). Decitabine reverses the hypermethylation in MDS, and thereby reverses the effects that negatively affects MDS patient prognosis.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>In contrast to traditional chemotherapy and irradiation, the modern hallmarks of cancer treatment, epigenetic drugs may have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment. This is because DNA methylation is mitotically inheritable. If you alter the DNA methylation in a parental cell, this will also affect the DNA methylation in its progeny. In the case of the question asked above, if you sensitize tumor cells for cancer treatment with epigenetic drugs that alter DNA methylation, the progeny of these tumor cells will also be sensitized for cancer treatment. This also brings forth several risks. It is inadvisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods, when<span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;"> there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. </span><span style="line-height:21px;font-size:14px;">Sensitive periods of development are mainly during early development, in the first trimester of the fetus and during pre-conception. This includes epigenetic reprogramming of the oocytes and spermatocytes. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During sensitive periods, patients (and their unborn/unconceived children), are particularly sensitive to epigenetic reprogramming by epigenetic drugs. Changes in the epigenome induced by epigenetic drugs in sensitive periods may affect the development of the fetus or even cause diseases in mature life (or even of the (grand)children).</span></li>
