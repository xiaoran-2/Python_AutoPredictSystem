    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA at islands methylation usually leads to silencing involved in imprinting, X inactivation tissue-specificity etc, Normally CpG islands are <em>hypo</em>methylated, whereas in cancer they tend to be <em>hyper</em>methylated, which causes the silencing of genes that normally are not silenced, such as tumor suppressor genes, which makes its contribution to disease development, and, combined with other factors, may lead to cancer, since this silencing is transferred to the daugher cells due to mitotic heritability. However, this hypermethylation of tumor suppressors alone in insufficient to produce cancer, there have to be several collaborating factors  (Knudson's law).</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are normally <em>hyper</em>methylated (even though some of them are still transcribed, for instance, to produce lncRNAs), but in cancer they are <em>hypo</em>methylated. That is, it leads to expression of genes that are not normally expressed that may interfere with normal fuctions of cells and disrupt salutary processes. For example, undesirable non-coding RNAs may be transribed from introns and intergenic regions, <span>ultraconserved regions, and this aberrant expression may contribute to neuroblastoma or carcinoma. Otherwise useful non-coding RNAs may be overexpressed and, as in the case of HOTAIR, cause alteration in H3K27 methylation patterns and increase in cancer invasiveness, or, as with ANRIL, silence tumor suppressor genes. I</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to that, an excessive transcription of repeats may lead to impaired heterochromatin tructure and thus genomic instability, which, in turn, amplifies the likelihood of mutations, therefore contributing to cancer as well.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In paternal allele lgf2 is expressed because ICR is methylated, which means that there is no binding by CTCF and no insulation from enhancers, which act on lgf2. H19 is methylated and thus silenced due to methylation spreading from ICR.</p>
<p>In contrast, in maternal allele H19 is unmethylated and therefore expressed, as well as the ICR, hence CTCF binds to lgf2 insulating it from enhancers and, consequently, inhibiting its expression.</p>
<p>In tumour cells, imprinting may be disrupted: in Wilm's tumour hypermethylation of ICRs is observed, which causes lgf2 to be overexpressed, that is, expressed on both alleles, because, as it is in the paternal allele of normal cell, there is no CTCF binding and therefore no insulation. No H19 in produces due to methylation spreading. This results in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and exorbitant expression of growth promoting genes, thus facilitating growth and proliferation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, <span>DNMT inhibitor. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase and is division-dependant, since DNMT binding to DNA is irreversible and to have unmenthylated DNA cell needs to replicate it (DNA will remain on old strands but will not be transferred to new ones). Tumour cells replicate much more rapidly than normal cells do, and, as a consequence, provided that DNMT is inhibited, new daughter cells will have unmethylated DNA. Therefore it will probably clear aberrant methylation of imprinted regions (h19/lgf2) and CpGs, therefore eliminating the effects of these abnormal methylation patterns.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation involved inimprinting, tissue differentiation and X chromosome inactivation, therefore, disruption of this mechanism will impede normal function of these processes. Also, disruption of normal DNA methylation may lead to genomic instability, activation of transposones that are usually silenced by methylation marks.</p>
<p>There are certain sensitive periods of development when an organism is the most vulnerable to environmental inluences, it is a period of epigenetic reprogramming: <span>the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks. These are the development of primordial germ cells and embryo preimplantation stage. If DNA methylation is disrupted during these periods, this is likely to result in problems with tissue differentiation, which might produce an unviable embryo due to it or an embyo with imprinting diseases and X incativation diseases. Also it may predispose embryos to cancer due to genomic instability and absence or insufficient silencing of growth-promoting factors.</span></p></div>
