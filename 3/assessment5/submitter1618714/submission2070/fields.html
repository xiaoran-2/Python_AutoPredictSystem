    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p>The CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated and genes are expressed in a normal cell, but CpG island become hypermethylated leading the inactivation of tumour suppressors in cancer cell. When there is an inactivation of tumour suppressors then is disrupted the cell cycle. Under normal conditions of cell cycle, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated but when are unmethylated (cancer cell) the repetitive elements and intergenic regions can promote cellular instability (recombination, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters), mutation (indels) and gen silencing.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<p>A modification of imprinting causes changes in gene expression as in cluster H19/Igf2. Imprint control region in cluster H19/Igf2 remains methylated on the paternal chromosome to allow H19 gene imprinting and Igf2 be expressed. In normal gene expression, the maternal allele Igf2 remains silenced because the ICR is unmethylated and gets CTCF protein, leading to enhancers access to H19, which causes the activation of the gene; but if the ICR is methylated then works just like the paternal chromosome where the gene Igf2 is expressed but not H19. When both chromosomes express Igf2 gene but no H19, then we get biallelic expression and Wilm's tumour arises.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Lymphomas are cause by mutation on EZH2, an enzyme that are overeactive causing DNA hypermethylation, which is associated with transcriptional gene silencing (leading uncontrolled cell growth).  Low dosages of Decitabine induce a global hypomethylation and transcriptional downregulation and upregulation of several genes. Treatment with Decitabine induces “normal’ gene expression by decreasing of methylation in a variety of human cancer cells, as well as reactivating genes that can modify tumor cells growing.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Drugs that inhibit methyltransferases has potential anti proliferative and apoptotic effects y cancer cells. DNA methylation induces gene suppression and promote cancer cell growing. With drugs like Decitabine the normal function of genes is reestablished. Besides those drugs have antimetabolic activity leading to cells incorporate this substances and interact with them to stimulate apoptosis of cancer cells. This treatment has the capability to make reversible the effects of hypermethylation on cancer cells due the memory that provides in the machinery of cells. Due to this contribution is possible to be erased the programming of the cell, and that could be “reprogramming “, which is especially important in sensitive periods like programming demethylation at early development (gametes) when cells are demethylated and reprogrammed; that’s why patients can’t take this kind of drug when they are pregnant or try to get pregnant.</p></div>
