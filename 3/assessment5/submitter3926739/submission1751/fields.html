    <h1>Submission 1751 from Anon (session_user_id: 51ffce44ad19d271e172f569f94c4da7b672da9c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of DNA methyltranspherase-inhibitiors, therefore, it inhibits hypermethylation of CpG-islands, that is charasteristic for cancer. The molecule is a nucleoside analogue, which incorporates DNA during replication and then, during DNA methylation, binds a DNMT irreversibly so that it cannot be released. In such a division-dependent way it diminishes the concentration of active DNMT in the cell and thus preserves promoters of particular genes, tumour suppressor genes among them, from being methylated and thus silenced. In such a way, by maintaining active state of tumour suppressing genes (anti-oncogenes), decitabine can produce anti-tumour effect on malignant cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We know that DNA-methylation patterns are being maintained in the genome of somatic cells through cell divisions that means they are mitotically heritable. This suggests that effect of a drug altering the DNA methylation pattern of a cell may be prolonged by the proper epigenetic system of that cell through a number of division cycles. It is important that some generations of daughter cells will possess the same epigenetic patterns that a cell affected by a drug and therefore will be more susceptible for their proper genetic tumour suppressing mechanisms (for example, the apoptosis induction) as for other cures such as chemotherapeutics.</p>
<p>But one should be very careful using regulators of epigenetic enzymes because their are likely to induce side effects on normal tissues of the organism, and especially on the dividing cells. It may be particularly crucial during the sensitive periods, when the epigenetic marks are being rearranged.</p>
<p>There are two main periods sensitive for the epigenetic status establishment: the period of epigenetic reprogramming right after the fertilisation and the period of the germ cell line formation. The second period endures right to the adulthood, especially in females. And an epigenetic-based treatment in this period may affect the establishment of parental imprinting in the germ cells, which then may lead to undesirable consequences in the potential offspring.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG-islands are often being found in the promoter regions of the genes. Their methylated state correlates with transcription silencing. Normally, CpG-islands in promoters are kept free of methylation. But in cancer cells promoter-located CpG-islands may become highly methylated, which leads to silencing of underlying genes (Hassler and Egger, 2012). If there are tumour suppressor genes that become silenced, the cell becomes unable to take control over its division cycle and may thus be transformed into a cancer cell. Silencing of particular sets of tumour suppressor genes is often tissue- and/or tumour type-specific. For some types of cancer there is described a so called CpG island methylator phenotype, which means that some sets of genes are frequently methylated.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements there are single CpGs (not assembled in "islands'), which are normally methylated to preserve non-homologous chromosomes from recombination and transposable elements from being moved and thus to maintain the chromosome structure in a stable state. But in a cancer cell those regions often become hypomethylated. It leads to active transposition, activation of cryptic promoters which are normally switched off and to disruptions in genes structure. The structure of chromosomes also becomes unstable and we can observe alterations in the karyotype due to deletions, insertions and/or translocations. It all results in aberrant transcription and, as a consequence, in abnormal metabolic processes in the cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, at the H19/Igf2 locus the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. This preserves it from CTCF binding and thus allows distantly located enhancers to promote transcription of Igf2. At the same time the methyl mark is spread to the nearby region containing H19 gene, which results in its silencing. At the maternal allele ICR is not methylated, which allows CTCF to bind it. As a result, CTCF insulates enhancers' effect on Igf2, which leads to its silencing, and enhancers then act to promote still available H19 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour we can observe Igf2 overexpression due to hypermethylation of ICR: ICR becomes methylated not only on the paternal, but on the maternal allele too. It results in a situation that both alleles behave as if being paternal and both are expressing Igf2. Thus we have a double dose of Igf2 being produced and no H19 in the transformed cell. Since Igf2 promotes cell growth, the cell begins to divide uncontrollably, which leads to development of a tumour.</p></div>
