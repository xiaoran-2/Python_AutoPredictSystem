    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, DNA methylation does not occur directly at the CpG islands, but close to them (CpG island shores). In cancer cells, the epigenetic machinery is disrupted and hypermethylation therefore occurs at the CpG islands causing silencing of the gene controlled by this CpG island. When the methylation process is disrupted, there tends to more an increase in genomic instability, deregulation of normal gene expression and silencing of tumor-suppressor genes.</p>
<p>As for the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, these tend to be methylated in normal cells and hypomethylated in cancerous cells. The result of hypomethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements is genomic instability where recombination and transposition events and disruption of the surrounding genes may occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions are important parts of the genome. In normal cells, DNA methylation at the imprint control regions blocks binding of the CTCF and methylation is spread to the H19 promoter causing its silencing. Enhancers are then able to bind to the paternal Igf2 and drive its expression. The maternal allele is somewhat different. There is no methylation at the imprint control region, so the CTCF is able to bind there and enhancers can then bind to the maternal H19 allele and drive its expression. Therefore CTCF insulates maternal Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. In all, only the paternal allele of Igf2 and the maternal allele of H19 are expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, methylation at the maternal imprint control region mimics what is seen on the paternal allele. That is a block in H19 expression and the ability of enhancers to bind Igf2 and drive its expression. The result is more Igf2 expression and no H19 expression. This may contribute to disease because Igf2 does support proliferation while H19 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene. A lack of H19 can contribute to overexpression and proliferation of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent in the DNMTi class of drug therapies. Decitabine inhibits methylation from occurring in DNA. Tumor tissues tend to have hypermethylation at the CpG islands, therefore this drug will incorporate into the DNA, bind the DNMT and inhibit further methylation at the CpG islands. This reduces the epigenetic marks seen in tumor tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation has effects on the epigenome by modifying specific and imprinted gene expression and increasing genomic instability. The sensitive periods are time frames in which the altered environment can control the epigenetic mechanisms. This occurs during primordial germ cell and early development when the pre-existing epigenetic marks are erased and new ones are laid down. It is inadbisable to treat patients during these periods as there could be effects on the non-developed germ cells (in females). These cells would then have altered epigenetic makeup leading to activation or silencing of different genes.</p></div>
