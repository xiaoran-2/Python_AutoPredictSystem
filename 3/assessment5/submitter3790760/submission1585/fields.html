    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normally functioning cell, DNA is not methylated or is poorly methylated at CpG islands (hypomethylation), which allows for methylation of DNA further along the genome. However, in cancer cells, DNA is more likely to be methylated at CpG islands (hypermethylation), which does not allow methylation further along the genome (hypomethylation). When DNA methylation is disrupted at CpG islands, then, effectively silences tumor suppressor genes. This is an advantage to the cell, as it does not die off as readily as normal cells, which can perpetuate the cancer further. Each type of cancer seems to have its own pattern of methylation at CpG islands, which can help to identify cancer cells from normal cells. Also of note, this methylation of CpG islands increases in frequency in a genome over time, leading to more chance of cancer in elderly patients.</p>
<p>In a normally functioning cell, DNA is methylated at intergenic regions and at repetitive elements in a normally functioning cell. However, in a cancer cell, DNA is not methylated at intergenic regions and repetitive elements as it would be in a normally functioning cell. When DNA methylation is less common in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, those regions would be more likely to be transcribed (where they would not be in normal cells). As many of these regions are linked to cell growth, allowing for transcription will allow for further cell growth, leading to a higher potential for cancer. If epigenetic treatments are given for the unmethylation of CpG islands (or otherwise an important biomarker), then there will likely be a consequence of remethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, leading to a normally functioning cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to the development of cancer, as seen in the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster:</p>
<p><strong>Normal cell:</strong> In a paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated, so H19 is silenced. The enhancers work on the Igf2 gene, then, to enhance expression.</p>
<p>In a maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing for binding of CTCF and enhancement of H19 expression. Igf2 is silent on the maternale allele.</p>
<p><strong>Wilm's Tumor:</strong> Both maternal and paternal alleles are methylated in Wilm's Tumor, leading to overexpression of Igf2 and lack of H19 expression. Igf2 promotes cell growth, which leads to disease of cells, such as cancer (and in this case, Wilm's tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylator. This has the ability to remove methyl groups from DNA, allowing for expression of genes that are unable to be expressed when the methyl groups are present. The genes Decitabine removes methyl groups from, then, are often associated with tumor supressor genes. When activated (without methylation, caused by Decitabine's effect), these genes can work to have an anti-tumor effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As DNA methylation is altered, different parts of the genome can be expressed. For instance, if methylation is added, genes can be effectively silenced. On the other hand, if DNA is demethylated, a once-suppressed gene can now be expressed. This epigenome can be passed on throughout cellular generations, leading to a change in cell function that lasts beyond drug treatment.</p>
<p>A period of time where a patient should not receive those drugs is during a sensitive period. A sensitive period is one in early development in which there is a reprogramming of methylation on the genome, which allows for certain genes to be readily expressed while others are not. The sensitive periods are specifically during the formation of the blastocyst and the creation of primordial germ cells, which form gametes. If a patient were to be treated during sensitive periods, their genome could be incorrectly methylated, leading to several forms of disease (not just cancer), which would persist as the cells grow and reproduce through generations of ineffective cells.</p></div>
