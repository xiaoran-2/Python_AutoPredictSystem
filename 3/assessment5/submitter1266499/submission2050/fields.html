    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation of CpG islands in gene promoter regions generally promotes transcriptional silencing. Methylation may decrease the rate of binding of gene transcriptional proteins, as well as bind to methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). MBDs recruit enzymes that condense the chromatin structure to form heterochromatin, which is transcriptionally inactive. In normal cells, CpG islands located in the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes have relatively little methylation, allowing for normal expression of proteins that regulate the cell cycle or promote apoptosis. However, in cancer cells, these CpG islands are hypermethylated, leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. This silencing may result in dysregulation of the cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis, leading to rapid and uncontrolled growth. Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells of dividing cancer cells will also have silenced tumor suppressor genes. As a result, the cancer cells are able to grow and divide rapidly to form a tumor.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. Intergenic regions are methylated to silence cryptic transcription start sites that can interfere with normal gene transcription and cryptic splice sites that can interfere with normal gene splicing. Repetitive elements are methylated to prevent mutagenic transposition due to gag and pol proteins, to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and to prevent illegitimate recombination between repeats. In cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated. This hypomethylation leads to genomic instability as a result of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighboring genes. This genomic instability leads to deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations that enhance tumorigenesis by generating mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that lead to unregulated cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) of the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster is methylated, so CTCF cannot bind to the ICR. <em>Igf2</em> is not insulated by CTCF, so its expression is enhanced by downstream enhancers. As a result, <em>Igf2</em> is expressed in the paternal allele but not the maternal allele. As a result of heterochromatin spreading, the <em>H19 </em>promoter also becomes methylated, causing <em>H19</em> to be silenced.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. H19 is produced from the maternal but not the paternal allele. Since the imprint control region is unmethylated, it is bound by CTCF, a protein that insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers, so <em>Igf2</em> is not expressed. The enhancers thus enhance the expression of <em>H19</em> instead, due to the formation of an alternate chromatin loop. </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele. The lack of the imprinting on both alleles leads to loss of expression of <em>Cdkn1c</em>, a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits growth, and upregulation of <em>Igf2</em>, an oncogene that stimulates growth. The overall effect is thus promotion of cell growth, which may lead to the formation of Wilm’s tumor, a kidney cancer primarily found in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. As a chemical analog of the nucleoside cytidine, it is incorporated into DNA strands in place of cytidine. When the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 encounters decitabine incorporated into DNA, it remains bound to decitabine and becomes inactivated. This inhibition of DNMT1 results in a loss of DNA methylation. This leads to a decrease in methylation of CpG islands at tumor suppressor gene promoters, resulting in increased expression of tumor suppressors. Tumor suppressors generally act to regulate the cell cycle or promote apoptosis (programmed cell death). Tumor suppressor proteins can repair DNA damage that may lead to inactivation of other tumor suppressors or activation of oncogenes, repress genes that stimulate cell cycle progression, inhibit cell cycle progression when DNA damage is present, initiate apoptosis when irreparable DNA damage is present, and/or promote cell adhesion to inhibit tumor metastasis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome since the methylation of CpG sites is maintained by maintenance methyltransferases such as DNMT1. After mitosis, each daughter DNA molecule contains one strand from the parent (which contains the parent cell’s methylation marks) and one newly synthesized strand (which is unmethylated). DNMT1 methylates hemimethylated CpG sites to establish the parent cell’s methylation pattern on the newly synthesized strand so that DNA methylation patterns are passed on through mitosis.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of active remodeling of the epigenome, during which there is a general removal of DNA methylation in the paternal and maternal genomes, followed by a re-establishment of DNA methylation in a lineage-specific fashion. The first wave of reprogramming occurs during pre-implantation early development, and the second wave occurs during primordial germ cell development. Treating patients during sensitive periods could lead to disruption of epigenetic reprogramming, which may result in imprinting defects. Generally, imprinted genes from the paternal chromosome drive embryo growth, while imprinted genes from the maternal chromosome inhibit embryo growth, so disruption of this balance between imprinted genes may lead to growth abnormalities of the embryo.</p></div>
