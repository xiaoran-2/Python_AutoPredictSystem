    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated (and so the genes are less silenced to be expresed), but in a cancer cell they are hypermethylated. They can do this in the promotors of the tumor suppressors genes, by epigenetic or genetic mechanisms.  Epigenetically by silencing the tumor suppressor gene by locking in acyl active state (to adding a methyl group) and since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. The genome in general (repetitive elments, intergenic elements and introns) are hypomethylated.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer by adding methyl groups and 2Kb in the shores (CpG islands shores).  When this CpG islands corresponds to a promoter of tumor suppressor gene, and now it is hypermethylated, this “silencing” is broke and there is any suppressor and these genes pro-cancer can be expressed.</p>
<p>The ICRs (imprinting control regions) in a normal cell are methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. With loss of imprinting there is hypermethylation of this inprinting control regions on the maternal allele as well (an example of this is Wilms tumour, in children).  This is associated with growth promoting (e.g. IGF2).</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up of intergenic intervals or repetitive elements or other places where in general it would find the CpG’s were methylated in a normal cell. But in cancer, these regions tend to become hypomethylated (less methylation compare with a normal cell).  Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease since they can make many copies of the same repetitive gene and not maintain genomic stability. The regions are repetitive between genes and the consequence of this are illegitimate recombination between repets (e.g. reciprocal translocations).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICRs (imprinting control regions) in a normal cell are methylated on the paternal allele, and unmethylated on the maternal allele. With loss of imprinting there is hypermethylation of this inprinting control regions on the maternal allele as well (an example of this is Wilms tumour, in children).  This is associated with growth promoting (e.g. IGF2). that means that we have double dose of IGF2 incomparison with a normal cell.  that occurs as a very early event, it is often seen in preneoplasic tissues and might be very early events in tumour regenesis.</p>
<p>These alterations in DNA at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation) can results in loss of expression of growht restricting genes, overexpression of growht promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of azacitidine (sold as Vidaza) and decitabine (sold as Dacogen), are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. Among histone modifications, there is an increased mutation rate in regions of heterocromatin, also there is hypermethylated CGIs (collaboration with DNA methylation changes). These genes are enriched for PCR2 targets (H3K27me) in ESC (embrionic stem cells). in a normal cell H3K4 is methylated, in a cancer cell this methylation decreased. In a normal cell H3 and H4 are acethylated, but in cancer cells this acethylation is decreased.</p>
<p>The Dna methylation is context dependent (we have both hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor genes and hypermethylation gene in wide), then this demethylation drives by tumour suppresor nypermethylation, then depletion of methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>A combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Effect of DNA methylation depletion can be stage specific, e.g. early vs late in tumorigenesis, then the implications for effectiveness of epigenetic theraphy in tumours with these dependencies. an example is DNMT1. the DNMT1 null embryos (mice) an embryo that has no DNA methyltranferase 1, will die around mid gestation. but when we have decreased or not levels of DNMT1 just in particular tissues, the animal doesn't inmediatly die. This role of the DNA methylation in that particular organ (cells area) make that the mouse ends up getting cancer (but not dies). In other words, to get rid of DNA methylation increased genomic inestability in that particular tissue, and then they end up with a prticular type of cance.</p>
<p>very early in tumorigenesis, it may depend on one, as in the preneoplastic state, and then very late, maybe at the invasion or metastasis stage, their dependency will change. this hat effectiveness of epigenetics drugs, which tarteting epigenetics mistakes, and when is the most appropiated time for a treatment with a drug which inhibits DNA methylation, it can be effective late or early. That need to be addressed, individual type of tumor at different stages of desease.</p></div>
