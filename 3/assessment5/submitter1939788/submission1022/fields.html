    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>In general CpG islands are not methylated across the genome. A somatic cell maintains DNA methylation, including of some CpG islands, to prevent transcription of genes not required for its type, eg skin cells do not express the genes related to liver tissues. In this way cells maintain stable specialisation throughout the lifetime of the organism while the cells themselves go through many mitotic cycles.</p>
<p>As cancer progresses the frequency of DNA methylation at CpG islands increases resulting in increased transcriptional silencing, in particular of tumour suppressor genes, although which specific CpG islands are hypermethylated varies by tumour type. As tumour suppressor genes are silenced tumourogenesis increases and cancer tissue growth accelerates. Because DNA methylation at CpG islands is mitotically heritable, tumour cells with CpG island hypermethylation will tend to reproduce faster passing on the tumour suppressor hypermethylation leading to it becoming predominant in a tumour.</p>
<p>Cells in normal function methylate and heterochromatise intergenic regions and repetitive elements to suppress illegitimate recombination and to prevent their activation. This maintains genomic stability by protecting the genome from deletions, translocations and insertions, all of which can disrupt coding of genes or cause unwanted activation of genes, leading to aberrant outcomes.</p>
<p>In cancer, there is progressive DNA hypomethylation across the genome, despite CpG island hypermethylation occuring, as tissues progress from normal tissue to hyperplasia to neoplasia and tumour invasion. The hypomethylation affects the intergenic and repetitive elements causing genomic instability from, for instance, illegitimate recombination and activation of genes and promoters in repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This can cause unwanted activation of genes, eg oncogenes, or disrupt normal transcription, eg of tumour suppressor genes, causing disruption of normal cell function. Hypomethylation also removes epigenetic marks maintaining cell type contributing to loss of specialisation in tumour cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting disruption causes aberrant gene expression which can cause up-regulation of oncogenes or loss of growth suppression. Symptoms can include a predisposition to tumours, including in childhood or the embryo.  Wilm’s tumour in children is symptomatic of imprinting disruption in the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally imprinted. DNA methylation of the paternal allele imprint control region (ICR) prevents binding of the CTFT insulator protein. Without this, the downstream promoters can affect the Igf2 gene causing its expression.</p>
<p>The maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster lacks methylation at the ICR. CTFT can bind and block the promotion of Igf2, so silencing Igf2 expression on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, paternal allele imprinting replaces maternal allele imprinting (through paternal uniparental disomy, genetic mutation, or, rarely, by disruption of epigenetic marks). Paternal imprinting on both alleles means no maternal allele Igf2 silencing - there is ICR methylation on both alleles, CTFT cannot bind to either, so the downstream promoters act on the Igf2 gene on both alleles causing over-expression of Igf2. In this way, disrupted imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease through over-expression of the oncogene Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine may be used to treat the areas of epigenetic hypermethylation that occur in the cell geneome in tumours, eg hypermethylation of CpG islands. Decitabine is a small molecule inhibitor which targets epigenetic regulator enzymes. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>The mitotic heritability of DNA methylation is disrupted by the Decitabine DNMT inhibitor effect. In DNA replication DNMT1 repeatedly binds to DNA to replicate methylation to DNA daughter strands. Decitabine causes DNMT1 to bind irreversibly to the DNA so it cannot replicate methylation further. Without daughter strand methylation, continued tumour cell replication progressively erodes hypermethylation, similar to pre-implantation epigenomic reprogramming of the maternal genome.</p>
<p>Tumours show hypermethylation of CpG islands which silences transcription of tumour suppressor genes. As tumour cells replicate, Decitabine, through its DNMT inhibitor effect, reduces CpG island hypermethylation as methylation is not passed on to daughter cell DNA and transcription of tumour suppressor genes resumes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has enduring effects as methylation is a stable marking of DNA involving a strong carbon-carbon bond. Epigenetic mechanisms exist to matain DNA methylation throughout the soma for the lifetime of an organism, eg DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Epigenetic marks are however reversible, unlike genetic mutations. If a drug modifies DNA methylation in a tumour cell genome, it is maintained in the cell and passed to its descendant cells well after the period of treatment.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are two main times in an organism's lifecyle when the whole epigenome is espeically sensitive to the environment: first, the period from primordial germ cell development to mature gamete production;and second, embryonic development from zygote to epiblast. In these periods cells complete essential epigenetic reprogramming across the entire genome - actively removing and laying down new DNA methylation throughout.</p>
<p>During the sensitive periods, patient treatment with drugs that actively inhibit or enhance the removal or laying down of DNA methylation, a powerful change to the cellular environment, risks disrupting genome-wide reprogramming possibly causing whole organism harm. Drugs today capable of tumour cell DNA methylation changes may also change methylation in non-tumour cells disrupting normal cell function.</p></div>
