    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at Cpg islands in a promoter region of particular gene usually couses silencing. In cancer CpG island of tumor suppressor gene (TSG) may be methylated and silenced, methylated oncogene is unmethylated so activated. Downregulation of TSG by its CpG methylation couses of that cells inability to repress cellular events such as prolifaration or anti-apoptotic events. Upregulation of oncogenes may activate cellular pathways such as proliferation,metastasis,angiogenesis etc.DNA methylation in intergenic regions could act as supressor of alternative start points for expression of that particular gene and methylation of repetitive elements serves as a way of condensing(tightly packeging) that part of DNA to prevent unproper recombination between similar regions of non-allelic or non homologous chromosomes. Disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic region may result in alternative transcripts of that gene altering its protein function, disruption in repetitive elements may lead to recombination of two non homologous chromosomes (like brc/abl transolation) leading to overexpression of traslocated gene under strong promoter in the translocated region.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>in willms syndrome maternal and paternal insulators are methylated so both paternal and maternal igf2 genes are expressed. this overexpression leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation that is seen in childhood tumor of kidney. Normally in paternal allele insulator that is located downstream of igf2 is methylated so CTCF will not be able to bind to this region thus allowingİn  downstream enhancers to activate igf2. In maternal allele insulator is unmethylated and CTCF prevents igf2 expression by bynding to insulator.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine is a dnmt inhibitor. it is a nucleoside homologue. its incorporation to DNA sequence couses DNMT enzyme to be bind irreversibly when DNMT is attempting methylate this region (that includes decitabine). Tumor cells that are concidered as actively proliferating thus effected by this agent because DNMT that can not be released from DNA, disrupts DNA replication process of that tumor cell leading these cells to death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>methylation pattern of DNA is mitotically heritable and DNMT1 makes it possible which functions as 'replicator' of mathylated pattern betwwen newly synthesised and old strands of DNA when cell divides. sensitive period is the period of time when there is an active process of epigenetic reprogramming e.g. in newly fertilized egg and in primordial germ cells.</p></div>
