    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation at CpG Islands normally silences or inactivates genes that contribute to the growth of cancers.  Alterations in DNA that hypomethylate these areas allow cancer promoter genes to turn on and be transcribed.  Conversely, DNA Hypermethylation of tumour suppressing genes may silence the gene and allow tumours to grow in a newly unihibited environment.  Integenic regions and repetitive elements are typically methylated in normal cells, but frequently become hypomethylated in cancerous cells.<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-2763e406cf05d6d06b4d970b/970238/asst-5/970238-52130dc6d46fe2.93214055.pdf">DNA Methylation at CpG Islands.pdf</a><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the Paternal Allele , the ICR is is normally methylated.  In the Maternal Allele, the ICR is normally unmethylated and this allows CTCF to bind to it.  This allows enhancer regions to act on the H19 region while the Igf2 region is silent and no gene expression occurs.  In contrast, the Paternal allele has Igf2 expression because CTCF is not bound to the ICR.  After a loss of imprinting, hypermethylation of the Maternal ICR occurs and Igf2 is overexpressed via both alleles transcribing the Igf2 gene.  This is a critical factor in the formation of Wilm's tumour in children.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor that acts as a DNA demethylating agent.  This drug enhances DNA Hypomethylation on genes that triggered cancer via DNA Hypermethylation.  The reduction of methylation induced by Decitabine is enough to turn gene regulation back on where it had been silenced.  This works when tumour suppressor genes need to be turned back on.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once the drug altered pattern of DNA methylation takes place, the change passes on to daughter cells later.  Erasing a cancer inducing epigenetic change will prevent the return of the epigenetic alteration from that point onward in daughter cells.  This epigenetic drugs seem to trigger an enduring change in the cancer cells that makes them become much more reponsive to standard chemotherapy treatments that otherwise would not work.  Early life is a sensitive period for normal epigenetic change and alteration of the genome.  Treatment with drugs during this period could seriously disrupt normal epigenetic programming. </p>
