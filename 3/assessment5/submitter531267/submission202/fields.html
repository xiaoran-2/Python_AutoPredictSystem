    <h1>Submission 202 from Anon (session_user_id: e9e8bdd82265707dde939004461f56773f0ef2cb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable.  When a cell prepares for mitosis and the DNA is replicated, the DNA methylation is copied from the parent strand to the daughter strand of DNA by a DNA methylation enzyme like DMT1.  In this way, the epigenetic mark is preserved through cell division and endures even after the drug is gone.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one in which epigenetic marks can be changed by exposure to certain environments or chemicals.  For many epigenetic marks, the sensitive period corresponds with the normal clearing and re-establishment of most epigenetic marks that occurs in the pre-implantation phase of embryonic development and during development of primordial germ cells.  </p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable during sensitive periods because they could disrupt the establishment of normal epigenetic marks.  If the presence or absence of these marks is altered, that change persists, sometimes for the lifetime of the organism and potentially having dire consequences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands leads to tighter packaging of the DNA such that it becomes inaccessible to transcription machinery.  Thus, DNA methlyation effectively inactivates the region of DNA.  In normal, healthy tissue, CpG islands are hypomethylated.  In cancer, specific CpG islands, usually those associated with tumor suppressor genes, may become hypermethylated.  When these genes are inactivated, the tumor suppressor is no longer produced, and the cell is one step closer to being cancerous.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements again leads to tighter packing of the DNA.  Sometimes the effect is to directly inactivate a region.  But it can also act as a "landing pad" for proteins that bind to methylated DNA.  In normal, healthy tissue these regions are hypermethylated.  In cancer, they tend to be hypomethylated.  The activation of the repetitive elements leads to genomic instability, and thus cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Typically the paternal allele of the ICR at this locus is methylated.  When it is methylated, CTCF cannot bind and the enhancers in the region activate the paternal allele of <em>Igf2</em>.  The maternal allele of the ICR is unmethylated.  CTCF binds, blocking the enhancers from activating <em>Igf2 </em>which instead now activate the maternal allele of <em>H19.</em>  In individuals that have Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is methylated and behaves in the same way as the paternal allele.  <em>H19</em> is no longer expressed, but more importantly, <em>Igf2 </em>is now overexpressed. Igf2 is a growth factor.  Its overexpression leads to too much cell division, resulting in the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMTi (DNA methyltransferase inhibitor).  It is a nucleoside analogue that becomes incorporated into DNA during DNA replication.  Then, when DNMT binds, it becomes irreversibly bound.  The end result is DNA demethylation.  If this occurs at abnormally hypermethylated CpG islands, they will now be hypomethylated as in normal, healthy tissue as described above.</p></div>
