    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are generally found at gene promoters. Methylation of one of these <br />islands blocks the promoter it is situated at, therefore silencing gene expression.<br />It is an important mechanism in the formation of heterochromatin. CpG islands are <br />usually unmethylated in actively transcribed genes. In cancer though, CpG island <br />methylation is often found near tumour supressor genes, blocking their expression <br />and aiding the aberrant growth of cancer cells. Disruption of CpG island <br />methylation can lead to inappropriate expression/overexpression of genes which can <br />lead to various negative outcomes for the subject dependent on the gene in <br />question. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is a <br />safeguard to ensure genomic stability. Cancer disables this safeguard by removing <br />methylation in these places. Disruption of methylation in intergenic regions and <br />repetitive elements increases the risk of illicit transposition events like <br />deletions, insertions and translocation of gene parts.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster is located between the <br />Igf2 gene (upstream of ICR) and the H19 gene (downstream of ICR). Furthermore, <br />downstream of H19 sits a series of enhancers. On the maternal allele, the <br />unmethylated ICR facilitates the binding of CTCF, which acts as an insulator that <br />blocks the enhancers from reaching Igf2 and leads them to target H19 instead. On <br />the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the methylated ICR, therefore the <br />enhancers activate Igf2 expression, while DNA methylation spreads from the ICR to <br />H19. Loss of imprinting on the maternal allele leads to overexpression of Igf2, <br />which is an oncogene. Furthermore, the H19/Igf2 cluster is linked with the Kcnq1 <br />cluster, which on the paternal allele suppresses the expression of Cdkn1c (a tumour <br />suppressor). This combination is ideal for aberrant growth, like in Wilm's tumour <br />for example. Loss of imprinting is often observed in cancer as a lot of imprinted <br />genes (like Igf2) are related to growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT (de novo methyltransferase) inhibitor. DNMTs are involved in <br />laying down and maintaining DNA methylation. After mitosis of a previously <br />methylated cell, the new cells are hemi-methylated (methylated on only one strand) <br />until DNMTs complete the methylation again. DNMT inhibitors bind DNMTs, so they <br />cannot maintain DNA methylation, how exactly this is accomplished though is not yet <br />clear. Subsequent cell division cycles will further decrease the methylation level, <br />increasing for example the (previously blocked) expression of tumour suppressor <br />genes therefore slowing or even halting tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. That means epigenetic marks are <br />maintained over subsequent cell divisions. There are two major periods were <br />epigenetic marks are cleared and subsequently reset: During 1. early development <br />(pre-implantation period) and 2. primordial germ cell (PGC) development. Disruption <br />of these periods of epigenetic reprogramming can lead to a multitude of negative <br />effects for the subject. Incomplete clearing or failure to reestablish epigenetic <br />marks during early development can lead, for example, to imprinting disorders. In <br />the case of PGC development, disruption can lead to possible defects in the <br />subjects progeny, hamper his ability to create viable offspring or even render the <br />subject sterile. It therefore is not recommended to treat patients with epigenetic <br />drugs during onset of puberty.</p></div>
