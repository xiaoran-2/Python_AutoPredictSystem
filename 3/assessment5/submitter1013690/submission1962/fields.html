    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpGs (cyosine followed by guanine) found near promoters of genes.  These islands are often protected against methylation, because when methyl groups do bind to them, gene expression is slienced.  In cancer cells, these usually unmethylated islands are much more likely to be methylated.  Where these CpG islands exist near the promoters of tumor supressors, their methylation will silence the supressors and allow tumors to grow.  Hypermethylation of CpG islands thereby contributes to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, but are hypomethylated in cancer cells.  In normal cells, DNA methylations at intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription, minimizing genomic instability (e.g. deletions, insertions, duplications, and translocations of genetic data).  Similarly, methylation of repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats, thereby preventing transposition and illegitimate recombination.   When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, as in cancer cells, their stabilizing influences are lost.  While the specific consequences vary by tumor type and location, hypomethylation of these regions occurs in all tumors and increases as the tumors grow.   The resulting instability includes activation of previously silenced repeats, transposition, illegitimate recombination, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption to other genes positioned nearby.   Specific tumor types may be generated by either DNA hypomethylation (and associated chromosomal instability) or CpG island hypermethylation, or in some cases, both at different stages of tumor development.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/lgf2 cluster is located on human chromosome 2, and includes lgf2 (an oncogene, or growth promoter) and Cdkn1c (a tumor supressor). This region is typically protected by an insulator protein called CTCF, which limits expression of lgf2 from downstream enhancers.  However, where the impriting control region (ICR) is methylated, CTCF binding is blocked and the methylation extends to the H19 promotor.  Silencing of this promotor allows enhancers to activate lgf2. </p>
<p>Maintaining balance of this oncogene (lgf2) and tumor supressor (Cdkn1c) are clearly important in normal cells.  Typically this region is paternally imprinted.  The paternal allele is methylated, allowing activation of lgf2 and supression of Cdkn1c.  The maternal allele is typically unmethylated, restricting lgf2 and promoting Cdkn1c.  If imprinting is disrupted, the maternal allele may become methylated.  In this case, two paternal-like alleles are present (as in Wilm's tumour), causing a critical depletion of the tumor supressor Cdkn1c and upregulation of the growth promoter lgf2.  These factors lead to fetal and postnatal overgrowth, macrocglossia, and tumors during embryonic and childhood phases.  In Wilm's tumor, these are focused in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi), effectively disrupt DNA methylation by irreversibly binding to DNMTs in the genome.  This treatment prevents methylation, which inhibits tumor growth if the root of the problem is hypermethylation of CpG islands.  The CGI hypermethylation leads to silencing of tumor supressors; when these are unmethylated, the tumor supressors can again be expressed, allowing the body's own biomechanics to combat tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>While drugs that alter DNA methylation may successfully be used to treat some cancers, there may be lasting effects because epigenetic markers are mitotically heritable.  As cells divide, the marker changes which resulted from treatment will be passed along to the daughter cells.  Additionally, epigenetic treatments can not be targeted to specific cells, but rather take effect throughout the body. </p>
<p>Adjustment to epigenetic markers is particularly risky during sensitive periods (periods when genetic markers are cleared and re-established, such as during primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation embryonic development).  Of particular concern is the effect that epigenetic treaments may have for children whose germ cells are still developing.  While treatment may effectively alter the expression of genes in the patient, epigenetic changes in the germ cells could cause alterations in the phenotype of their eventual offspring.  Likewise these treatments should be avoided for pregnant women.</p></div>
