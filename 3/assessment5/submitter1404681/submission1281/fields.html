    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Over activity of DNA methyl-transferase which results in DNA hyper-methylation is common characteristic of cancer cells. DNA Hyper-methylation may cause <strong>silencing of tumor suppressor genes</strong>, whose job is to stop uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. <strong>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents</strong>. Being a cytosine analogue (2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine), Decitabine is incorporated into the DNA and inhibit the action of DNA methyl- transferase <strong>by establishing of a covalent bond</strong> between the cytosine and the enzyme. Such inhibition results in DNA methylation reduction. Which in turn may re-activated the silenced tumor-suppressor genes</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>In the normal cell the Igf2 ICR (imprint control region) <strong>is methylated</strong> on the paternal allele, and it's <strong>un-methylated</strong> on the maternal allele. The maternal un-methylated ICR binds an isolator and as a result the maternal Igf2 allele is silenced (not expressed). On the other hand, The ICR reagion of the paternal allele is <strong>methylated,</strong> so the isolator can’t bind to it. As a result, the paternal Igf2 allele is expressed. Wilm’s tumour is characterized by loss of imprinting which results in Igf2 ICR methylation of both parental alleles, which leads to Igf2 over expression (“double dose”). Igf2 is a <strong>growth factor</strong>, and it’s over expression is associated with Wilm's tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is <strong>mitotically inherited</strong>; hence, if the methylation profile of a cell is altered by epigenetic drug, this change will be mitotically inherited by all daughter cells so the drug’s effect will last beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are the period <strong>after fertilization (fertilized egg stage up to epiblast stage)</strong> and the period of <strong>gametogenesis</strong> in which <strong>reprograming of DNA methylation  occurs </strong>(an example for such reprograming is the process of fertilized egg differentiation)</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during the sensitive period may result in improper genome re-programing. For example, using the drug Decitabine - an epigenetic inhibitor belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents, May results in hypo-methylation which in turn may cause over-expression of genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation <strong>at CpG islands</strong>,which appears mainly in gene promotors, is<strong> silencing of gene expression</strong>.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands may contribute to cancer development by <strong>hyper-methylation </strong>which may cause<strong> gene silencing of a tumor suppressor gene</strong> on one hand, and may cause <strong>over-expression of an oncogene</strong> on the other hand.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation <strong>of repetitive elements</strong> is to <strong>improve genome stability</strong> by preventing non legitimate recombination between repeats. In addition, methylated repetitive elements are genetically inactive and can’t create more copies of themselves or transpose into other places in the genome.</p>
<p>In cancer, <strong>genome-wide DNA hypo-methylation</strong> is occur, which results in <strong>genome instability</strong> due to non-legitimate recombination between repeats and active transposable elements, which may randomly incorporate into the genome <strong>activating oncogenes</strong> or <strong>knockdown tumor suppressor genes</strong> by chance. In addition,<span class="mejs-captions-text"><strong>CpG poor promoters become hypomethylated</strong> in cancer, and may in turn activate silenced oncogenes (Foe example <span class="mejs-captions-text">R-RAS in gastric cancer)</span></span></p>
