    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, found in promoter regions, especially of tumor suppressor genes, are normally unmethylated. In cancer, these are often methylated, shutting down transcription of these genes. This means that factors that might normally regulate cell growth and the cell cycle are not transcribed, thus facilitating unregulated cell division characteristic of cancer.</p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions and repetitive elements show high levels of methylation and heterochromatization. In cancerous cells we observe that they may become hypomethylated and euchromatinized, which can lead to activation of formerly suppressed genes. This, in turn, can produce expression of oncogenes which block apoptosis and lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Hypomethylation can also produce reversion of cells to an unspecialized, stem-cell-like state, as normally repressed genes are activated. It can further produce produce genomic instability. Loss of methylation of repetitive and intergenic sequences can allow repetitive elements to transpose, produce recombination events between non-homologous chromosomes, promote transcription of neighboring genes by way of embedded cryptic promoters or insert themselves into active genes, disrupting them. All of these are characteristic properties of the cancer state.</p>
<p>Epigenetic alterations leading to cancer may be produced through a series of cellular stresses, producing mutations in genes coding for various epigenetic regulators, such as TET genes, which code for DNA demethylases, DNA Methylase (DNMT) genes and Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) protein genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the paternal Imprinting Control Region and region upstream from the H19 gene (coding for a cell cycle regulator) are methylated. This means that the lgf2, coding for a growth factor, is expressed. In the female allele, the ICR and H19 are unmethylated and allow the binding of CTCF to the ICR, which which acts as an insulator element and blocks transcription of lgf2 by RPII, and instead allows transcription of the H19 gene. In the case of Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR becomes hypermethylated, producing overexpression of the lgf2 gene product, leading to the symptoms of the tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns persist through mitotic cell division for the life of the organism. Following DNA replication, the parental strand methylation patterns serve as a model for methylation of newly synthesized daughter strands, by way of maintenance methyltransferases, such as DNMT1. Thus, any effect on adult somatic genome methylation patterns in a cancer cell would persist in all of its daughter cells. However, there are sensitive periods, during which parental cell epigenetic markers are erased and new markers laid down These periods occur during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development, and are preparatory to epigenetic reprogramming appropriate, respectively, to the gene expressions of germ cells and embryonic stem cells and subsequent cell lineages. If introduced during these periods, epigenetic drugs could impede proper germ cell formation and cell differentiation. For example drugs used by Baylin include a histone deacetylase inhibitor and a DNA demethylating agent. The former could lead to inappropriate transcriptomes for the given cell type, as histone acetylation is associated with active genes. The latter would have a similar effect, as DNA methylation is associated with gene inactivation. If introduced during sensitive periods, these drugs could also produce genomic instability, as repetitive elements remain unmethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which works by irreversibly binding to the DNMT's active site following incorporation into the DNA strand. Consequently, it leads to hypomethylation of the genome. Since hypermethylation of CpG islands, shores and ICRs is associated with tumorigenesis, leading to characteristic properties of cancer, such as repression of tumor-suppressor genes (uncontrolled cell division) and loss of imprinting (de-differentiation of cells), Decacitabine can potentially restore normal function to the affected cells.</p></div>
