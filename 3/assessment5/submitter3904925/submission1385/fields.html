    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation means the addition of a methyl group to the DNA, which usually be found at cytosine in CpG dinucleotides. that The normal function of DNA methylation are to keep the stability of the genome and silence the targeting gene. In cancer cells, we can find the CpG island is hypermethylated and leads to silence the tumor supressor gene which cause cancer.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetive elements the genes, the normal cells always show hypermethylated, which helped enhance the genes' stability. Mouse models and the evidence from many human cancers can support the conclusion. In cancer cells' genes, there are  hypothylation in genome-wide to make the genes become more instable, such as deletions, insertions, reciprocal,translocation ect. Hypermethylation can silencing gene, on the contrast, the hypomethlation can activate gene. So  the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can lead to cancer by acticating the oncogene.</p>
<p>In conclusion, DNA methylation can contribute to cancer which is context dependent relates to replication timing. Different tumors have different dependencies. They may be caused by tumor supressor hypermethylation or chromosomal instabilitu.Effect of Methylation is different between them. We remove the methylation in CpGs islands can enhance the suppressor tumorigenesis , however, in genome-wide can enchance the tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated on the parternal allele and make the enhancers to act in the Igf2 rather than the H19.  Otherwise than paternal allele, the maternal allele's imprint control region is unmethylated, which can to combine the CTCF and then express the H19 rather than the Igf2.</p>
<p>In wilm's tumor, both maternal and paternal alleles' imprint control  are methylated, so there will be twofold dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting that is associate with Wilm's tumor. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitors,  belongs to DNMTi which is FDA approved. The Decitabine has similar function to 5-Azacytidine, they are all nucleoside analogs. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication so that the DNMTi can bind the nucleotide to inhibit the methyltransferase to bind the nucleotide.</p>
<p>The inhibitors is division dependend, you must have cell replication.  And the cancer gene has more cell replications.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we know DNA methylation is inheritable, which means the changes can be passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisisms. This period is called sensitive period.</p>
<p>The time of sensitive period of development is when organizational gonadal hormones establish the sexually dimorphic brain.</p>
<p>If the drugs is given during the sensitive period, the drugs' ability to attack the neighboring normal cell will be increased and will destroy the normal cells. It will have strong side affects.</p></div>
