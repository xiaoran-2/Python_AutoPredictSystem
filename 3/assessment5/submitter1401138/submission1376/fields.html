    <h1>Submission 1376 from Anon (session_user_id: 3896879bdd2444ff16dd99c98cdddd922ec6d7ca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that inhibits DNA Methyltransferase. Decitabine would then decrease the degree of methylation on DNA which can be beneficial to the supression of some tumours that contain hypermethylated CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation regulates the expression of promoter genes. Usually CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer, these genes may become hypermethylated thus downregulating cell growth restriction genes and upregulating cell growth promoter genes.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetetive elements, DNA methylation acts as a protector of genomic integrity ensuring genomic stability. In cancer, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements may become hypomethylated, leading to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is normally methylated. This methylation enhances the expression of Igf2 while silencing H19. When the maternal ICR is methylated, the region acts just like the paternal allele, promoting aberrant cell growth which results in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and promoting the formation of Wilm's tumour. The reason behind the disease state lies in that when the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted on the maternal allele, there will be a double dose of Igf2 which promotes cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>By regulating DNA methylation the tumorous cells are being forced to act more like healthy cells. This by no means signifies that all the cancer cells will become healthy due to the treatment, but it does reduces the number of cells in the disease state without killing them. Eventually there will also be competition between the healthy cells and the tumour cells which have higher apoptotic rates than healthy cells during chemotherapeutic treatment. </p>
<p>There are sensitive periods during devolpment in which DNA is methylated and demethylated, this is known as epigenetic reprogramming. These periods occur during pre-implantation and primoridial cell growth. Due to reprogramming during these periods, drugs that regulate DNA methylation should not be administered to either pregnant women or those attempting to conceive.</p></div>
