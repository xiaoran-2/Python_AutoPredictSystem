    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally kept free of methylation. In cancer cells, promotor CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, causing silencing of the associated gene. This disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands in cancer contributes to disease by silencing tumor suppressor genes (which may control the cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair).</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA methylation normally serves to control gene expression in these regions, assuring the proper regulation of gene expression and stable gene silencing. However, in cancer, there is global hypomethylation at intergenic and repetitive regions. Such disruption of DNA methylation in these regions contributes to cancer by causing genomic increased transcription which leads to genomic instability. Rearrangements can occur due illegitimate recombination between repeats, there can be activation of repeats and transposition, and activation of cryptic promotors and disruption to neighboring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer, there can be locus specific DNA hypermethylation at imprinting control regions, leading to loss of imprinting, which can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes. One such example is the H19/Igf2 gene cluster. Normally, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. On the unmethylated maternal allele, CTCF binds to the ICR and acts as an insulator. In this case, enhancers act on H19 (yielding expression of H19), but there is no expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele due to the insulator. On the methylated paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind, allowing the enhancers to act on Igf2 but not on the methylated H19. In Wilm’s tumor, there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele as well, resulting in expression of Igf2 on the maternal allele as well (so, you have a double dose of Igf2). Because Igf2 is a growth promotor, you get tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It decreases DNA methylation (so, it causes hypomethylation) by inhibiting DNA methyltransferate. It can have an anti-tumor effect because it incorporates into actively replicating DNA and reactivaties epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects because DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations. However, there are sensitive periods of development where reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs - during gametogenesis, after fertilization, or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because they may have unwanted and potentially catastrophic effects on methylation patterns that are necessary for normal development and survival.</p></div>
