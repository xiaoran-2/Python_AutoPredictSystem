    <div class="field-value"><p>One of the most studied epigenetic modifications is the covalent addition of a methyl group (CH3) to the 5’ position of a cytosine that precedes a guanosine in the DNA sequence (CpG dinucleotide). Promoter regions of genes contain rich regions of CpG dinucleotides, these regions are called CpG islands. Usually CpG islands in the promoter regions are unmethylated under physiological conditions which allows that the genes that contain the CpG islands can be transcribed in the presence of the required transcriptional activators. Additionally, there are regions where CpG islands are normally methylated in the genome, which is essential for embryonic development. It maintains differential expression of the maternal and paternal copies of genes that are subjected to parental imprinting and for stable silencing of genes on the inactive x-chromosome in females.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the mechanisms by which promoter CpG island methylation leads to gene silencing involve changes in the modification of profile of histones. Methylations at critical sites inhibits the binding of the transcriptional factors to their recognition elements by recruiting histone-modification enzymes by DNMTs and other nuclear factors such as methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins, which induce histone modifications that result in chromatin silencing. (Hendrich and Bird, 1998; Ballestar et al. 2005).</p>
<p>Cancer cells have the characteristic of having CpG-island hypermetilated, which causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes. These type of aberrant methylation appears to occur early in tumor development and increases progressively, leading to the malignant phenotype. Studies have shown that REs play a role in in the maintenance of nuclear architecture and organization of heterochromatine domains. (Espada et al. 2004), regulation of gene transcription, embryonic development and differenciation.  Hypomethylation of repetitive DNA elements is a common epigenetics event in cancer, because it is belived that these events impact chromosomal and transcriptional stability in the genome.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>H19</em> is transcribed only from the maternal allele, whereas <em>Igf2</em> expression is exclusively paternal. The <em>H19/Igf2</em> locus is a well-characterized cluster. Both genes share a common set of enhancers located downstream from the <em>H19</em> gene. The ICR, located 2 kb upstream of the <em>H19 </em>promoter, controls the monoallelic expression of the <em>H19</em> and <em>Igf2</em> genes by insulating communication between the 3′ enhancers and the <em>Igf2</em> promoter. The chromatin insulator property of the <em>H19</em>/<em>Igf2</em> ICR is regulated by a chromatin insulator protein, CTCF (for CCTC-binding factor), which binds only the non-methylated maternal allele. On the non-methylated maternal allele, binding of CTCF blocks the access of <em>Igf2</em> promoter to the enhancers, which consequently can only activate the <em>H19</em> promoter. On the paternal allele, the methylated <em>H19</em> does not bind to CTCF, allowing expression of <em>Igf2</em>.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilms Tumor, where the ICR region is hypermethylated which leads to loss of <em>H19</em> gene activity, therefore the activity of <em>Igf2</em> increases. <em>H19</em> gene activity, normally restrains growth, and when <em>Igf2</em> gene activity increases (which promotes growth),  together they lead to overgrowth. An increase amount of <em>Igf2</em> may stimulate the growth of tumor cells and prevent malign cell to be destroyed.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant methylation of CGIs in or near the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes (TSG) represents one of the most consistent hallmarks of human cancers and these TSGs are often silenced in haematopoietic malignancies. Thus, CGI methylation represents an ideal candidate for diagnostic and prognostic cancer markers.</p>
<p>Decitabine (DAC) is now recognised as an effective therapy for patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) due to its ability to inhibit DNA methylation when is administrated at low doses, even though their application for oncological diseases is restricted by their relative toxicity and poor chemical stability. Decitabine (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) is a demethylating agent that functions as a cytosine analogue. Upon undergoing phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase, it is incorporated into DNA and is believed to induce cell death via several mechanisms, including obstruction of DNA synthesis, induction of DNA structural instability, and degradation of DNMT. Decitabine has also been shown to induce differentiation of myeloblastic leukemic cells. (A. Ganetsky, 2012)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are sensitive periods of development where epigenetic modifications are influenced. During embryonic development in mammalian species, the primordial germ cells migrate to the developing gonad. Consequently, the germ cells develop into a male or female germline. Then, the female germline develops, entering into meiosis. The male germline continues to proliferate before birth, and then continues proliferation after birth. In the adult, the female germline undergoes oogenesis, to generate oocytes. The male germ-line develops and requires spermatogenesis for the production of spermatozoa.</p>
<p>During epigenetic programming of the germline, the migrating primordial germ cells undergo demethylation of the DNA. Then, when gonadal development and sex determination is initiated, the primordial germ cells develop female or male-germ-cell lineage and remethylate the DNA in a male or female specific manner. Therefore, the germ-cell DNA is demethylated and remethylated during gonadal sex determination, and appears sensitive to environmental factors. This early developmental period is the most sensitive to environmental insults influencing the epigenome. For example, treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because when a female is exposed to a chemical during gestation, this female provides direct exposure of the F0 generation female, the F1 generation embryo, and the germline that will generate the F2 generation is also directly exposed. </p></div>
