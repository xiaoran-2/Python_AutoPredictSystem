    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Methylation at CpG islands in the promoter region of genes leads to downregulation of gene expression. This kind of epigenetic mark is not frequent in normal cells. In cancer, however, there is an usual hypermethylation of CpG islands (and shores) in many genes, which may also include tumour suppressor genes. Therefore, the downregulation of those genes (tumour suppressors), together with the overall unbalance in gene expression, promote the growth of tumours.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In normal cell, DNA methylation is commonly found at intergenic regions, transposable elements and repetitive elements. This increases genomic stability by preventing 1) illegitimate DNA recombination; 2) disruption of genes by insertion of transposable elements; and 3) upregulation of nearby genes by active transposon promoters.</span> In cancer there a genome-wide hypomethylation, leading to genomic instability. These instabilities may cause deleterious mutations or downregulation of tumour supressor genes and/or favourable mutations or upregulation of oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>In the paternal allele, methylation of ICR prevents the insulator protein CTCF from binding. The enhancers can act on their prefered target, which is Igf2. ICR methylation also spreads to the start of H19, which is then not expressed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the maternal allele, there is no methylation of the ICR. The insulator protein binds to the ICR and prevents the enhancer from acting on Igf2. In turn, the enhancer promotes the expression of H19.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilm’s tumour, hypermethylation of ICR makes the maternal allele behave as the paternal one, giving rise to increased levels of Igf2. As Igf2 is a growth promoter, it becomes an oncogene.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine is a DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitor. This drug is an analog of the nitrogenated bases that make the DNA, and is incorporated in the DNA strand during replication. When the DNMT1 comes in to copy the epigenetic marks to the new strand, the protein binds irreversibly to the Decitabine and becomes non-functional.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Ths drug have an impact on cancer cells that are dependent of DNA hypermethylation, exactly because it disrupts the DNA methylation mechanism. Also, cancer cells divide rapidly, which is essencial to the mode of action of this and other DNA-methyl-transferase inhibitors.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation is meiotically heritable, meaning that this epigenetic mark (or lack thereof) will be passed from the treated cells to the daughter cells, granddaughter cells and so on, even after the tratment with the drug stops.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being erased and restablished (reset) during normal development. In humans, it is during early embrionic development and also during differentiation of pluripotent cells into the gametes. Treating people during the sensitive periods can affect the epigenetic machinery in normal cells, which could bring about several diseases, some of which have been presented in this course.</p></div>
