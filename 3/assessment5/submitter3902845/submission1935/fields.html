    <div class="field-value"><p>As seen before, in genomic DNA in normal cells, CpG islands can be found hypomethylated so it’s more likely to find methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements, hence regulation of gene expression. CpG islands are found often at the promoters; in normal circumstances a small subset of CpG islands are methylated between different cell types; this helps to maintain tissue stability. In addition, intergenic regions help to conserve genomic stability when they are methylated, while CpG islands remain unmethylated. When intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated they are most likely to become silent, this prevents aberrant expression of  transposable elements and transcriptional interference from strong promoters so illegitimate recombinations can’t occur.</p>
<p>Contrary to normal cell, in cancer cells CpG islands can be found hypermethylated so intergenic regions and repetitive elements are found unmethylated. This event leads to genomic instability. In cancer, since there is no genomic stability intergenic regions and repetitive elements are indiscriminately expressed leading to the over expression of transposable elements, or expression of other mutations such as deletions and insertions, therefore this can enhance instability on events like cryptic promoter activation or disruption of neighboring genes.</p>
<p>Additionally, uncontrolled methylation at CpG islands presents several features such as the development of tumor due to hypermethylation at CpG islands, since these cells have no genomic stability they can’t be well differentiated in tissues, so they grow and proliferate in disorder creating tumors. In addition, phenomenon such as tumor suppression hypermethylation, leads to low expression of tumor suppressing proteins and subsequently a defective regulation of cell proliferation, leading to neoplasia and invasion. Also, since DNA methylation is mitotically hereditable it progresses with time, the same event occurs when DNA methylation is disrupted at CpG islands.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes can be controlled by Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). In cancer cells, disruption of imprinting means loss of imprinting, which means that either the same gene is expressed from both parental alleles o silent from both parental alleles. That’s because either hypomethylation or hypermethylation can occur. In case of H19/Igf2, both paternal and maternal alleles have a CTCF site, an insulator element that insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. In the maternal allele CTCF site is unmethylated, so the insulator can bind to this site leading the enhancers to act on H19, so the Igf2 on the maternal allele will become silent. On the other hand, in the paternal allele CTCF site is methylated so the insulator doesn’t bind, hence, the enhancers act on Igf2 while H19 remains silent. In cancer cells there is loss of imprinting; in case of H19/Igf2 both paternal and maternal allele can be hypermethylated; both alleles express Igf2, and in both alleles H19 is silent, leading to an over expression of this growth factor associated with Wilm’s tumor, a kidney tumor that can occur in early development or infants, but it’s less likely to occur in adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a precursor of acute myelogenous leukemia. Decitibine is an enzymatic inhibitor, it inhibits DNMTs; it incorporates to DNA upon duplication, so when DNMTs goes to DNA to methylate it, decitabine binds to the DNMT, causing an irreversible bond; the action of this inhibitors is believed to be dependent on DNA replication. Although, decitabine is not very specific, it can kill normal or cancer cells. The reason why decitabine is used is because cancer cells divide more rapidly so they can be affected in higher scale than normal cells, since the latter don’t divide at the same rate, therefore they inhibit neoplastic effect by killing cancer cells faster, consequently, they have antitumor effect. It’s believed that decitabine demethylates CpG islands, so specific repression at certain regions may be removed enabling activation of certain genes, for instance apoptotic genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Maybe epigenetic treatments can help standard chemotherapy, for instance DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so by altering DNA methylation in a population of cells, the daughter cells may be affected as well, for example, since DMNT1 recognize hemi-methylated cells if a daughter cell lacks of methylation DMNT1 can’t act in following generations; this way epigenomic effect can last longer even when standard chemotherapy is used. Although, it wouldn’t be advisable to treat patients during sensitive periods; these periods occur during pre-implantation development and germ cell development. In these periods particular epigenetic marks are removed in order to give the cell totipotency or pluripotency during epigenetic reprograming.</p>
<p>It’s not advisable to treat patients during these periods because much of DNA methylation is removed specifically from paternal and maternal DNA methylation, leaving imprinted genes and IAPs highly methylated; if the epigenetic state is altered at these periods, imprinted genes and repeats would be most likely to be demethylated leading to effects such as illegitimate recombinations, activation of neighboring genes, expression of transposable elements and other mutations, causing genomic instability and enhancing neoplasia, thus, this will increase the proliferation of cancer cells.</p></div>
