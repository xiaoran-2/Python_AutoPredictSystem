    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands normaly act regulating the gene expression, most commonly by decreasing it. Also, the presence of those islands, multifactorialy, increases the incurrence of mutations that aim to disrupt a possible increase in the copies of repetitive elements. Furthermore, when a new DNA strand is being formed during replication  they may help in the repair of an error by identifying which is  the template. Also since being involved in the formation of h<span style="font-size:14px;">eterochromatin it acts protecting against the expression of viral genomic sequences. Intragenic and repetitive elements DNA methylation <span>decreases the binding of RNA Polymerase and thus lowers transcription of the previously reffered to as "junk" DNA. It is, additionally, involved in directing correct RNA splicing and in regulation of replication. Also it acts protecting against the expression of viral genomic sequences integrated in those regions.     </span></span></p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands located in/near the promoter region tend to be hypermethylated and this in turn contributes to the silencing of the relevant gene, which can play a role on control of the cell cycle, cell survival and differentiation, such as tumor-supressors or it may cause microsatellite instability (directed hypomethylation), lower mutations rate and deregulation of lncRNAs since across the genome, methylation decreases. Those changes lead to uncontrollable cell proliferation and unexpected resistance to cell death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the imprint control region of the cluster is methylated and so the enhancers contribute to the increase of <em>Igf2</em> gene expression, which is their normal role, while the <em>H19</em> being methylated is respressed.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the imprint control region is not methylated allowing the binding of CTCF insulator protein which blocks the enhancers from accessing the <em>Igf2</em> gene while they act towards increasing the expression of <em>H19</em> gene. </p>
<p><span>In Wilm's tumor, there is<span> <span>hypermethylation of CTCF binding sites (imprint control region) that results in increasing the expession</span></span> of <em>Igf2 </em>gene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Since Igf2 acts growth-regulating, insulin-like and controls mitogenic activities, its increase of expression induces abnormal mitotic rate; cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is cytidine analog acting as a hypomethylating factor because it inhibits DNA methytransferase (which role is the transfer of methyl groups to DNA) when being incorporated in the forming of the new DNA strand during replication. <span style="font-size:14px;">It may also allow the restoring of normal genes expression state that enables the cell to control the cellular differentiation and proliferation. Also, </span><span style="font-size:14px;">due to the formation of covalent adducts between itself and DNA methytransferase incorporated in the strand it leads</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> to cellular differentiation or apoptosis.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs are nucleoside analogs <span style="font-size:14px;">causing hypomethylation of DNA since they inhibit DNA methyltransferase and direct cytotoxicity to rapidly replicating cells. </span><span style="font-size:14px;">Hypomethylation may restore normal </span><span style="font-size:14px;">genes expression state that is important for differentiation and proliferation.</span></p>
<p>Sensitive periods of development are early pregnancy, infantile and childhood periods. Even if most body structures are developed before delivery, the central nervous system isn't fully developed before the age of 20 years.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">So, </span><span style="font-size:14px;">toxicity for the embryo may result in death or developmental abnormalities. Also </span><span style="font-size:14px;">It is not known whether these drugs are secreted in milk when breastfeeding mothers are under treatment, so lactation period could also be categorised as being sensitive period. Another </span><span style="font-size:14px;">concern is mutagenesis and the rise of tumors/cancer.</span></p></div>
