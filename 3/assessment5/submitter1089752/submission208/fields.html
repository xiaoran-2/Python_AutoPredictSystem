    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are significantly altered by cancer. In normal cells, promoters at CpG islands are generally free of methylation. Being free of methylation, these promoters  will again be generally associated with gene expression.  In cancer, the CpG islands are often hypermethylated. This hypermethylation then inhibits gene expression. This obviously contributes significantly to the virulence of a given cancer when, for example, the genes being silenced are tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements in normal cells are generally methylated. In cancer those same intergenic regions and repetitive elements end up hypomethylated. This hypomethylation creates genomic instability by allowing for illegitimate recombinations, transpositions, and even activation of some promoters and thus adds to the virulence of the cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, cancer seems to involve a generalized alteration of methylation patters where normally unmethylated CpG islands become hypermethylated and normally methylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements become hypomethylated. These changes seem to be progressive as at least certain tumors evolve. And that allows these markers to be used for both diagnostic purposes and to provide targets of possible pharmacological intervention. Further, these same markers can be used prognostically in identifying highly progressed or highly aggressive cancers.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by disrupting the balance of gene expression. In the case of imprinted genes, expression would be silenced on one allele in a normal cell. For example, the paternal allele in a normal cell would be methylated so that H19 is NOT expressed. This allows the enhancers to activate the expression of Igf2. On the maternal allele where H19 IS expressed the enhancers are not able to activate Igf2 expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor both the paternal and material alleles have the methylation pattern seen in the paternal allele of a normal cell. That is, both alleles have a silencing of H19 and expression of Igf2. This double dose of Igf2 contributes to the cancer insofar as Igf2 is a growth promoter.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a new DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). By inhibiting methyltransferase activity, Decitabine produces hypomethylation. The aim of this hypomethylation in treating cancer is to undo the hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes that has evolved with the cancer and to thus free those tumor suppressors to play their role as suppressors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ability to pharmacologically alter DNA methylation can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, DNA methylation patterns can be passed through cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. This allows for an enduring effect of an epigenetic drug beyond its own molecular half-life. That said, there are certain sensitive periods—notably during germ cell gametogenesis and during early fetal development –in which cells are going through a thorough epigenetic reprogramming. The epigenetic interference during those periods with an extraneous epigenetic agent could have significant unintended consequences. A methylating agent could defeat the removal of marks that is a necessary part of the imprinting process. Or, a demythelating/hypomethylating agent could conversely inadvertently defeat the resetting of epigenetic marks leading to unintended gene activation and expression. </p></div>
