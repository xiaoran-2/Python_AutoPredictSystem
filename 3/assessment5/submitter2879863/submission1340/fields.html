    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation in CpG islands is associated with a number of key processes including x chromosome inactivation, supression of repetitive elements, genomic imprinting, <span>the formation of heterochromatin, </span>etc. In cancer the cpG islands may be hypermethylated and can silence tumor suppressor genes that can help to generate been one of the hits in Knudson hypothesis that in the future can form an hyperplasia and later a cancer. intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain the DNA stability,<span> repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing</span>,  DNA methylation is less than normal cells in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (hypomethylated) that generates genomic inestability and generate cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Decitabine is a hypomethylated agent.</span><span> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting Dna methyltransferases</span><span>. D<span>ecitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands. Decitabine exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing DNA hypomethylation and cell differentiation or apoptosis. </span></span>DNA-demethylating agents <span>are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This two genes reacts in opossite way to the state of methylation in the ICR between this two genesin the paternal allele the Igf2 is active while H19 is inactive because the methylation in ICR, in the matern allele the Igf2 is inactive while H19 is active because is not methylated. in wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal ICR are methylated, this promotes and overexpression of Igf2 thats can generate a tumor  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to the genes that are critical to the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. other mechanism is that </span>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are erased and dont return. the sensitive periods is <span>a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms, there are two </span>primordial germ cell development and early development when cell is reprograming. Epigenetic therapies in sensitive periods can effect changes that can change development of the cell, inactivating or overexpressing genes generating other diseases. </p>
