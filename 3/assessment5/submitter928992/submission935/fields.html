    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark and it is part of the epigenetic machinery.</span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">It is a process of addition of methyl group to a cytosine in a cytosine – guanine couple (CpG).</span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">Generally a high percentage of all CpGs  in mammals (60-70%) are methylated. Some gathered in regions with high abundance  – called CpG islands.</span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">Often, within the CpG islands are located promoters of gene expression, and thus by methylating them, the genes under their regulation are silenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">During the development the cells of the embryo undergo  epigenetic reprogramming.</span></span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">This means, that DNA methylation is removed and reestablished again both for maternal and paternal alleles of the genes. Throughout the genome though, there are repeating sequences (repeats)- mutliple copies of a specific DNA sequence in the genome, often established by the insertion of transposons, which are kept highly methylated trough the whole epigenetic reprogramming process and during the lifespan of the cell.</span></span></span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">A possible explanation is, that by silencing them, the cell tries to avoid the over expression of  certain genes, present in the repeats and thus to escape abnormal transformations.                       </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">Throughout the genome of a normal cell the DNA methylation of the CpG islands is lower, compared to that in cancer cells. This is a way of the malignant cell, to escape its faith, by silencing for example genes like tumor suppressor genes, which will inhibit it.</span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">In contrast, DNA methylation in the repeats is highly decreased in cancer cells, compared to normal ones.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><address> <span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">Genomic imprinting is the process of  silencing of one of the alleles of a certain gene and </span><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">The H19/ Igf2 cluster is example for it.  Upstream from the H19 gene, there is a ICR sequence (Imprint Control Reagen) to which CTCF binds  to promote  enhancers and thus H19 is expressed.  In the presence of methylation on that ICR region, no ICR – CTCF complex is established and the enhancers act on another gene – Igf2, which is located upstream from the ICR region, but the H19  is not expressed. The  ICR-CTCF formation prevents enhancer´s preferential distant action, and  makes them more prone to act closely. In the cell, there is a paternal imprint of this locus,in which ICR is higly methylated, which leads to the expression of Igf2 . On the maternal alele, there is no imprint on the ICR and H19 is preferentialy influenced by the enhancers.</span></address><address><span style="font-size:medium;font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:#000000;">Imrpinting is established during the primordial germ cells development, and imrpoper imprint leads to different disorders. In  h19/Igf2, the hypermethylation leads to unipaternal disomy, the tumor supressor gene - H19 is underexpressed  and Wilmś tumor are developed. Imrpint disorders are also conected with loss of methylation, where Igf2 growth factor is underexpressed.</span></address>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is a FDA approved DNA methylatransferase inhibitor (DNMT1i). Normally DNMT1 sustains the DNA methylation throughout cell division , using as a substrate hemi-methylated DNA chains. The usage of Decitabine leads to loss of DNA methylation over time, which can be extremely favorable in the case of curtain tumors as <span style="color:#4a4a4a;"><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;">myelodysplastic syndromes, the latter progresses to acute myeloplastic leukemia. By blocking DNA methylation through Decitabine, that particular type of cancer is suppressed.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Changing DNA methylation with drugs, might reveal short term and long term </span>achievements in the war against cancer.Drugs, changing the epigenetic state are used not only by themselves in the cases of leukemias and lymphomas but also in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs for better results even in solid tumors, which are hard to reach.  In some cases, after the epigenetic drug is stopped, there is still an ongoing effect, which might be the explanation for the better influence from chemotherapy.</p>
<p><span>Generally, the establishment of the epigenetic marks is considered a sensitive period –</span>from early embryonic development to the development of the primordial germ cells and their maturation afterwards. So treating patients with promoters or inhibitors of the epigenetic state during this period might have terrible effect for the individual.</p>
<p><span>Once the epigenetic marks are established, they are only maintained trough the cell </span>divisions. Thus, if the epigenetic state is changed, trough some drugs, the new state will be sustained trough cell division and this might be an easy way to overcome the necessities of changing the genetic information in fight with cancer.</p>
