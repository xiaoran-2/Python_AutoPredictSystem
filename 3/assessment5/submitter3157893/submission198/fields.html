    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are normally unmethylated regardless of thie activity state. They are mostly promoters that encourage some gene expression. In cancer cells, these CpG islands are hypermethylated. The hypermethylation of the CpG islands suppresses their promoter activity. They are not able to promote the tumor suppresser genes. So the tumor suppression genes are not expressed. This epigenetic aberration causes tumors to grow without any suppression leading to cancer. In normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated. Methylation silences their transcription to preserve genomic integrity and avoid confusion. In cancer cells these intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated and so are not silenced. This excessive expression of usually silenced genes causes confusion by allowing deletions, duplication and interchange of genetic information during transcription.  These epigenitic changes cause disease by allowing aberrant gene expressions in cells. As a result of aberrant gene expressions the cells become abnormal. These abnormal cells form cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the group of DNA-demethylating agents (DNMTI- DNA Methyl transfer interferase). This drug interferes with methylation and reduces methylation in the genes. Generally in cancer cells it has been observed that CpG islands are hyper methylated leading to silencing of tumor suppresser genes. These tumor suppresser genes that are silenced by methlation in cancer cells are demethylated using decitabine, thus allowing their expression. So gradually the tumor is suppressed. Thus decitabine has an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has a genome wide effect. When it is altered, the epigenetic marks are changed affecting gene expression.  Methylation silences the gene expression and demethylation allows gene expression. These epigenetic changes are passed on to the succesive cells during cell division.  Then the former epigenetic marks are completely erased. This change is permanent and does not come back. So treatments that alter epigenetic should not be given during sensitive periods. These are periods when the epigenetic marks are completely erased and reestablished.  This happens during gametogenisis and after fertilization in embryonic stem cell stage. It is not advisable to treat patients at this stage as there can be permanent ill effects due to epigenetic changes in the offspring in next-generation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19  is methylated in the paternal allele disrupting the CTCF binding to form chromatin barrier and so transcription of lgf2 is stimulated into its expression. But in the maternal allele H19 is not methylated so it binds CTCF forming a chromatin barrier that prevents the transcription of lgf2.  This methylation pattern is parentally imprinted to form parent specific mono-allelic gene expression. In Wilm's tumor cancerous tumor is formed in the kidney.  This is due to the loss of imprinting  of the H19/lgf2 cluster.   Instead of the expression of just the paternal lgf2 the maternal lgf2 is also expressed leading to excessive growth factor (Igf2) that leads to the development of tumor cells which have stimulated growth and decreased destruction of damaged cells.</p></div>
