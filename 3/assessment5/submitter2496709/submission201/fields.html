    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is normally found in intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and gene introns, usually silencing genes nearby(as in X-chromosome inactivation) and promoting genome stability. DNA methylation is not normally found in CpG islands. But in cancer, the reverse is true. Methylated CpG islands tend to be found in front of tumor supressor genes. These genes are then silenced.Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, these marks are easily spread, creating a mass of cells with this abnormal methylation. Cells without normally functioning tumor supressor genes outcompete normal cells, increasing the likelihood of tumor growth. Different tumor types will have a specific set of genes with hypermethylated CpG islands. These different CpG island methlyation patterns can indicate disease prognoses and responses to therapy.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions, introns, and most commonly repetitive elements tend to be hypomethylated in cancer. Since the repetitive elements lack normal methylation, the DNA is more open for inappropriate recombination.The opening of the repetitive elements also leaves them able to replicate and jump around the genome. These elements can insert themselves randomly, disrupting genes or regulatory regions. Hypomethylation of ingegenic regions in cancer, while not as common as that in repetitive elements, can cause activation of genes that should otherwise be silent. For example, activation of CpG poor promoters can cause activation of microRNAs that, in turn, silence tumor supressors. This allows for cells to grow out of control. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions are often disrutpted in cancer. Both alleles can either be activated together or silenced together. The H19/lgf2 cluster is a good example. Normally the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing for CTCF(an insulator) to bind, and enahancers to activate H19 and NOT lgf2. The paternal allele is normally methylated, preventing CTCF to bind. The enhancers can then access and activate lgf2. In this way, the dosage of lgf2, a growth factor, is regulated.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is hypermethylated causing it to behave like the paternal allele. The cell therefore has twice the normal dose of the lgf2 growth factor. Imprinting disruptions are often early events in cancer, setting up the abnormal dosage of growth factors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA de-methylating agent. This drug is a nucleoside analouge, incorporating itself into the DNA where a DNA Methyltransferase enzyme(DNMT) can then irreversibly bind to it. This binding locks up the DNMT and it can no longer methylate DNA. Since the drug is incorporated into the DNA, this method only works on replicating cells. Tumor cells divide rapidly, incorporating more decitabine into their DNA. Thus, the epigenetic marks can be removed from tumor cells. This type of drug would only be useful in cases where the genome is over methylated. Since epigenetic marks are often found in layers with other corresponding marks, a more potent treatment could be to combine decitabine with drugs that remove other abnormal marks as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Scientists are hesitant to use DNA methylation altering drugs because the drugs are taken systemically and affect all cell types, not just tumors. In normal developement, these epigenetic marks are laid down to estabilish proper regulatory networks of genes. The most crucial times for this are in the developing embryo(when most marks are cleared and reprogrammed), germ cell lines(another reprogramming of marks to distinguish genes from paternal or maternal origin), and in cell differentiation. These periods of clearing and re-establishing marks are known as "sensitive periods". Treating patients during these times could lead to abnormal epigenome, which could in turn lead to disease. An example would be Wilm's tumor, where the maternal allele is improperly methylated, causing it to behave as the paternal allele and throwing the dosage of growth factors out of balance.</p></div>
