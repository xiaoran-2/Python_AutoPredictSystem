    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG island is found in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes. In a normal cell the CpG island is hypomethylated, while in the cancer cell, the CpG island is hypermethylated, thus the tumor suppressor genes  are silenced.   The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated in the normal cell, while in the cancer cell the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The patternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can’t bind at this region. And if CTCF isn't binding and there is no insulator action then these enhancers are indeed free to act on Igf2, so Igf2 is expressed on <br /> paternal allele. When the imprint control region is unmethylated in maternal allele it is binding by protein called CTCF, that is an insulator protein, that is able to insulate Igf2.So now the enhancers are free to act on H19 and the Igf2 it’s not expressed. In Wilm’s tumour happens the loss of imprinting and  overexpression of growth promoting genes  or loss of those geno suppress genes because of the loss of imprinting. That aberrant expression of  imprinted genes can result in specific diseases. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine belongs to the class of  DNA-demethylating agentens and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. The  Decitabine acts as an inhibitor of DNA-methyltransferases that appears to be responsible for maintenance of established patterns of methylated DNA, The mechanisms are partially mediated by the hypomethylation of DNA with cytotoxic effects documented at higher concentrations .The  act modulating  genes involved in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cytostasis, differentiation and tumor angiogenesis. They get incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then, when the DNA methyltransferase comes along to bind it, the DNMT1 comes along to bind that  nucleotide to then copy the methylation  to the daughter strand, that DNA methyltransferase is bound irreversibly  and it can no longer be released. So this means that cancer cells which are  dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation can  be enduring effects, especially if occurs on the sensitive period  . A sensitive period is a period when epigenetic marks are actively remodeled, like early development and primordial germ cell development. Because of that,  taking this kind of drugs in this period  would be dangerous therefore the cell can lose the epigenetic machinery and the cell may no longer be able to have these epigenetic marks.</p></div>
