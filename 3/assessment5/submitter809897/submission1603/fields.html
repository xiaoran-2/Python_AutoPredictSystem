    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine (DAC) (2’-deoxy-5-azacytidine, Dacogen®; Eisai Inc., Woodcliff Lake,NJ) is used clinically for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of bone marrow stem cell disorders.</p>
<p> <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DAC are cytidine nucleoside analogs that become incorporated into newly synthesized DNA,where they bind DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in an irreversible, covalent manner. The sequestration of DNMTs prevents maintenance of the methylation state of DNA, leading to DNA hypomethylation.</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">As a consequence, genes previously silenced by DNA hypermethylation can be re-expressed upon treating cancer cell lines with these DNMT inhibitors. Re-expression of aberrantly methylated genes involved in normal cell cycle control, differentiation, and apoptotic pathways is believed to contribute to the anticancer effects of these drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DAC modulates expression of different sets of genes. Although both AZA and DAC caused DNMT1 depletion and DNA hypomethylation in NSCLC cell lines, the drugs had very different effects on cell viability, DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell cycle.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Altering DNA methylation can have enduring factors since once the factor is erased it will not return. Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells enduring effects on the epigenome.</span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, JQ1, inhibits an epigenetic regulator called BRD4, blocking the activity of a gene by the name of </span><em class="Italic">Myc</em><span>. </span><em class="Italic">Myc</em><span> encodes a protein called a transcription factor that is another part of the DNA-regulation system. This particular transcription factor is involved in the expression of about 15% of human genes. When it goes wrong it is one of the most common causes of cancer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>During sensitive periods, the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms</span> of genetic imprinting of DNA methylation, chromatin conformational changes through histone modifications, ncRNAs and, most recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine being expressed during meiosis, and embriogenesis, are critical in proper development of gene expression.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Experiments in rodents show that experiences during sensitive periods of development influence DNA methylation patterns of several genes. These experience-induced DNA methylation patterns represent stable epigenetic modifications that alter gene transcription throughout the lifespan and promote specific behavioral outcomes. Treating patients during sensitive periods may have adverse effects in the genomic imprint. </span></span></span></span></p></div>
