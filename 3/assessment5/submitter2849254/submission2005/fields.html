    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation in Cancer basically includes the hypermethylation of CpG islands and the hypomethylation of repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions.</p>
<p>          In normal cells, DNA methylation plays an important role in maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring proper, balanced and timely gene expression patterns during differents growth and developmental stages.  Indeed,  many genes involved in cell growth are kept silent through the methylation of their promoter regions, and that methylation might be reversed when the particular gene expression is needed. however, CpG- rich promoters are often exempted from such methylation. Hypermethylation of repetitive elements is also a common feature of normal cells, preventing these elements from randomly inserting many copies of themselves throughout the genome, thus from creating mutations that might lead to inactivation of tumor suppressors or activation of oncogenes. Methylation of  intergenic regions also serves to silencing cryptic transcription start sites in the intergenic region, thus to the maintainance of genomic integrity.  </p>
<p>          Meanwhile, in cancer cells, general DNA hypomethylation is observed alongside with CpG island hypermethylation. Indeed, many of the  genes containing high proportion of CpG islands are tumor suppressor genes such as Retinoblastoma. Therefore, hypermethylation of the CpG islands on these promoters and their shores might lead to gene silencing and to subsequent impairement of the cell ability to deal with oncogene activation or oncogene-induced DNA damage, resulting in cancer onset, development and progression. On the other hand,  hypomethylation of intergenic  region might lead to the activation of cryptic transcription start sites, resulting in genomic instability, meanwhile hypomethylation of repetitive elements might result in illegitimate recombination, inactivation of tumor suppressor gene expression, and activation of oncogenes, which might all lead to tumorigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>            One of the common features of cancer cells is their overwhelming growth capacity,  suggesting that  cancer cells might develop and/or favour  cell growth promoting mechanisms and impair growth restricting ones. One way of achieving this is by modulating the expression of imprinted genes which are in their large majority involved in cell growth processes. This is illustrated with the hypermethylation of the imprinting control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster, leading to the overexpression of the growth promoting factor Igf2 in the Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>           Indeed, in normal cells, the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and  consequently, the Igf2 gene is only expressed  from that very paternal allele as ICR imprinting allows the enhancers to activate Igf2 expression only on that same allele while the maternal allele is kept silent due to the enhancers preferentially binding to the insulator CTCF and therefore triggering the expression of the downstream H19 gene to the detriment of the Igf2 gene.</p>
<p>          In the Wilm's tumor however, hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele results in the expression of the Igf2 from the maternal allele. as a consequence, there is a double ammount of Igf2 produced resulting in an excessive growth  that cause kidney failure in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylation agent and such, might be useful against tumor types arising from DNA hypermethylation by  histone methyltransferases such as the Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2). Indeed, hypermethylation of CpG islands on Tumor suppressors genes  promoters such as Rb and CDKN2a, may result in the silencing of the expression of the latters, which may in turn impair the ability of the cell to repair the insults inflicted to the DNA by both oncogenes and the environment.  By triggering the demethylation of CpG islands on Tumor suppressor genes, Decitabime may help restoring the balance between methylation and demethylation, which is crutial to the normal growth of the cell</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are mitotically  inheritable , and this might explain why drug-induced epigenetic alterations might be long lasting, compared to genetic alteration. however , care should be taken to avoiding treating  patients during developmental sensitive periods.  indeed, during sensitive periods of development ( pre-implantation cell development period and primordial germ cell development period) there is a global reprogramming of epigenetic marks and DNA methylation marks are often erased and reset. Therefore, it would be useless to apply epigenetic treatment at theses development stages as they won't be effective.</p></div>
