    <div class="field-value"><p>In genetics, CpG islands or CG islands (CGI) are genomic regions that contain a high frequency of CpG sites. Methylation of CpG sites in the promoter of a gene may inhibit gene expression.  When a disease, such as cancer occurs, gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation/hypomethylation , which results in transcriptional silencing that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. Hypomethylation arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting. <br />DNA methylation, which usually serves as a mark of transcriptional downregulation, helps prevent deleterious consequences by preventing transcription from happening in places it has no business happening. Nonspecific transcription may still happen, but probably at a much lower rate than it would in a unmethylated case. In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and non-coding intergenic regions. Parasitic repetitive sequences, centromeres and oncogenes are often repressed through methylation. When disrupted by cancer, this repression is no longer active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7ac41a001899cac5d9fa588d/970238/asst-5/970238-52132be3a2d4c9.59322312.jpg" alt="" /><br />Imprinting, the differential expression of the two alleles of a gene based on their parental origin, requires that the alleles be distinguished or marked. A candidate for the differentiating mark is DNA methylation. The maternally expressed H19 gene is hypermethylated on the inactive paternal allele in somatic tissues and sperm, but to serve as the mark that designates the imprint, differential methylation must also be present in the gametes and the pre−implantation embryo.  The paternal−specific methylation of the far 5' region is the mark that distinguishes the two alleles of H19.<br />Wilms' tumor or nephroblastoma is cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults. In normal cells, the paternal IGF2 and maternal H19 genes are expressed. Several sites upstream of H19 are methylated on the paternal allele (filled circles) and unmethylated on the maternal allele (open circles). In tumors with LOI, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. LOI of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands.<br /><br />Decitabine's anticancer effects are believed to be twofold.   <br />One way that it works is by demethylation or interfering with the methylation of DNA.  By this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.<br />Decitabine also belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites.  Antimetabolites are very similar to normal substances within the cell.  When the cells incorporate these substances into the cellular metabolism, they interact with a number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation patterns cause abnormal expression of cancer-associated genes. The epigenetic changes can be used as biomarkers for the molecular diagnosis of early cancer.<br />Sensitive periods refers to important periods of childhood development,  during which the child is particularly sensitive to certain types of stimuli or interactions. During such a period, it is very easy for children to acquire certain abilities, such as language, discrimination of sensory stimuli, and mental modeling of the environment. <br />It is likely the case that in combination with DNA methylation modifications, a complex histone code is involved in mediating the long-term effects of early environmental influences. This aspect of early-experience induced epigenetic modification in the central nervous system.</p></div>
