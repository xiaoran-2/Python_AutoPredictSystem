    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene expression in the cell is controlled via different mechanisms. While all cells have the same DNA in general, different tissues have different expression of this DNA. One factor that effect this expression is a promoter region called CpG islands. In general, genes are not expressed when the islands next to them are methylated. Methylation of CpG island prevents protein from transcribing DNA into mRNA.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermythelated. Unlike normal cells, hypermethlation decrease the levels of proteins necessary to control the cell.</p>
<p>For example, P53 is a famous protein that fixes DNA damage. When its CpG island is methylated, the expression is inhibited and DNA damage happens more frequently. Genes that fix cell damage, control the apoptosis(cell death)and manage growth may be suppressed by CpG methylation and it may lead to uncontrolled growth and cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, over 98% of human genome is heavily methylated to prevent viral genes and unwanted errors from happening. Repetitive elements in DNA is error porn regions due to the possibility of chromosome instability because of them. When those elements lost their methyl signals, the result may be changes in karyotype or mutation that lead to activation of oncogenes or having several copies of growth proteins.</p>
<p>Many intergenic regions are responsible for non-coding RNA which have regulatory rule is cell function and growth. Those regions are methylated in general. Similarly to repetitive elements, they may lose their methylation and be activated. This unleashes uncontrolled growth and lose of function in the cell, a characteristic feature of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) from paternal origin is expressed, while the same gene is suppressed in maternal chromosome. The main reason is a control region of CpG repeats and a noncoding RNA called H19.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In maternal allele, CpG island is not methylated and H19 is expressed. A protein called CTCF joins to CpG island and prevents IGF-2 promoters. The sum of these actions is suppression of maternal IGF-2.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, paternal CpG island is methylated and IGF-2 is expressed freely, and H19 is not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If maternal IGF-2 allele is not repressed due to CpG methylation, the outcome is overexpression of the growth factor. This causes more than 50% of Wilms tumors. Methylation of CpG island on both alleles (both parents) will prevent CTCF from binding to CpG repeats and prevent H19 expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">Some cancers have hyper methylated regions such as the CpG islands. It leads to under expression of some genes (P53) and over expression of others (nclRNA). The enzyme involved in this procedure is called DNA methyltransferase (DNMT).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decitabine is DNA-demethylating agent,which means that it causes hypomethylating of DNA. Its mechanism of action is by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regaining normal CpG methylation statues is essential in tumor suppression. Mainly because proteins that control cell growth and health can restore their funtion.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr">After the initial imprinting in post implantation embryo, the epigenetic marks last for life. The only time it could be removed naturally is in germ-line again, and in reprogramming early embryo. These two periods are the only time that epigenetic markers can be modified easily, they are considered a sensitive time in epigenome formation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The great idea about epigenetic treatment is that there is no need to kill the cell, the cells can be cured. And the cure is permanent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The danger of this approach is using epigenetic during re-imprinting periods for people who get ready to have babies, and in early pregnancy (pre-implantation embryo). Those time that cells can be most venerable to epigenetic drugs. The change that can be caused is not controllable, and will affect the embryo for the rest of its life.</p></div>
