    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In non-cancerous cells, CpG islands are found in more than half of all promoters in the human genome. As a result, because these genes need to be expressed, the CpG islands are usually not methylated. However, in some cancers, the CpG islands can become methylated. This means that these genes may be switched off when they shouldn't be. When these genes are silenced, it means that the cell will not have the proteins or RNAs that are necessary to function. If the genes that are being silenced are tumor suppressing genes, it will result in tumors growing without the normal controls in cells that would prevent them. As a result, this CpG island hypermethylation leads to cancer phenotypes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells, and in cancer cells this methylation can be disrupted. As a result, the intergenic spaces and repetitive elements are not being silenced via methylation. This can result in new genes being turned on, or promoters for intergenic spaces that result in higher expression of genes that promote tumorigenesis. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alteratoins can have enduring effects on the epigenome beause methylation is mitotically inheritable. Therefore, daughter cells will still have the altered DNA methylation, which might not always be a good idea depending on what was methylated. There are several sensitive periods during development during which the epigenome is being altered by the environment around the organism. Some major sensitive periods are during the formation of gametes, at which point there is a clearing of methylation, during early development and implantation, and a few other times throughout the life of the organism. (For example, studies regarding the effects of good rat mothering involve rats that are beyond early implantation and gamete formation, but show that there are more sensitive periods during life.) Because sensitive periods include implantation and gamete formation, it would be inadvisable to treat patients during their sensitive period or the sensitive periods of their in utero children as this may disrupt the epigenome and affect the children for their entire lives.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Treating patients with Decitabine will result in DNA being demethylated, which should release some of the silencing effects of DNA hypermethylation. The way that Decitabine would be used to treat cancer is to demethylate DNA. Since the DNA hypermethylation centered on histones, it resulted in the silencing of the genes near histones. Some of these genes are tumor suppressor genes. By demethylating DNA, these genes can be turned back on, and will suppress tumors. This should result in fewer tumors and better cancer recovery.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by causing incorrect dosage of certain protein products. Some proteins should only be expressed by one allele, otherwise they result in disease phenotypes. In the paternal allele for H19/Igf2, there is DNA methylation at the imprint control region, which also spreads to the H19 promoter. This blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, which means that the downstream enhancers are able to access Igf2, causing it to be expressed. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region and H19 promoter are both unmethylated. As a result, CTCF is able to bind to the DNA and block the downstream enhancers so that they are unable to act on Igf2. Additionally, H19 will be expressed on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>When imprinting is disrupted at the H19/Igf2 cluster, it can result in disease by causing both alleles to act identically. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by the maternal allele acting like a paternal allele. As a result, there is an overdose of Igf2 and other related genes. This overgrowth results in uncontrolled cell growth and eventually can cause Wilm's tumor. In Wilm's tumor, the ICR is hypermethylated.</p>
