    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are usually hypomethylated, but in cancer cells, the CpG islands tend to be methylated. DNA methylation at the CpG islands can cause tumor suppressor genes to be silenced. Even regions surrounding the CpG isands, called the CpG island shores, tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. An accumulation of silencing of tumor suppressor genes, in addition to other hits to the DNA, contributes to the likelihood of getting cancer and diseases.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Methylating the integenic regions help to maintain the genomic integrity by preventing insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocation of the chromosomes. And methylating the repetitive elements prevents transposition of the genes and transcriptional interference. However, in cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypomethylated. The genome can become instable. Transposons jump around the genome and the chromosomes have some sort of alteration, such as addition, deletion, inversions, or translocation. These aberrations in the genome can lead to cancer and abnormal growth of the cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated at the maternal allele. Because the maternal ICR is unmethylated, CTFC is able to bind to it and insulate Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The enhancers will then only act on the H19 and Igf2 is kept silent. On the other hand, the paternal ICR is methylated. Therefore, the enhancers will act on Igf2, and Igf2 will be expressed in the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor, the maternal ICR is hypermethylated. The maternal allele begins to act like the paternal allele and expresses Igf2. Now, the dosage of Igf2 is doubled. The upregulation of Igf2, which is an oncogene, leads to overgrowth and other symptoms associated with  Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It helps to decrease DNA methylation in the cells. A lot of cancers are caused by mutations that make the enzymes overactive. This leads to more methylation of histones than there should be and may even silence the genes they surround, including tumor-suppressor genes, which prevent the uncontrolled cell growth that causes cancer. Therefore, by lowering the overmethylation of DNA, more tumor suppressor genes will be active and will keep the tumor from proliferating. Furthermore, DNMT are replication dependent. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, then cancer cells will be affected by the drug more. By using this drug in the correct dosage, it may help treat cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so the epigenetic changes get passed on during cell division to daughter cells. A sensitive period is when the epigenetic marks are actively reprogrammed. One such period is the time from primordial cell development. The other sensitive period in development is the pre-implantation in early embryonic development. It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because if the epigenetic marks are not reprogrammed properly, then it can lead to epigenetic abnormalities and possibly, imprinted disorders. For example in assisted reproductive technologies, the embryo is disrupted in both sensitive periods, and has been thought to increase the chance of getting imprinting disorders, such as Angelman Syndrome and Beckwideth Wiedemann syndrome. In cloning, the primordial germ cell development is completely skipped and the success rate of cloning is only a few percent.</p></div>
