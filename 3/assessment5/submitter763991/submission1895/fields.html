    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are not methylated (unless they are imprinted) which allows normal gene expression, including those for tumor suppressor genes. </p>
<p>In some cases, CpG islands in cancerous cell can be hypermethylated whichtends to silence certain genes, such as tumor suppression genes. In other cases, CpG islands may be hypomethylated, allowing proteins to bind to the ICR and inhibit or enhance abnormal gene expression</p>
<p>If tumor suppressor genes are silenced, uncontrolled cell growth can occur.  In addition, CGI methylation in cancerous cells increases with time, spreads throughout the genome, and further disrupts normal gene expression.</p>
<p>In normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated which helps to stabilize the genome by limiting deletions, reciprocal translocations, and/or insertions in the genetic code. </p>
<p>In cancerous cells, these regions are hypomethylated which tends to destabilize the genome, allowing illegitimate recombination events between repeats, activation of repeats, and/or disruption of neighboring genes</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) for the paternal allele of the Igf2/ H19 cluster is methylated, preventing CTCF insulator protein from binding to the ICR which allows enhancers located downstream of the cluster to loop back and act on the Igf2 gene, activating it.  In addition, methylation of the ICR spreads to the promoter region of the H19 gene, effectively silencing it.</p>
<p>The ICR for the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF protein to bind to it.  This bound protein insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers, preventing its expression.  Instead, enhancers loop back to a secondary target and activate the H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumor, imprinting of the ICR in the maternal allele is lost, allowing hypermethylation of the ICR.  This allows enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene and activate it making twice as much Igf2 protein which promotes abnormal growth on the kidney.</p>
<p>If imprinting is disrupted at the Igf2/ H19 cluster, genes, that may be silenced in one allele but active in the other, may be turned completely off or completely on in both.  Abnormal methylation of the ICR can cause methylation to spread upstream/downstream of the ICR, disrupting normal function of many other genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of DNA methylation transferase inhibitors that affects the epigenome by limiting the extent of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>It irreversibly binds to the DNA, preventing hypermethylation of the genome.  Decitabine prevents silencing of normal gene function due to methylation of promoter regions of genes.  Unfortunately, it is not particularly selective and tends to cause general hypomethylation of the genome.  Therefore, Decitabine dosage must be carefully adjusted to be high enough have the beneficial effect of limiting cancerous growth, but not too high to be toxic to the patient.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect because it inhibits methylation of tumor suppressor genes, allowing them to be expressed and limit cancer growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to the epigenome are passed from mother to daughter cells when the cells divide.  That is, epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and so any changes to the epigenome are long lasting.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic marks are erased and/or reestablished on the genome.  </p>
<p>Sensitive periods for the epigenome occur during the blastocyst stage, during germ cell development and imprinting (gamete formation), during slow growth periods in childhood (age 9-12 in grandfathers,age 8-10 in grandmothers), and during the grandmother's pregnancy.</p>
<p>It is unadvisable to treat patients with drugs that alter the epigenome during sensitive periods because they have long lasting effects on the patient and even on future generations.  Also, the drugs used to modify the epigenome are not very selective and they can have unintended negative consequences especially when the epigenome is in a state of flux.</p></div>
