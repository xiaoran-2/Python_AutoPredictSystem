    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGIs):  CGIs can be found in  about 60% of promoter region of the DNA.  CGIs are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. The methylation of non-CGI parts promoter regions inversely correlates with gene expression.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the cancer cells promoter CGIs are more likely to be methylated than in a normal cell (hypermethylated but not all methylated), and this silences  the underlying (e.g. tumor supressive) gene and causes disease.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements:  in the expressed genes the methylation is elevated  in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and in the introns of genes. Characteristic spikes in methylation at exon-intron boundaries can also be observed. DNA methylation maintains genomic stability. Normal recombinations can only happen between regions </div>
<div>that have genetic identity (e.g. same chromosomes)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the cancer cells the repetitive elements, the intergenic elements and the introns are hypomethylated. The hypomethylation occurs most frequently in the repetitive elements. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The consequences of this are illegitimate recombination between repeats, e.g. reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes. Moreover repeats can be activated, make copy of themselves, jump around the genome, may disrupt the coding region of a gene and may activate neighboring genes because of the hypomethylation. In general this leads to genomic instability. Examples: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) null mouse embryo will die around mid-gestation. An adult mouse that has decreased or no levels of DNMT1 just in particular tissues gets cancer. In the craniofacial defects syndrome there is  a mutation in one of the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3B in humans. One of the characteristic features of this disease is genomic instability. </div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, and Igf2 is an insulin-like growth factor 2 on chromosome 11. H19 and Igf2 are expressed in the same tissues during fetal development.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the H19/Igf2 cluster the CTCF imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated and it is unmethylated on the maternal allele.<br /> On the paternal allele, because CTFC is permethylated, it does not binds the insulator elements and the enhancers can act on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed. The H19 promoter region is methylated and consequently no H19 is expressed.<br /> On the maternal allele the CTCF is unmethylated and it binds an insulator element. The enhancers act on H19 (the H19 promoter region is unmethylated) consequently H19 is expressed. In contrast to the paternal allele the Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele (no Igf2 expression).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Wilms' tumor (typically childhood kidney cancer) the CTCF imprint region on the maternal allele is permethylated similar to the paternal allele, and the H19 promoter region is methylated. </div>
<div><br /> Consequently the maternal allele expresses Igf2 similarly to the paternal allele. The two alleles together produce double dose of Igf2 in comparison to normal level. Igf2 is growth promoting, and this is associated with tumor. Practically no H19 is expressed.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</div>
<div>It is used used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</div>
<div>The loss of control of DNA methylation can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer.</div>
<div>It is supposed that the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors create a more orderly DNA methylation thus can have an anti-tumor effect.</div>
</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that epigenetic changes are conserved during cell division to daughter and all descendant cells until these epigenetic marks are actively erased.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the time period when epigenetic reprogramming happens.<br />There are two sensitive periods. The first period happens  during early embryonic development (the maternal genome is passively demethylated while the paternal genome is actively demethylated). Notice that the Imprinted genes are resistant to epigenetic reprogramming during this period of time. During the second period the maternal and paternal genome plus the imprinted genes undergo epigenetic reprogramming in primordial germ cells.<br />Treating patients during sensitive periods would cause serious perturbations in the DNA methylation and that would influence epigenetic reprogramming. For example demethylation of the genome (e.g. the repetitive elements) leads to genomic instability and might lead to various forms of cancer.</p></div>
