    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms playing a pivotal role in gene expression and chromatin compartmentalization. Although, DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable process, it is reversible and generally associated with gene silencing. The state of methylation at CpG island (CGI) found near the promoter region is associated with either activation or silencing of the gene. In normal cells, the CGIs are non-methylated for regular gene expression. However, in cancer, locus specific hyper-methylation of CGIs is observed resulting in the silencing of genes, especially in the tumor suppressor genes (CpG hyper-methylation of p-RB in retinoblastoma). The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), first discovered in colorectal cancer, is unique to each cancer type and subtype. For example CIMP is associated with metastasis in breast cancer and classification of subtypes in gliomas and neuroblastomas. The CpG island shores (neighboring 2kb region on either side of CGIs) are also methylated in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Cancer cells also exhibits genome wide hypo-methylation. In normal cells, the intergenic and repetitive regions are hyper-methylated for genomic stability. Recombination between the repetitive regions requires genetic identity and open chromatin. In normal cells, the repetitive regions are heterochromatinized and abnormal recombination is avoided. Due to hypo-methylation in cancer cells, the DNA is loosely packed which results in abnormal deletion, insertion and translocation of chromosomes resulting in genomic stability. Hypo-methylation also results in activation and transposition of repetitive elements across the genome and disrupts a coding gene or transcription by forming a cryptic promoter. Additionally, the DNA hypo-methylation results in aberrant activation of proto-oncogenes like cMYC and H-RAS in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Hence in cancer cells, the genome wide hypo- or site specific hyper-methylation of DNA contributes to tumorogensis which progresses with tumor progression and ageing. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinted genes exhibit mono-allelic parent of origin expression which implies that allele from either parent is expressed i.e., paternal or maternal. But in cancer cells due to loss of imprinting either both alleles are expressed or silenced. The loss of imprinting might cause from both hypo and hyper methylation of the Imprint Control Region (ICR).</p>
<p>In Wilm’s syndrome, hyper-methylation of ICR is caused by over expression of Igf2. Igf2 is growth promoting hormone expressed from paternal allele in normal cells. In maternal allele, CTCF (insulator protein) binds to the non-methylated ICR and prevents the binding of enhancer with Igf2. A loop is formed between the enhancer and H19 (long non-coding trans-acting RNA) followed by its expression. In paternal allele, the methylated ICR restricts the binding of CTCF and loop is formed between the enhancer and Igf2 which is subsequently expressed. However, in cancer cells due to hyper-methylation of ICR, the maternal allele acts as a paternal allele resulting in the two fold increase in the level Igf2 since it is expressed from both of the alleles. The higher level of Igf2 promotes growth in rapidly dividing cancer cells. <em>(diagram attached)</em>. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hyper-methylation, unlike genetic mutations, is a reversible process. Therapeutic drugs are designed to exploit this phenomenon in reversing the hyper-methylation induced gene silencing, especially of tumor suppressor genes and other cancer-related genes. One such class of drugs is Decitabine, approved by FDA, is used worldwide for the treatment of cancer in lower doses. Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi). DNMT enzyme methylates the DNA during replication in dividing cells. Decitabine acts like nucleoside analogue and forms azacytosine which gets incorporated instead of cytosine. During DNA replication (cell division), when DNMT binds with the azacytosine for methyation, the DNMT is trapped by covalent bond formation with azacytosine and further DNA methylation is inhibited. Further, the methylation mark is removed by DNMT degradation. Therefore, in rapidly proliferating cancer cells, Decitabine have potential effect in reversing DNA hyper-methylation and thus activating abnormally silenced genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>One major challenge in the usage of epigenetic drugs is apart from desired effect in tumor cells, it also alter various epigenetic mechanisms in normal cells. The DNMT inhibitor class of drugs, in addition to the decrease in DNA hyper-methylation in cancer cells, might also cause abnormal hypo-methylation in normal cells. DNMTi, if taken during the sensitive period (such as in puberty), might have serious consequences in genome wide epigenetic machinery. The early developmental and primordial germ cells development, are the two crucial stages where the epigenetic programming takes place i.e., epigenetic markers are removed and laid down again. The DNMTi drugs consumed during these sensitive periods might have various consequences: a) the unavailability of DNMT might result in improper methylation of maternal and paternal genome during reprogramming in both stages; b) the repetitive elements which remains methylated might loss methylation causing genomic instability; c) Loss of DNMT can also cause improper methylation of imprinted genes during primordial germ cell development. In addition, it might also disrupt the maintenance of methylation during early development &amp; d) DNMT loss might reactivate one of the inactive X-chromosome as it is important factor for maintaining X-inactivation. <em>(Diagram attached)<br /><a href="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-50ee8f2f90fcc0101dc10471/970238/asst-5/970238-52121d9d79ade9.38183458.pdf">Fig for 4th question.pdf</a><br /></em></p></div>
