    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at a CPG island is to silence the promoter of the gene. In normal somatic cells CPG islands tend to be unmethylated while gene introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. Inversely, cancer cell CPG islands tend to be methylated while gene introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated. If the CPG island of a tumor suppressor gene it is methylated it is a step toward cancer. Methylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions increases genomic stability. Therefore, removal of methylation in intergenic regions and within repetitive elements decreases stability and can result in cancer inducing mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the Igf2 is methylated on the paternal allele. The Igf2 is not methylated on the maternal allele. When Igf2 the imprint control region is not methylated CTCF binds to it and Igf2 is expressed. If Igf2's imprint control region is methylated CTCF does not bind and expression of Igf2 will occur. In Wilm’s tumor both maternal and paternal imprint control regions are methylated. This prevents CTCF binding in both, allowing both maternal and paternal genes to be expressed. Doubling Igf2 expression in this manner is an early sign of Wilm’s tumor formation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to a class of inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents. By inhibiting DNA methyltransferase Decitabine induces hypomethylated DNA. By creating hypomethylated regions that promote tumor suppressor gene expression, Decabine can be shown to have an anti-tumor effect. This has specific application in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic state is passed on from mother cells to daughter cells. Because of this, epigenetic changes in the genome can have lasting effect. A sensitive period is a period of large scale epigenetic reprogramming. Examples include early germ cell development and early embryonic development. These periods of reprogramming are vital to genomic stability and proper gene expression. Because scientific data has shown that reproductive intervention can be harmed during these sensitive periods, it is best not to purposely alter the epigenetic state in these sensitive periods. Doing so may have long lasting permanent negative effect. </p></div>
