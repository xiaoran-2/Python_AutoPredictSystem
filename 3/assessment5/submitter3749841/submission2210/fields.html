    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CpG dinucleotide rich regions) are located in the upstream promoter region of genes, and are usually unmethylated.  Methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of gene expression via formation of repressive chromatin structures and transcription factor binding site blocking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG islands are often hypermethylated in cancer leading to silencing of gene expression, with the identity of which islands varying by tumour type.  This is particularly the case with CpG island promoters in tumour suppressor genes, as a loss of their expression can lead to aberrant cell proliferation and survival. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation in mitotically heritable due to the maintenance function of Dnmt1 methyltransferase, and such epimutations can cause cells to have a competitive advantage leading to their selection.  Thus, CpG island hypermethylation can contribute to cancer and disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conversely, DNA at intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually methylated.  This is thought to function to maintain genomic integrity.  Intergenic region methylation acts to silence cryptic promoters or splice sites, while repetitive element methylation prevents transposon migration throughout the genome and off-target transcriptional effects such as aberrant gene expression driven by strong transposon promoters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer there is a genome-wide lack of DNA methylation, including at repetitive elements and intergenic regions, and this hypomethylation state is often enhanced as the tumour state progresses.  Such hypomethylation leads to genomic instability, which gives rise to gene and chromosome region deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations between chromosomes.  Genomic instability is often observed in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 gene cluster has paternal imprinted gene expression.  The imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated, which spreads to silence the H19 promoter.  The downstream enhancers therefore preferentially bind the promoter of Igf2 to increase its expression from the paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated, meaning the H19 promoter is also unmethylated.  CTCF, an insulator protein, binds the unmethylated ICR, thereby blocking the enhancer access to the Igf2 promoter, and Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele.  The enhancers instead bind the H19 promoter and increase its expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour is a childhood kidney tumour that develops due to overexpression of Igf2, which results from a loss of paternal imprinting of the H19/Igf2 locus.  Hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele results in expression from both parental alleles, giving a double dose of Igf2 expression. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hypo- and hypermethylation at ICRs can cause a loss of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.  Such methylation changes and loss of imprinting are common in pre-neoplastic and cancerous tissues.  As Igf2 is a growth promoting hormone, its overexpression from both parental alleles leads to tumour growth in Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent that acts by inhibiting DNA methyltransferases.  As a DNA demethylating agent, Decitabine causes hypomethylation.  In the case of some tumour suppressor genes in cancer, their expression would be restricted due to hypermethylation of their promoters.  Decitabine could reverse the hypermethylation, leading to a normal methylation state and expression pattern of the gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which can develop into acute myelogenous leukaemia.  It is thought to function as an anti-cancer therapeutic via two mechanisms:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly, it acts epigenetically by reducing DNA methylation.  By restoring the normal unmethylated state of tumour suppressor genes, they can function normally and control or limit cell growth and proliferation;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Secondly, Decitabine is also a chemotherapeutic antimetabolite, which targets rapidly dividing cells to produce cytotoxic effects, leading to cell death.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus, Decitabine functions as a DNA demethylating agent and chemotherapeutic agent to have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and is passed on to subsequent generations of progeny cells.  Dnmt1 is the maintenance methyltransferase that acts on hemimethylated DNA to maintain full the full methylation state across double-stranded DNA.  Dnmt1 is essential for viability, as knock-out mice are embryonic lethal. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The timing of when DNA methylation changes occur can determine whether subsequent generation of offspring are affected by the same epimutation, as if germ cells developing in the exposed adult are affected by the methylation changes, such changes will be passed on to the next generation. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Epigenetic ‘sensitive periods’ include the periods of epigenetic reprogramming that involve clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks during development, and periods of development when the epigenome is particularly susceptible to environmental signals and changes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods during development: the pre-implantation period in early embryonic development, and primordial germ cell development in the mid-gestational embryo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While treating adult cancer patients with epigenetic drugs may render their tumour cells more susceptible to standard chemotherapy, it may also have unintended or off-target effects for future generations if treating them during sensitive periods, particularly the development of their germ cells (sperm or eggs), and the two sensitive periods during embryonic development.</p></div>
