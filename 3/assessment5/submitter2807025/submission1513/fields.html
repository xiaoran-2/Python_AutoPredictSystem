    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation is silencing the genes and maintaining the stabilities. In normal cell, CpG islands are hypomethylated but in cancer cell they are more likely to be methylated. The hypermethylated CpG islands are found in the tumour suppressor genes. And they can inactivate the tumor suppressor genes. Because of the silence of tumour suppressor genes, the DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted. It could happen genetically or epigenetically and it’s just one of the hits of the tumour.</p>
<p>In normal cell, repetitive element, intergenic region and introns of genes are methylated. This maintains the stabilities of genes. But in cancer cell, they are more likely to be hypomethylated. And this also causes genetic instabilities which result in the abnormal karyotype such as deletion, insertion and reciprocal translocations. These contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, the ICRs in paternal allele are methylated. Because there is no CTCF binding the ICRs, the enhancers act on lgf2 and lgf2 express.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, the ICRS are not methylated because of CTCF binding, the enhancers act on H19, but lgf2 will be silenced.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, because of the hypermethylation of ICRs on the maternal allele, there is no CTCF binding and lgf2 in maternal allele will express by promote of enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, there are 2 expressed lgf2. So now there is a double dose of lgf2 in comparison to the normal cell. Besides, lgf2 is growth promoting and this contributes to the Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p align="left">Decitabine belongs to DNA-demethylating agents i.e. DNMT inhibitors. They are nucleoside analogues and irreversibly bind DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA. The feature of tumour is aberrant methylation and much replication. The Decitabine can have an effect of demethylation and it is replication dependent. So the tumour will be severely affected. Thereby, the Decitabine will have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT and these epigenetic regulators control the epigenetic marks. And when these epigenetic marks are altered by the drugs, they’ll be removed only in the sensitive period.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenetic marks are removed and reestablished. And the sensitive periods of development have 2 parts, the first is early development (preimplantation and postimplantation periods), the second is PGC and GC development.</p>
<p>Why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable? In the sensitive period, the drug’s side effects will be much more performed because of the removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks. And the most important thing is that during the sensitive period, these drugs will affect the offspring of the patient. So this is inadvisable.</p></div>
