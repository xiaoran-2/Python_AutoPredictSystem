<p>DNA methylation is the binding of methyl groups to DNA nucleotides, particularly to cytosine in CpG dinucleotides (CGdns). It stabilizes the genome by silencing gene expression and transcriptional noise by interrupting transcription and compacting chromosomes into heterochromatin, and by preventing the loss, gain and illegitimate crossing-over of chromosomes. Cancer changes how DNA nucleotides are methylated, which has consequences for genome stability and gene expression. The effects are context-dependent.</p>
<p>CpG islands and shores (CGIs) are chromosome sections that are CGdn-rich. They are found in 60% of gene promoters, are normally unmethylated and allow specific gene transcription and expression. Cancer invokes locus-specific methylation of CGIs, interrupting gene transcription and expression (inactivating the genes). This hypermethylation mainly targets the promoters of tumour-suppressor genes, particularly in tumours, and inactivates the genes, which suppress tissue growth by uncontrolled cell division. In this way, hypermethylated CGIs promote uncontrolled cell division and tumour growth and burden. Hypermethylation is mitotically heritable and metastatic; it spreads, and can change what tumours form based on the tissue it occurs in. Sometimes a long-range silencing of genes, called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), occurs, where the CGIs of a long set of genes are more frequently hypermethylated than in other cancers.</p>
<p>Most of the genome consists of intergenic regions containing satellite repetitive elements associated with transcription factor binding sites. These are normally methylated and silent. Cancer destabilizes the genome by hypomethylating these; opening the chromatin, enabling illegitimate cross-over; causing the repeats to copy and transpose throughout the genome; and activating cryptic promoters, disrupting or activating neighbouring genes via noisy transcription. The exact effects are locus-specific but generally lead to promotion of oncogenes, which promote tumour growth via uncontrolled cell division.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

<p>Parentally inherited imprinting controls the expression and silencing of clusters of genes, most of which control primordial germ cell-and-early growth. Each of these clusters is controlled by at least one imprint control region (ICR), which is silenced or imprinted when its DNA is methylated. Silencing of the ICR may silence some of the genes it controls and activate others.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2 and H19 are enhanced by downstream enhancers. In the paternal chromosome, the cluster's ICR and H19's promoter (by downstream spreading) are normally DNA methylated and silenced. Chromatin loops between the enhancers and Igf2, enhancing Igf2 expression and promoting growth. In the maternal chromosome, the protein CTCF insulates the ICR, which is not methylated. The chromatin loops between the enhancers and H19, bypassing Igf2, which the CTCF-ICR complex blocks, keeping Igf2 silent while expressing H19 and suppressing growth. Balanced expression of H19 and Igf2 controls cell division and tissue growth.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour hypermethylates both copies of the H19/Igf2 cluster. CTCF fails to insulate the maternal ICR from methylation, so H19 is not expressed and Igf2 is overexpressed in both chromosomes. Uncontrolled cell division and tissue growth lead to a childhood kidney tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p>Some epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, are mitotically inherited. They retain their state across cell division over generations, until they are actively erased. Treatments involving these mitotically inherited epigenetic changes have a lasting effects after the treatment is completed because the changes remain and spread within the treated tissue. The changes are self-sustaining and do not require maintenance or constant renewal.</p>
<p>The mechanism of this retention is unknown, but may involve maternal oocyte-derived maternal-effect proteins that bind DNA to protect specific methylated regions from demethylation during early development.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, either add or remove epigenetic markers, in this case methyl groups, during the treatment. If this occurs during a sensitive period, either during early or primordial germ cell development, when organism-developmental markers are being laid as well, then treatment may adversely confuse the development of the organism.</p>

<p>The nucleoside analogue DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) Decitabine treats myelodysplastic syndromes, precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), by incorporating itself into DNA and irreversibly binding and inhibiting DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Low doses of Decitabine lead to DNA demethylation by an unknown mechanism. It may inhibit tumour-suppressor gene-hypermethylation and silencing, which tumour growth seems to depend on. With tumour-suppressor less methylated and more active, uncontrolled cancer cell division and tumour growth is inhibited. This effect is retained and spread through daughter cells via mitotic inheritance. Cancer is intensely affected as it involves uncontrolled division and mitotic inheritance and spreading. A negative feedback fights tumour growth. At high doses, however, Decitabine is ineffective at inhibiting DNA methylation and is toxic. Additionally, other actions of Decitabine are unknown. It acts generally, rather than specifically, so side effects and long-term consequences may be problematic.</p>
