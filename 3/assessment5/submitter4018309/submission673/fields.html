    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is aberrant in cancer via two main factors: locus specific DNA hypermethylation (mainly in CpG islands and CpG island shores) and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation (mainly in repetitive regions and CpG-poor promoters and loss of imprinting in ICRs).</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation of CpG islands is the silencing of the genes controlled by the promoters where the CpG islands are located. This methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, i.e. it is mitotically heritable. In cancer, this function is disrupted as there is hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Hence, the inhibitory activity of these genes on cell growth and proliferation is impaired, contributing to tumorigenesis by enhanced tumor cell proliferation. Importantly, this is also true for CpG island shores, i.e. a region of 2 kb neighboring CpG islands (which is usually correlated with DNA hypermethylation and silencing of gene expression).</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands which are usually unmethylated in normal cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements of the genome are usually methylated. This DNA methylation has an important role in the maintenance of genomic integrity/ stability due to silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and because methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. A cancer cell, however, displays unmethylated intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which results in genomic instability due to: (i) illegitimate recombination between repeats; (ii) activation of repeats and transposition, and (iii) activation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Genomic instability is a feature of cancer cells, resulting for example in changes in ploidy (chromosome copies), and favours tumorogenicity via several complex mechanisms that ultimately may result in the generation of mutants that can be selected by the environment (i.e. overcompete neighboring cells in terms of proliferation).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can actively contribute to cancer, mainly due to aberrant DNA methylation (hypo or hypermethylation) of imprint control regions (ICRs) which can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster, where the gene Igf2 shows different expression patterns between maternal and paternal alleles. In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated which blocks the binding of CTCF (an insulator protein) to this region. Without CTCF binding, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate its expression. Contrarily, in the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated allowing the binding of CTCF which prevents (insulates) the downstream enhancers from triggering Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR of this cluster is hypermethylated resulting in Igf2 overexpression, i.e. the loss of imprinting caused by the methylation of the maternal allele makes cancer cells express Igf2 in both alleles whereas in normal cells it is only expressed in the paternal allele. Since Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, its overexpression favours tumorigenicity as cancer cells proliferate more than neighboring (normal) cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, i.e. impairs DNA methylation by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme(s) with such function. As such, since the maintenance/ mitotic heritability of DNA methylation requires DNA methyltransferase activity, Decitabine causes DNA demethylation. This counters several processes seen in cancer cells such as the hypermethylation of locus- specific DNA regions (such as CpG islands and ICRs), gain/ consolidation of long range epigenetic silencing (LRES) dependent on increased DNA-methylation, and histone modification (due to addition of repressive methylation marks – H3K9me and H3K27me). Thus, given that these DNA and histone methylations decrease tumor suppressor gene expression (whose function is to restrict cancer cell growth and proliferation), Decitabine exhibits an anti-tumorigenic effect by countering this inhibition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation pharmacologically can have lasting effects on the epigenome beyond the period of drug treatment, because DNA methylation is regarded as a stable epigenetic mark that needs to be maintained throughout cell division. DNA methylation is laid down by <em>de novo</em> methyltransferases but after cell division, only one DNA strand per cell has methylated DNA, which requires the activity of an additional methyltransferase to add the methyl groups to the unmethylated DNA strand. Thus, if the drug inhibits methyltransferase activity, the maintenance of the methylation status is impaired and the cell loses its DNA methylation patterns upon cell division (e.g. rendering cancer cells more susceptible to chemotherapeutics over time).</p>
<p>A sensitive period is defined by the establishment of active remodeling processes of the epigenome, for example maternal and paternal genome DNA demethylation as well as that of imprinted genes. In this regard, pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development are considered sensitive periods. As such, it is not advisable to treat patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods as the side effects (aberrant epigenetic regulation) would be greatly enhanced and may cause further effects in germ cells that can be inherited by the subsequent generation.</p></div>
