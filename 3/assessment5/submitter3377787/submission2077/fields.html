    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In normal cells, CpG islands (CGIs) are hypomethylated with hypermethylation occurring at intergenic regions and repeats.  In cancer, hypermethylation is at the CpG islands with hypomethylation occurring at the intergenic regions and repeats.  In other words, hypomethylation and hypermethylation are reversed between CGIs and the intergenic regions/repeats in cancer cells compared to normal cells.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Hypomethylation of CGIs, associated with gene expression, allows the activation of tumour suppressor genes in normal cells.  CpG island methylation silences tumour suppressor genes in cancer cells.  Deactivating tumour suppressor genes may be one of the hits of the Knudson hypothesis.  CGI methylation progresses with time and age.  Although tumour suppressor silencing by methylation is more common than mutations, it varies by type of tumour.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Hypomethylation at repeats and intergenic regions promote genomic instability including illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption of nearby genes.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The loss of imprinting can result in the overexpression of a gene contributing to tumourigenesis or cancer.  An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster.  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>For the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele.  CTCF cannot bind to the methylated paternal ICR resulting in expression of Igf2 through the action of enchancers but CTCF binds to the unmethylated maternal ICR causing the enchancers act on H19 rather than Igf2.  Hence, the paternal allele normally expresses Igf2 whereas the maternal allele does not.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>When the maternal ICR is methylated, the CTCF cannot bind creating the same scenario as the paternal allele.  Thus, imprinting is lost and both alleles express Igf2.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Loss of imprinting results with overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoter, causing Wilm's tumour.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Decitabine, a DNA-demethylating agent (azacitidine), is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precedents of myelogenous leukaemia.  Decitabine decreases DNA methylation. Demethylation produces an anti-tumour effect by activation of tumour suppressor genes, which have been deactivated by methylation.  DNA methylation has an epigenetic association with gene silencing.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Epigenetic changes are mitotically inheritable.  Alteration of DNA methylation changes or erases epigenetic marks.  Once cancer-causing epigenetic marks are erased, they do not return.  A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being established during early embryonic development and germ cell development.  Treatment during sensitive periods could disrupt establishment of normal epigenetic marks.  Therefore, "epigenetic drug" treatment of young children and pregnant women would probably not be advisable.</span></span></span></p></div>
