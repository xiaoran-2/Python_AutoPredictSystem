    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found in promoter regions and tend to be unmethylated in normal conditions, with some exceptions, related with gene silencing, for example in X-chromosome inactivation. CpG islands are found mainly in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands become hypermethylated, then the genes controlled by those promoters are silenced. So, in cancer cells we find that tumor suppressor genes are silenced because their promoters present CpG islands hypermethylated.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CpGs are normally methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In intergenic regions DNA methylation avoids  transcriptional noise, for example transcription regulated by cryptic promoters. In repetitive elements, DNA methylation maintains genomic integrity, impairing the expression of the proteins  that are responsible for cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste the repetitive elements. In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, so there is transcriptional noise and genomic integrity is broken.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an inhibitor of a DNA methyltransferase, so it impairs DNA methylation. It can have an anti-tumour effect because in cancer CpG islands are hypermethylated, then tumour suppressor genes are silenced. If those promoters are demethylated, tumour suppressor genes are expressed, which has an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, and if it is erased, it does not return; so if a drug erases a methyl mark, this mark is erased forever in the daughter cells. A sensitive period in development is a period when the brain present a high degree of plasticity, and the environment can affect the brain for all the lifespam. In these periods, DNA methylation marks are established because of different experiences, and this epigenetic programming remains forever. Sensitive periods take place early in development (10 days in rats, 1000 days in humans). Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because can affect the structure and function of the brain (and in turn the behaviour) for all the lifespam.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster contains the Igf2 gene, that codifies for an oncogene (it promotes growth), an imprint control region (ICR) (can be methylated or unmethylated), the H19 gene, that is a lncRNA which bounds to CTCF, which is an insulator protein, and enhancer regions. It is an example of imprinted genes (is paternally imprinted). In the maternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster the ICR is unmethylated, H19 is bound to CTCF, that insulates Igf2; then, the enhancers are available for H19. So H19 expression is enhanced and Igf2 expression is avoided. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so CTCF can´t bind to it and the enhancers remain available for Igf2 gene. Also, the methylation of ICR spreads into H19 promoter, so H19 is not expressed. So Igf2 expression is enhanced and H19 expression is avoided.</p>
<p>In  Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome both alleles act as the paternal allele, leading to an overexpression of Igf2. This could happen because of a mutation or deletion that causes loss of imprinting, for example.  This overexpression of Igf2 is related with a predisposition to embryonic or childhood tumours, like Wilm's tumour.</p>
