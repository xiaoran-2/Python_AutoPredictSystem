    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the

    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Function of DNA methylation at CpG islands :</li>
</ol><p>methylation is the addition of metyhl group to cytosine ,as the DNA is asymmetrical ,methylation allow DNA to maintain through cell divison and is one of the features of epigenatic modification .</p>
<p>CpG clustered into CpG islands are the promotor of genes where transcription machinary happens</p>
<p>CpG islands tend to be always unmethylated</p>
<p>methylation at CpG islands result in silencing of gene expression</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methlation at CpG islands in cancer :</p>
<p>cancer is the result of multiple hits of DNA .</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG Islands preceding gene promoters are generally unmethylated, while other individual CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome tend to be methylated .However,in cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated, while CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often decreased .</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in silencing of those genes.This type of epigenetic mutation is dangerous when genes that regulate the cell cycle are silenced, allowing cells to grow and reproduce uncontrollably, leading to tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is an alternative  to genatic mutation to silance tumor suppressor genes in cancer .</p>
<p>EXAMPLES of hyermethylation (retinoblastoma,colorectal cancer,breast cancer)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NORMAL FUNCTION OF DNA METHYLATION IN INTEGENIC REGION AND REPITATIVE ELEMENTS :</p>
<p> in both maintain genomic stability ,silencing of repeats to prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interferance from strong promotors ,methylation prevent illeitimate recombination,mutation of repeats lead prevent transposition .</p>
<p>without methylation of intergenic region result in (deletion,insertion,and reciprocal translocation)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THERE DISRUPTION IN CANCER :</p>
<p>hypomethylation at intergenic region and repeats and genomic instability ,genomic instability that will leads to deletion,reciprocal,translocation and insertion .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;

    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><ol><li><span style="font-family:times, 'times new roman', serif;font-size:medium;"><strong>THE paternal and maternal genomes are not equivalent and both are required for mammalian development. The difference between the parental genomes is believed to be due to gamete-specific differential modification, a process known as genomic imprinting.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:times, 'times new roman', serif;font-size:medium;"><strong>The study of transgene methylation has shown that methylation patterns can be inherited in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, suggesting that DNA methylation may play a role in genomic imprinting. CpG islands in three imprinted genes, <em>H19</em>, insulin-like growth factor 2 <em>(Igf-2)</em>, and <em>lgf-2</em> receptor <em>(Igf-2r)</em>, are differentially methylated depending on their parental origin.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:times, 'times new roman', serif;font-size:medium;"><strong>  expression of all three genes was affected in mutant embryos: the normally silent paternal allele of the <em>HI9</em> gene was activated, whereas the normally active paternal allele of the <em>Igf-2</em> gene and the active maternal allele of the<em>Igf-2r</em> gene were repressed. Our results demonstrate that a normal level of DNA methylation is required for controlling differential expression of the paternal and maternal alleles of imprinted genes.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family:times, 'times new roman', serif;font-size:medium;"><strong>RELAXATION of IGF2 imprinting occur in wilm tumour ,by displaying normal IGF2 imprinting .</strong></span></li>
</ol><p><span style="font-family:times, 'times new roman', serif;font-size:medium;"><strong>in wilm tumour with relaxed imprinting LOH this region was un methylated ,and this tumour is associated with loss of maternal allele specific methylation from a region located up stream of the imprinting IGF2 promotors .</strong></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

<div class="_kso fsm direction_ltr _55r0"><span class="null">The change of DNA methylation has enduring effects because it's mitotically heritable by the action of DNA methyltransferases. Therefore, it has  effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.</span></div>
</div>
<p>sensitive periods:</p>
<p>This is the period of development when environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the animal. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks) and include:</p>
<ol><li>Primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm   </li>
<li>Preimplantation and postimplantation periods.   </li>
</ol><p>Somatic maintenance period seems to be periods of least sensitivity</p>
<p>and they predominate durind establishment of epigenatic marks rather than maintanance of epigenatic marks .</p>
<p>as in sensitive periods is the period if altration happen it will pass to the generation so will make mutation and silancing in the gene and deformity in the off spring called transgenerational inheritance</p></div>
