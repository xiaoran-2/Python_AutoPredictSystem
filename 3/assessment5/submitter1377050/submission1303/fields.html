    <h1>Submission 1303 from Anon (session_user_id: b2ba9603694b4da574d2ac3ff2ed2384525109ca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the <span>DNA-demethylating class of inhibitors which provide a promising approach to cancer research. Cancer is caused by the hypermethylaton of promoter CpG islands which silences the underlying gene. A DNA-demethlater like Decitabine removes the hypermethylation found in cancerous tissue. This removal of the hypermethylation allows the gene to once again be expressed. The change in methylation would be passed on to the next generation of cells because DNA methylation gets passed on from one generation to the next.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group, a modification that can regulate gene expression. CpG islands typically are not methylated however in cancer cells promoter CpG islands are hypermethylated which silences the underlying gene. By changing the methylation at CpG islands certain effects can be achieved. Oncogenes are activated and tumour supressors are inactivated which causes disease and mutation. Intergenic and repetitive elements are methylated in a normal cell and are unmethylated or hypomethylated in cancer. When the DNA methylation of these regions is disrupted as is the case in cancer you get genomic instability; deletions, repeats and/or insertions. Change in the methylation region of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can contribute disease by increasing the instability of the chromosome which enhances tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark, meaning it gets passed on to <span>subsequent </span> generations, it often has lasting effects on the epigenome. During gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells inserted into pluripotent stem cells the epigenome undergoes a sensitive period which is the reprogramming of DNA methylation. Treating patients during the sensitive period would be inadvisable because any changes to the epigenome would get erased as a result of the reprogramming. The changes therefore would not get passed down to the next generation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell Igf2 is an imprinted gene and is only expressed on one allele. The paternal allele is hypermethylated which causes it to express Igf2, the maternal allele is unmethylated so <span>enhancers </span>acting though H19 deactivate Igf2. In Wilm's tumour there is a loss of imprinting so both alleles are hypermethylated which leads to the overexpression of Igf2. This overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth <span>promoting </span>gene leads to tumors and mutation become increasingly prolific.</p></div>
