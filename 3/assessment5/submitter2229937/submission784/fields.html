    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is characterized by aberrant methylation pattern.Promoters or exons contain CpG islands which  are usually unmethylated in normal cells.Methylation of CpG island lead to Inhibition of transcription initiation, condensed chromatin and inhibition of transcription initiation.CpG islands are hyper methylated in cancer cells causing silencing of the genes resuling in hyperproliferation of cells.Hypermethylation of CpG islands contributes to silencing of many genes associated with different  pathways involved in apoptosis, DNA repair and cell cycle regulation causing diseases. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is to maintain genomic integrity. The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is to <span>protect the genome from transposable elements. <span>Long interspersed nuclear elements are the most plentiful mobile DNAs or retrotransposons in the human genome. Cancer also involves hypomethylation of repeated DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements. <span>Hypomethylation has been hypothesized to contribute to oncogenesis by activation of oncogenes such as </span><em>cMYC</em><span> and </span><em>H-RAS<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;"> </span></em><span>or by activation of latent retrotransposon or by <span>chromosome instability. Chromosome instability and aberrant gene expression are involved in progression of diseases due to hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements cause different diseases.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is a genetic phenomenon by which certain genes can be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. It may also ensure transposable elements remain epigenetically silenced throughout gametogenic reprogramming to maintain genome integrity. <span>non-imprinted allele can be paternally inherited or maternally inherited. H19 genes is an example wherein  <span>non-imprinted allele inherited from the mother while Igf2  the non-imprinted allele is inherited from father (IGF-2). </span></span>Wilms' tumor cells have shown loss of <span class="glossaryTermLink">imprinting</span> of the maternal <span class="ontologyTermLink">chromosome</span> and a switch to the paternal pattern of <span class="ontologyTermLink">methylation</span>. Moreover, <em>H19</em> <span class="ontologyTermLink">mRNA</span> expression was decreased at least twentyfold in most Wilms' tumors, indicating that <em>H19</em> is inactivated in tumor cells. This results in the overexpression of <em>IGF2</em>and reduced expression of <em>H19</em>. Because <em>H19</em> functions to slow <span class="ontologyTermLink">cell</span> growth and <em>IGF2</em> stimulates <span class="ontologyTermLink">cell</span> growth, loss of <span class="glossaryTermLink">imprinting</span> at the <em>H19</em>/<em>IGF2</em> <span class="glossaryTermLink">locus</span>results in uncontrolled <span class="ontologyTermLink">cell</span> growth that can lead to tumor formation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>The biological significance of DNA methylation in the regulation of gene expression and its role in cancer is increasingly recognized. </span> Deoxy derivative of azacitidine <span>Decitabine</span> is a powerful inhibitors of DNA methylation. Decitabine is a demethylating agents and involves in gene reactivation of genes aberrantly<strong> </strong>silenced in cancer such as those involved in apoptosis and regulation of cell cycle.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to many generations. So altered epigenetics is passed on to daughter cells as well,  and thus have enduring effect. <span> It is generally believed that early life constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanism. Sensitive period is the early development.<span>this epigenetic program is established early in development and thought to be maintained throughout life. </span></span></span>It is not advisable treat patients during sensitive period  as treatment with these drug can leave an  aberrant epigenetic programming of somatic cells and germ cells as well. </p></div>
