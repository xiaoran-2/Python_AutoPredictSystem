    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands (CGI) are short sequences of DNA with a high density of guanine followed by cytosine along its length. Cytosine bases of CGI can be methylated on carbon 5.  CGI are found in more than a half of the gene promoters and their methylation is associated with gene transcription repression. This can occurs by allowing the binding of proteins that can inhibit transcription and that also recruit factors able to condense the chromatin, which alters accessibility of RNA polymerase and factors involved in the transcription process.</p>
<p>It is known that a tumour appears as an imbalance between oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, with victory for oncogenes.  In spite of, in normal cells, CGI are usually unmethylated, tumour cells tend to show hypermethylation on promoters of tumour suppressor genes (for instance, pro-apoptotic molecules and DNA-repairing proteins). As methylation of CGI is associated with repression of transcription, tumour is more prone to develop.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, however, there is a genome-wide hypomethylation, mainly led by the hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. However, in normal cells, these sequences are usually methylated. By silencing cryptic transcription start sites, methylation in intergenic regions prevents that RNA polymerase recognizes a sequence other than the correct promoter. By their repetitive sequence, repetitive elements are prone to an illegitimate recombination, and their activation can led to transposition into another place throughout the genome.Methylation of repetitive elements avoids these events to occur. </p>
<p>Thus, the methylation of both intergenic regions and repetitive elements reduce the probability of genetic instability, that, in other way, could contribute in a major degree to cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>After DNA is methylated <em>de novo,</em> the maintenance of cytosine methylation is performed by DNMT1, a methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine is an irreversible DNMT1 inhibitor. As this drug is a nucleoside analogue, once replication occurs, it can be incorporated in the new DNA strands. Decitabine will bind to DNMT1, competing with cytosines by this methyltransferase, leading to DNA hypomethylation. A feature of several cancer cells (and cells of some pre-cancerous conditions) is hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoters of tumour suppressor genes. In this way, their transcription is repressed and cell proliferation is disregulated, leading to cancer. However, decitabine-induced hypomethylation in cancer cells may re-establish the function of tumour suppressor genes; that is a reason why Decitabine has anti-tumour effects. Nevertheless, it can only be used in cells able to replicate. Decitabine was approved to treatment of myelodisplasic syndrome, a hematological condition that can precede acute myeloid leukemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During development, there are sensitive periods related to epigenome, in which extensive epigenetic reprograming is occurring. By the mentioned reason, during this time, epigenome is more vulnerable to external insults that can interfere with processes involved in the reprogramming. Sensitive periods of development include the germ cell development, pre-implantation and early development of embryos.</p>
<p>Epigenetic marks on DNA are maintained through cell division. This way, altering DNA methylation pattern can have enduring effects on the epigenome, because daughter cells will also show the alterations that occurred in the progenitors.</p>
<p>Therefore, during sensitive periods of development, treatment of patients with drugs that affect DNA methylation is unadvisable.</p>
<p>Currently, there are several drugs in clinical trials that change DNA methylation. However, only four were already approved to be used in treatment - for myelodisplasic syndrome and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. </p>
<p>Actually, accordingly with their drug labels, these drugs have potential teratogenic effects if administered during pregnancy, hence their use during this period is not recommended. Men should also not be fathers while receiving treatment. However, the safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established yet.</p>
<p>Changes in DNA methylation in somatic cells can also have undesirable effects, as neoplasms. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the expression of the imprinted genes depends on the DNA methylation pattern of CpG in a specific imprinting control region, the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, there is no transcription of Igf2 because CTCF, a protein that binds to the unmethylated H19 promoter, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. However, in the paternal allele, H19 promoter is hypermethylated, blocking the binding of CTCF. Without this protein, DNA methylation spreads and is able to silence H19 promoter, allowing the access of enhancers to activate Igf2 transcription.</p>
<p>As H19 encodes a long non-coding RNA with numerous functions and Igf2 is considered an oncogene by its crucial role in pre-natal growth and development, the impairment of imprinting in this cluster can lead to disease.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, both of the alleles show H19 promoter hypermethylation and, in consequence, there is Igf2 overexpression.  </p>
<p>Beckwith-Wiedermann syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome, can derive from abnormalities in this cluster, with maternal allele behaving like paternal allele, which also leads to Igf2 overexpression. Individuals suffering from this syndrome are more prone to embryonic and childhood tumors, as Wilms tumour.</p></div>
