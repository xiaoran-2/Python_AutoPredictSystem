    <h1>Submission 1213 from Anon (session_user_id: 7dab6f54d97664b4dbd341dfa9af765cf734a30f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine ('Dacogen') is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
<p>It belongs to what is called 'hypomethylating' or 'demethylating'  agents or 'DNA methyltransferase inhibitors'. It is an anti-tumour ( or antineoplastic / cytotoxic / antimetabolite) chemotherapy drug.</p>
<p>DNA methylation regulates gene expression, an increase in which can block the activity of 'suppressor genes' that regulate cell division and this can indirectly lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Mechanisms of action:</p>
<ul><li>Decitabine either demethylates the DNA or interferes with the DNA methylation. It gets incorporated into the DNA after replication and when the DNA methyltransferase come to bind to the DNA, the drug binds is irreversibly, thus inhibiting its action. In this way it restores the normal function of the 'suppressor genes' and hence regulates cellular proliferation.</li>
<li>Sometimes, it acts as  'antimetabolites' and produces a cytotoxic effect, killing the dividing cells. </li>
<li>It may also bring about DNA damage. This inhibits protein synthesis and hence cell death occurs.</li>
</ul></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the CpG islands are usually unmethylated whereas the repetitive regions, the intergenic regions and introns are heavily methylated. The vice versa is seen in cancerous cells.</p>
<p>The CpG islands are normally present in the promoter regions of genes (mainly Tumour Suppressing Genes). They are usually unmethylated but when partially methylated, they are involved in gene silencing (hence repressing gene expression) and X chromosome inactivation. It helps to maintain genomic stability and prevents illegitimate recombinations and hence prevents diseases.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated. This leads to loss of genomic stability. The TSG might become silenced and hence they will not be able to regulate (i.e. suppress) cell division and differentiation. This uncontrolled cell division can lead to cancers. The loss of genomic stability can lead to illegitimate recombinations which can cause cancer.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells. This serves to maintain genomic integrity and stability. It helps in silencing cryptic promoters and cryptic splice sites, it avoids transcriptional interference and illegitimate recombinations by preventing transposition from taking place. Usually recombination occurs between regions of similarity in the genome. Since the repetitive regions are methylated, the similarity that is needed for recombination is lost and mutations don’t take place.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there is genome wide hypomethylation. This hypomethylation causes genetic instabilities due to increase in similarity of regions and allows mutations such as deletions, translocations, etc to occur.</p>
<p>Sometimes the repeats get activated due to such hypomethylation. They make copies of themselves and transpose them elsewhere. This can disrupt coding regions, activate neighboring genes, activate certain promoters or bring about transcriptional aberrations.</p>
<p>All of the above would increase in chance of mutations and would also increase the division of cells, thus leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 ICR is unmethylated in the maternal allele, which is bound by the CTCF protein (insulator protein), which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers by restrciting the access of the Igf2 to the enhancers. Thus, the enhancers act on H19 and increase the expression of the H19 allele.</p>
<p>The ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. The CTCF protein can no longer bind to it. Thus, the enhancers will act on the Igf2 and promote the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Hence, Igf2 is expressed only in the paternala allele and not in the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, activation of the silenced maternal Igf2 allele is seen. This leads to biallelic expression of Igf2 (accompanied by epigenetic modification of H19), which is a key event in Wilm's tumour. This is teamed with loss of cdnk1c,  a tumor suppressor. The net result is that there is no cdnk1c expression and there is too much of lgf2 expression. Thus, the maternal alleles act like paternal alleles and these will continue with their normal behavior. This leads to somatic overgrowth and predisposition of tumour.The loss of imprinted genes and overexpression of growth promoting factors are the hallmarks of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5th Carbon of the cytosine pyrimidine ring by the action of enzymes called <span>DNA methyltransferases</span>. It helps to maintain genomic stability and integrity and in the correct proportions can prevent recombinations and hence prevents diseases. If changes occur in the methylation, it can lead to loss of genomic stability and it can bring about mutations which can causes diseases. One thing to be remembered is that DNA methylation is reversible and more importantly it is mitotically heritable. The effects can last for a afew generations and hence any change can have enduring effects on the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period of development when environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup of the animal. The sensitive periods are the periods when the epigenome is actively remodeled (i.e., removal and reestablishment of epigenetic marks) and include:</p>
<ol><li>Primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm   </li>
<li>Preimplantation and postimplantation periods.   </li>
</ol><p>It would not be advisable to treat patients during this period as there are constant epigenetic changes taking place  and this can lead to some adverse unwanted changes from the drugs with respect to DNA methylation and epigenetic expression.</p></div>
