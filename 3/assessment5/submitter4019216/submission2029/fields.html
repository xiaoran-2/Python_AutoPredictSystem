    <div class="field-value"><p>Most CpG islands are not methylated in normal cells. However, when methylation occurs in promoter regions, it is associated with gene silencing. The net effect of methylation is to maintain a repressive chromatin structure and prevent transcription factor binding. In cancer, there is a general trend toward DNA hypermethylation in specific loci and a genome-wide trend for DNA hypomethylation to occur. The DNA hypermethylation in malignancy often occurs at the CpG islands and shores of tumor suppressor genes, so these genes would be turned off, resulting in a lack of expression of elements that normally would be controlling and/or restricting cell growth and/or cell death. Also, DNA methylation is mutagenic due to deamination of 5-methyl cytosine resulting in its conversion to thymine.</p>
<p>In the intergenic regions, introns, and repetitive elements, DNA methylation is thought to be involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome, and these regions are usually methylated in normal cells but not methylated in tumors. So in cancer, the net effect is that normal controls resulting from methylation-induced silencing are lost.</p>
<p>For intergenic regions, demethylation of potential alternative/cryptic transcription and splicing sites allows the capacity for aberrant transcription or splicing to occur, resulting in the potential for production of altered/abnormal gene products.</p>
<p>Normal methylation silences repetitive elements, thus preventing transposition as well as blocking transcriptional interference from other strong promoters. Mutation of the repeats (as described above) from meC to T also acts to prevent transposition. However, in tumors, these sites generally are not methylated thus allowing increased capacity for aberrant transcriptional interference, inappropriate transposition, and possibly allowing illegitimate recombination events to take place.</p>
<p>Methylation changes can result in insertions, deletions, translocations, and/or chromosome duplication, and removal of tumor suppressor controls, all of which could cause disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypo or hyper methylation at the imprint control regions (ICR) can alter aspects of growth control. At the H19/Igf2 cluster, on the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. When CTCF insulator protein binds at the unmethylated ICR, it insulates the oncogene Igf2 from the effect of enhancers downstream to its locus. So there is no up-regulation of this growth-promoting gene. Instead, the H19 lncRNA promoter is acted upon by the enhancers and is upregulated. </p>
<p>However, on the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks the binding of the CTCF protein, so the enhancers now have access to activate Igf2. In addition, the methylation on the paternal ICR spreads downstream and blocks the promoter for H19.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation at this ICR can result in the loss of parental imprinting, and the overexpression of an oncogene-Igf2- resulting in the kidney tumor- Wilm’s tumor- in children.</p>
<p>In Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome the maternal allele behaves like a paternal allele so effectively you have two paternal alleles. There is a concomitant loss of a tumor suppressor (Cdkn1c) along with upregulation of the Igf2 oncogene, so you have excess growth promotion and a loss of tumor suppression capability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog which acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) after it is incorportated into the DNA during replication. It acts by binding to DNA methyltransferases irreversibly, and blocking this enzymatic activity. This results in a reduction of the capacity for methylating DNA in trhe cell. </p>
<p>Decitabine is both toxic and non-specific so the drug dose has to be fine-tuned to the window where it is most effective in blocking methylation of DNA with the least amount of toxicity.</p>
<p>While the mechanism of action as well as long term effects are still unclear, a possible mechanism of action could be that If CpG island hypermethylation at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes is reduced or blocked, then these genes should remain active, thus being enabled to continue their normal function of suppressing growth of malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs which alter DNA methylation status in tumor cells may act to reverse some of the loss of growth control mechanisms seen in cancer by altering the epigenetic changes that have been established by the tumors. If these changes are in the epigenetic marks that have been laid down, then they would be mitotically heritable in subsequent cell generations until they are actively erased. So any drug-induced changes that altered methylation status, for example, (or other aspects of the epigenetic machinery) could be passed on to daughter cells. This is how the drug effects could be potentiated after treatment is stopped.</p>
<p>It would be prudent to avoid treating patients during sensitive periods such as in pregnant women during periods of early embryonic development and while primordial germ cells are being established or in the case of young patients during periods of germ cell maturation. It would be inadvisable to treat during these times as these periods are when the epigenetic marks are being remodeled (laid down and/or erased and reestablished), hence the use of the descriptor "sensitive".</p></div>
