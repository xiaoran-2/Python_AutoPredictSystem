    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, ie, areas with a large density of CpG dinucleotides, are present at most gene promoters. In normal cells, CpG islands are kept free from DNA methylation regardless of expression states. When DNA methylation does occur in such islands, its usually associated with stable gene silencing, iimportant for epigenetic phenoms like gene imprinting and X-chromossome inactivation.</p>
<p>In cancar cells, however, CpG islands are frequently hypermethylated. This leads to abnormal gene silencing, specialy silencing tumor supressor genes. This consists in an alternate to mutation as a "hit" to DNA, producing genome instability and inducing tumor proliferation. DNA methylation is mitoticly inheritable, what allows cummulative epigenetic alterations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated in normal cells. Silencing of those regions is important to avoid genomic instability. In cancer cells, a genome-wide hypomethylation occurs, resulting in activation of repetitve elements and intergenic regions, what leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition, activation of cryptic promoters (and disruption of neighbouring genes), all this strongly contibuting to genomic instability and cummulative mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alterations of methylation pattern in ICR can result in overexpression of oncogenes and supression of tumor supressor genes. Such alterations play an important role in carcinogenesis, and may consist in an early abnormality once they are frequently present in pre-neoplastic tissues.</p>
<p>H19 is the gene for a long non-coding RNA. Its expression is imprintedly controled by its ICR. In normal cells, the ICR is methylated in the paternal chromossome and not methylated in the maternal chromossome, what means H19 is transcripted only in the maternal chromossome. Transcription of H19 leads to repression in cis of the Igf2 gene, what means that Igf2 is usually expressed by the paternal chromossome and silenced in the maternal chromossome.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, hypermethylation of the ICR controling the H19/Igf cluster leads to expression of both maternal and paternal Igf gene, promoting abnormal cell growth and therefore contributing to tumor progression. This event is well described in the carcinogenesis of Wilm's tumor, but can occur in other cancer types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue odified in the position 5 of the pyrimidine ring. Although it may have direct cytoxic effects in higher doses (similiar to other nucleoside analogues) its used in practice at a lower dose, when it works as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), and therefore can be classified as an epigenetic inhibitor. Decitabine inhibits DNMT activaty, resulting in DNA hypomethylation, what can bring re-expression of tumor supressor genes, promotion of cell diferentiation and stimulation of immune mechanisms.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used in the treatment of myelodisplastic syndrome and is currently being investigated as a possible drug agaisnt othe cancer types.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation patterns are mitoticly inheritable. That means they will be transmitted to daughter cells and so on, therefore DNA methylation modifications are both durable and cummulative. Drugs that alter DNA methylation mechanism may lead to expression of some genes and supression of others, and such changes can also be inheritated by mitosis, what means that daughter cells will present modifications suffered by their parents even if themselves have never been exposed to the drug.</p>
<p>A sensitive period for epigenetic regulation is when the cell can be passing through epigenetic reprogramming. DNA methylation levels tend to be lower In this period, drugs or other factors interfering with epigenetics may have lager-than-expected side effects, and therefore should be avoided if possible. Examples of such sensitive periods are: embryonic cell development, and primordial germ cell development.</p></div>
