    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands methylation is normally found in X-chromosome inactivation, imprinted genes such as Igf-2, H19, and Igf-2r,Alu sequences and L1 retrotransposon Sequences.mehylisation of of CpG islands is not usuallly found in normal cells.</p>
<p>The CpG islands within the promoter regions of the X-linked housekeeping genes become methylated resulting in inactivation of the genes, this inactivation is inheritable.</p>
<p>This methylation is thought to be part of a host defense system that ensures the silencing of foreign DNA.</p>
<p> In cancers denovo methylisation of CpG islands and increased levels of DNA methyltransferase enzyme have been observed. The CpG islands that are methylated in these cancer cells are usually found in growth-regulation genes and the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes containing CpG islands may be susceptible to random methylisation errors resulting inpartial methylisation of previously unmethylated CpG islands. This could result in down-regulation of particular growth suppressing gene and thus lead to an increased growth rate. This is mitotically inherited and reversible.The epigenetic changes in methylation patterns can cause induction of point mutations that inactivate tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>DNA is mostly made up of intergenic regions or repetitive elements. In normal cells these are normally methylated this results in genomic stability that reduces  recombinations possibilities either gain or loss of function .</p>
<p>in cancer cells these are found to be hypomethylated thus increasing the chance of illegitimate recombinations between repeats ie reciprical translocations. This does not happen with normally hypermethylated repeats. Transcriptional aberration in the surroundind regions may occur.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The regulation of gene imprinting occurs at CpG enriched imprinting control regions (ICR),  depending upon parent of origin during germline cell development and is involved in gene silencing. the ICR is normally utilised by the cell as s switch to permanently inactivate thanscription, thus allowing mono-allelic of a gene to control gene dosage. Preservation of the ICR metylation sttus in all subsequent daughter cells is mediated by the maintenance methylylase DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1).</p>
<p>The methylation of the paternal allele ICR blocks a transcription factor from binding and this allows downstream enhancers to activate the IGF2 promoter.resulting in normal paternal dosage.</p>
<p>Lack of methylayion of maternal ICR allows the transcription factor (CCCTC -binding factor) ti bind to the maternal ICRcreating a physical barrier blocking enhancers and preventing their acces to IGF2 promoter regions. This effectively silences the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In tumors with loss of impring the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. LOI of H19 on the maternal chromosome, when it occurs, could occur independently or could be influenced by events in the paternal chromosome. This then gives the a double dose of growth factors and is ewvident in wilms' tum</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitbine is a Cytosine analogue,it is a DNA methyltranferse(DNMT) inhibitor and have shown to be effective in reactivating epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The DNMT enzyme catalyses the addition a methyl group to via a cytosine nucleoside. The Decitabine is incorporated in the DNA then replaces irreversibly the cytosine that binds to the DNMT . This cause the enzyme to degrade thus reducing the amount og cellular DNMT and thus the amount of methylation  and silincing.</p>
<div dir="ltr">Decitabine produces antitumor effects by specifically targeting DNA methyltransfer</div>
<div dir="ltr">ases (DNMTs) that maintain the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes and contribute to the progression of cancers.</div>
<div dir="ltr">This results in re-expression of silenced genes that can inhibit cellular proliferation, induce differentiation or induce apoptos</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic modifications are widely accepted as playing a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and thereby contributing   to the determination of the phenotype of multicellular organisms. In general, these marks are cleared and re-established each  generation, but there have been reports in a number of model organisms that at some loci in the genome this clearing is incomplete.This phenomenon is referred to as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Moreover, recent evidence shows that the environment can stably influence the establishment of the epigenome. Together, these findings suggest that an environmental event in one generation could affect the phenotype in subsequent generations</p>
<p>Sensitive periods refers to the periods in development where there is removal and re-laying of epigentics marks in the genome. these are evident by the decrease of DNA methylation during these periods.</p>
<p>The two major sentive perods are</p>
<ol><li>Primodial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm.</li>
<li>The zygote formation through to the early post implantation period.</li>
</ol><p>However there are sensitive poeriods during somatic maintenance. These may occur during specifoc tissue differentiaion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any epigenitic marks prduced by the treatmemnt may be removed and not reestablished or abarrently reestablised.</p></div>
