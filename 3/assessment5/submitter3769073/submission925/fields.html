    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation, the process of altering the expression of genes - therefore leading to cell differentiation - is altered in cancer in three specific parts of the gene: In the CpG islands, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements. <br /><br />In the normal gene, groups of cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in the 5' regulatory regions of genes known as CpG islands usually stay unmethylated. The reason for this is that methylation in those areas usually leads to silencing of those coding genes (which contain many tumour-suppressor genes). In the case of cancer, these very sites are hypermethylated. This leads to silencing of certain tumour-supressor genes, and therefore, allows tumours to grow uninhibited.<br /><br />DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is mainly used to control RNA transcription and allow for only the select proteins to be made at the time without exhausting nutrients unefficiently. It also maintians genomic stablity, not allowing for deletions, insertions, duplications, and translocation between chromosomes. It silences unneeded splice sites, and prevents transcriptional interference (which leads to loss of genomic integrity). <br />So, it is no surprise that HYPOmethylation of these parts of the gene is the feature most found in cancers studied, as increased unmethylation of these unstable parts of the gene cause an increased number of insertions, duplications, etc. This genomic instability almost certainly leads to the formation of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal paternal allele, the H19/Igf2 cluster is usually methylated. Keeping in mind that methylation in Imprint Control Regions do not necessarily mean silencing of that region, the ICR in the paternal allele is methylated -- which prevents an insulator protein known as CTCF from binding to the ICR. This prevention means that the preferred region of activation, Igf2, is free to be accessed by the enhancers further down the gene, allowing for Igf2 to be activated. <br /><br />In the normal maternal allele, the opposite occurs. The ICR is NOT methylated, allowing CTCF to bind and prevent access to Igf2. Therefore, the enhancers activate the second region of preferred choice: H19. Igf2 is not expressed.<br />Imprinting is disrupted by translocation and mutation in the maternal allele.<br />Igf2 is a growth promoting region. When imprinting is disrupted, the maternal allele acts just like the paternal allele, leading to more Igf2 being expressed and no Cdkn1c (growth suppressor gene) being expressed. This leads to tumour development, and eventually cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor. It can decrease hypermethylation, or demethylate certain areas on the gene. This reverse change, demethylation, can slow down tumours by allowing tumour supressor genes to be expressed after it was silenced by hypermethylation, the usual precursor to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation can last longer than expected on the epigenome as these epigenetic changes are passed through cell division until they are actively erased. Decitabine has been shown in studies, after cellular uptake, to become incorporated into the DNA.<br /><br />A sensitive period is when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.<br />There are two sensitive periods: one between primodrial germ cell development and mature sperm and eggs, and the other between pre-implantation and post implantation, till the epiblast.</p>
<p>In these periods, active removal of epigenetic marks and laying down of new ones take place. These periods are when the epigenome seems most vulnerable to changes in the environment. Even miniscule changes such as changes in diet could affect it as well.</p></div>
