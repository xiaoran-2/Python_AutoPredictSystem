    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer by being more common in specific loci but less common across the whole genome. In normally functioning cells there is rarely DNA methylation of CpG islands. Where CpG islands are methylated this leads to silencing of gene expression. By contrast, cancerous cells are more likely to contain methlyated CpG islands. This can result in silencing of tumour suppressor genes and this inactivity is passed down to daughter cells during division as DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. As cancer cells divide very rapidly, this CpG island hypermethylation spreads quickly over time and enables a tumour to grow bigger.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated in normal cells and this ensures stability across the genome. Specifically, DNA methylation in intergenic regions silences cryptic transcription and splice sites, and prevents promoter expression that wants to go in opposing directions from colliding. DNA methylation in repetitive elements performs similar fuctions but by silencing these repeats it ensures that they cannot jump around the genome as well as protecting against interference from the expression of nearby genes.In cancer the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to lack DNA methylation and this hypomethylation results in genomic instability as these area become active. This activation can lead to repeats moving around the genome and inserting themselves in different locations, illegitimate recombinations of DNA strands, and disruptions to nearby genes as cryptic promoters are no longer silenced. Consequently, genetic mutations can occur through deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations all of which commonly occur in tumours and increase over time as the cancer progresses.</p>
<p>However, DNA methylation's impact is context dependent as some tumour types are driven by hypermethylation while others by reductions in DNA methylation and this can depend on the stage of tumour development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disrupted imprinting involves both maternal and paternal alleles being silenced or expressed through hypermethylation or hypomethylation at the imprint control regions (ICRs). This disruption can result in genes that promote growth being expressed more while genes that restrict growth become inactive thus faciliating tumour development and growth.</p>
<p>Normally imprinted genes should have monoallelic gene expression. For example, in the H19/lgf2 cluster the paternal allele normally has a methylated ICR preventing binding of CTCF to lgf2 and allowing enhancers to increase expression of lgf2 while H19 is silenced. Whereas, the ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to lgf2 and prevent enhancers from acting on it so lgf2 is not expressed on this allele but H19 is. In Wilm's tumour the maternal allele is methylated along with the paternal allele and therefore there is twice as much expression of lgf2 because on the maternal allele lgf2 is no longer insulated by CTCF and H19 becomes silenced thus the enhancers act upon lgf2 instead and enable its expression. This loss of imprinting results in an excess of lgf2 and subsequently over-growth in fetal and post-natal periods and promotion of kidney tumour growth in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug approved by the FDA to treat myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to acute myelomonocytic leukemia. It is a DNMT inhibitor which prevents DNA methylation from being passed down to daughter cells during mitosis. Decitabine comprises an analogue of a nucleoside which binds to DNMTs during replication when the DNMTs are incoporated into DNA. It remains bound to the DNMT and cannot be removed. Therefore, in subsequent cell divisions it continues to block DNMT action and thus DNA methylation cannot be inherited by the daughter cells. The impact of Decitabine is greatest in cancer cells as they rapidly replicate. Decitabine is particularly effective in blood-related tumours and this may be because such tumours are driven by hypernethlyation of tumour suppressor genes and by inhibiting the spread of DNA methylation Decitabine is thus preventing the formation or growth of this type of cancer (suppressing tumorigenesis).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Within somatic cells, DNA methylation is mitotically inherited - that is it is passed down to daughter cells through the action of DNMT1 during mitosis. This process continues throughout the lifecycle to maintain cell identity unless a stochastic or external event causes demethylation. Therefore, drugs that alter DNA methylation can continue to exert their effects long after the drug has been stopped. A sensitive period refers to a period in (early) development when the epigenome is particularly vulnerable to environmental effects because it is undergoing alterations in epigenetic control and thus more open to external influence. This can be contrasted with later somatic maintenance when there is less opportunity to alter existing epigenetic marks. Sensitive periods include early development (gametes to epiblast - embryogenesis) and then primordial germ cell development (gametogenesis) when there is active reprogramming of epigenetic marks. However, the precise timing of the sensitive period is organ dependent. As 'epigenetic drugs' constitute a major environmental insult then it is inadvisable to use them during sensitive periods as they could impair normal cell differentiation and functioning, disrupt imprinting and increase risk of disease, result in genetic mutations/silencing and related disorders, shorten life and pass on detrimental effects to future generations.</p></div>
