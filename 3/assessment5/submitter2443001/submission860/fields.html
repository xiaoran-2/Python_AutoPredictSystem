    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal (non-oncogenic) DNA, methylation at CpG islands occur in the promoters of many genes. They are usually unmethylated, and this allows proper transcription of the genes. In cancer cells, CpG islands can become heavily methylated, which can disrupt the transcription of tumor suppressor genes, causing disregulation of the cell's normal processes, and leading to uncontrolled proliferation. </p>
<p>Normal DNA is more commonly methylated at intergenic regions of repetitive elements. This allows these regions to be tightly bundled up into heterochromatin, which prevents unnecessary transcription factor binding, in the case of intergenic regions, and improper recombination, in the case of repetitive elements. If these regions become hypomethylated, as in cancer, then inappropriate recombination can cause widespread genomic disruption and mutation. These mutations then can cause further cell disregulation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, supressing expression of H19 and leading to expression of Igf2. In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated, and CTCF binds to it and activated H19. Igf2 is inactive. In cancer, the imprinting of the IGR is disrupted, and both alleles are methylated, as in a normal paternal allele. This causes overexpression of Igf2, and drives cellular proliferation (and thus cancer). </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a methyltransferase inhibitor, so it prevents DNA from being hyper-methylated, as in the case of CpG islands in tumors. When patients are treated with Decitabine, the over methylation phenotype is reversed, and tumor suppressor activity may rebound from its very low levels. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be passed on during DNA replication (mitotic heritability). This is because the presence of a methylated CpG causes the methylation of the new, complementary strand being laid down during replication. Similarly, removing methylation at these points prevents the methylation from being replicated. </p>
<p>A sensitive period is a part of an organism's life cycle during which epigenetic marks are laid down or removed, after which they become much harder to alter. The sensative periods of development are during the devolopment of primordial germ cells and during feotal development. Treating patients during these periods could alter very important patterns of epigenetic marks that are important in determining the functions of various cell and tissue types. </p></div>
