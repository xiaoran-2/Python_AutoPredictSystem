    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal genome different regions are differentially methylated. A special region is e.g. the CpG island. CpG islands are regions where the CpG-dinucleotids are highly frequented. They are not methylated in a normal and healthy cell. They are used to regulate the expression of genes. When the CpG islands are unmethylated, the gene which lies downstream is expressed. In a cancer cell, the CpG islands are methylated, and so the genes are not expressed. The CpG island hypermethylation appears often in cancer cells to inactivate tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated in a healthy cell to silence these regions, which encode no genes. In cancer cells the intergenetic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. This local hypomethylation can lead to an activation of destructive DNA-elements and a destabilization of the genome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting means that the expression of genes can be dependent on the parent of origin. The alleles of the parents are differentially methylated.</p>
<p>The <em>H19/lgf2 </em>cluster is a good example. There are enhancers in this cluster downstream of the genes which affect the maternally expressed <em>H19</em> and the paternally expressed <em>lgf2</em>. The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR (imprinting control regions). That prevents the binding of CTCF (insulator protein) and leads to the methylation and silencing of the <em>H19</em> promotor. The enhancers are able to interact with <em>lgf2</em> and it can be expressed. On the other hand the maternal allele is not methylated on the ICR. Therefore CTCF can bind and generate an insulator, so <em>lgf2</em> cannot be enhanced in its expression. But the <em>H19</em> promotor is enhanced and therefore <em>H19</em> is expressed.</p>
<p>When the ICRs are hypermethylated, the imprinting gets lost. Both alleles, maternal and paternal, express <em>lgf2</em> but no <em>H19</em>. This overexpression of <em>lgf2</em>, which is an oncogene and promotes growth, leads to the Wilm’s tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are some drugs which can be helpful in the treatment of diseases which are results of epigenetic regulation. E.g. Decitabine is already on the market. It is a DNA demethylating agent and is sold as Dacogen by Eisai. It is a cytosine analogue and blocks DNTM (DNA methyltransferase), leading to its degradation. So there are less DNTM which can lay down methylations. Hypermethylation can induce tumors through silencing of tumor suppressor genes. If there is less methylation, there are more active tumor suppressor genes. Decitabine is FDA-approved to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a preleukemic bone morrow disorder.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The alteration of DNA methylation is a very lasting way. The treatment is still an influenced variable long after the drug treatment. The DNA methylation is actively remodeled during differentiation. In the normal and differentiated cell the epigenetic marks are not changed and so the changes in the DNA methylation which were triggered by the drug are present until the cell undergoes apoptosis.</p>
<p>But not in every cell is every region on the DNA strands open and accessible for the altering of epigenetic marks. Only in a sensitive period every epigenetic mark is reprogrammed. But the altering of DNA methylation or another epigenetic mark in a sensitive period is not recommended. Sensitive periods are the primordial germ cell development and the pre-implantation period, the early development. Then epigenetic reprogramming takes place and the genome gets demethylated and methylated again. If there are less DNTM in resetting of DNA methylation, the epigenetic reprogramming is severely affected. E.g. repeats and intergenetic regions would not be methylated and this can lead to an activation of destructive DNA-elements and a destabilization of the genome.</p>
