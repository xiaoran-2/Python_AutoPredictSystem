    <div class="field-value"><p>When promoter regions of genes are highly methylated, the gene expression tends to decrease.  The methyl groups bind with blocking enzymes to prevent RNA polymerase from attaching and allowing it to copy genetic material.  CpG islands are found in a little less than 2/3 of these promoter regions and these islands in normal cells are usually not methylated, allowing for an increase in gene expression.  In cancer cells, the CpG islands become hypermethylated and gene expression is silenced.  When this happens in tumor suppressing genes, the tumor growth can take off and the cancer progresses.  In general, methylation maintains genomic integrity by preventing illegitimate combinations or translocations of repetitive elements from different chromosomes.  Hypomethylation at intergenetic areas and repetitive elements which make up a majority of the genome is associated with cancer.   In cancer cells the hypomethylation of the repetitive and intergenic regions allows for misalignments and recombination because the chromatin is not densely packaged and is available;  repeats can jump to different locations in the genome leading to instability.  The outcome of the methylation changes are context dependent;  some tumors are more driven by hypermethylation at the promotor regions while others are more affected by the instability caused by the intergenic/repeat hypomethylation.  These dependencies may change at varying stages of the cancer. This impacts greatly when some drugs might be effective and what types of drugs might work.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because the epigenetic changes (i.e. DNA methylation) have mitotic heritability, they are passed on to the daughter cells each time a cell divides, so altering that methylation will have continued effects in the next generations of cells even though you may no longer be taking the drug.  Sensitive periods are those periods during which the epigenetic marks may be cleared so that the gamete cells may express genes for special reproductive functions and then re-established in the next generation.  This generally occurs prior to implantation of the embryo and during primordial germ cell development.  In particular, when the primordial germ cells are developing there is the potential to affect three generations by environmental changes (i.e. drugs);  therefore caution must be used during these periods in altering the epigenome due to the long lasting nature of the changes across those generations.  In addition, longer term effects may be of less concern in older individuals than in the very young, who may be more likely to live long enough (provided they survive the disease being treated for) to experience adverse consequences from these side effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Many cells which are imprinted are involved in growth, which is likely why we see similar activity in cancer cells.  In imprinted cells, genes from only one parent of origin are  expressed (this gene can be a promotor or a silencer).  When imprinting is lost,  both parental alleles will be either expressed or both will be silent.  In cancer cells loss of imprinting is often noted.  In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, in the paternal allele, the imprint control region region at H19 is hypermethylated.  This blocks binding by enhancers at the CTCF, allowing overexpression of the Igf2 cluster.  The imprint control region on the maternal allele is unmethylated, allowing the enhancers to bind with CTCF and promoting it in preference to the Igf2.  In loss of imprinting such as in  Wilm's tumor,  both the paternal and maternal allele are hypermethylated, blocking the CTCF binding of the enhancers and allowing them to bind preferentially to and promote the Igf2.  Igf2 is a growth promotor which is associated with the childhood kidney tumor seen in Wilm's disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes.  It is a nucleoside analog which works by becoming incorporated into the DNA of a cell.  When DNMT1 binds to the nucleotide, instead of making a copy it is "stuck" or irreversibly bound and no copy can be made.  Because it works by stopping replication it only works in cells which are actively dividing.  Since cancer cells are typically dividing faster than other cells in the body, they are affected more than other cells.</p></div>
