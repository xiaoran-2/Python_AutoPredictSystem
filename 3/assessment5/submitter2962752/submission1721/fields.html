    <div class="field-value"><p>Dna methylation is altered in cancer. Normally the CpGislands and shores are hypomethylated (not methyllated) allowing the genes to be expressed and the introns, intergenetic regions and the repetitive elements are hypermethylated (highly methylated) preventing them from being expressed. In cancer cells we see the opposite.</p>
<p>In connection with cancer we see locus specific hypermethylation meaning that each cancer type shows different patterns of which promoters has its/their CpG islands and shores hypermethyllated. Usually it is in promoters to tumour repressive genes. These are genes whose function is to control the action of growth genes, stop too rapid growth and repair or destroy cells that show damage or abnormal development. When such genes are silenced we see an increase in abnormal growth which in itself is not cancer but which can develop into cancer cells.</p>
<p>In cancer we also see that the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements have lost their methylation and thus are more active and unstable.  The repeats will make the genome less tightly packed and can then easily jump in and activate neighbor genes or disturb their function. They can combine in new ways and lead to deletion, insertion or translocation of parts so that expression will become different or abnormal which can contribute to cancer. This is something that the cell does not want to happen so these regions are usually very tightly packed and stable and non active in normal cells.</p>
<p>These cancer changes can happen both through mutations and epigenetic changes like methylation, and often both, enhancing each other. We can get have increased activity of a growth gene and/or its enhancer, or reduced activity of a tumour reducing gene or increased activity of its inhibitor.  Lots of research is still going on to find the details which differ for each cancer type.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell in the paternal  imprinted allele in the H19/lgf2 cluster we see that the imprinting control region is methylated, and therefore silencing H19, the long non coding RNA which blocks gene expression,  therefore allowing enhancers to work on the active lgf2 which is a growth promoter – an oncogene. The maternal allele on the other hand has an interaction between the expressed H19 and an insulator protein CTCF blocking the enhancers from acting on the preferred lgf2 which becomes inactive and instead enhances H19. This creates a balanced and controlled growth.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour cases(embryonic or childhood kidney tumour) seen in Beckwith Wiedermann syndrome this balance is disrupted. The paternal allele is the same with the lgf2 active, but now we also get methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele making both alleles similar and we get the double dose of growth. Excessive and/or uncontrolled growth is part of what is typical for cancers so we see how this disrupting of imprinting can contribute to disease.</p>
<p>Another imprinted area close by has CdKn1c which is a tumour suppressor and if that too is abnormally imprinted and less active, they together increase the risk of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (DNMTinhibitor) which is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (precursor to acute myelogenous leukaemia).  Since methylation of for example tumour repressor genes silence them, demethylating of these genes can result in the repressors being activated and then beginning to control or stop the cancer growth/development in cancers where the cancer is connected to hypermethylation of the tumour suppressor. The DNMti  work through inhibiting the enzymes that induce/increase methylation:  the DNMTs – the DNA methylatransferases.</p>
<p>These DNMTinhibitor’s can control the cancer but not stop it completely so when the patient stops using the drug the cancer will again become more active.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on though cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. Methylation is passed on by the cell duplicating and then methylating the daughter to be similar to the mother cell. This means that any altering of the DNA methylation will lead to daughter cells inheriting the same alteration in DNA methylation whether the cell is normal, cancerous or epigentically changed through drugs. This happens with GSK2816126, an inhibitor that reduces the activity of the EZH2 enzyme which is overactive in lots of lymphoma cancers and which silence tumour supressor genes. GSK2816126 therefore reduces growth of tumour cells but do not effect normal cells which just continue to pass on normal methylation to their daughter cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period where changes in the environment more easily can lead to genetic or epigenetic changes. Two developemental periods are especially sensitive to environmental influences including drugs. The first is from primordial germ cell to mature sperms and eggs, the second is in the preimplantation and the early post implantation period. Both are periods where the genome has reduced methylation and when the genome is actively reprogrammed and more open to changes and disruption of normal programming.</p></div>
