    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands generally is to repress gene expression. CpG islands that regulate gene expression are located in gene promoters, DNA methylation is repressive mark. There are exceptions from this rule, for example promoter of <em>Nanog</em>, one of key pluripotency markers in ES and iPS cells, does not have methylated CpG islands. Interestingly, it seems like CpG island methylation is the final repression mark followed after by different histone modifications.</p>
<p>In cancer cells there are two processes regarding DNA methylation: hipo- and hypermethylation. Hipomethylation occurs genome-wide and cause expression of proto-oncogenes and repetitive elements that in turn increase genome instability. Hypermethylation occurs regionally and could turn off tumor suppressor genes. One of the interesting phenomenons are CpG island shores – methylated 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands and increasing the silencing effect. Also CpG methylation can occur inside protein coding parts of the genes thus interfering with possible splicing variants and other precise gene expression regulator mechanisms.</p>
<p>DNA methylation normally represses expression of repetitive elements thus maintaining genome stability. This is one of the first events during pluripotent cell proliferation. As byproduct this methylation in ES cells effectively silence transgenes, introduced by retro- and lentiviruses. As for intergenic regions, it was shown that their methylation also increase genome stability.</p>
<p>In cancer cells we observe genome-wide hipomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. That causes genome instability – chromosomal rearrangements. There could be recombination between repeats, and oncogene reactivation due to proximity of strong promoters after chromosomal rearrangement. Another consequence could be deletion of key methylation enzymes that leads to global transcription changes and progression of cancer with selection of the most malignant cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA demethylation reagent; it is a modification of azacitidine that incorporates exclusively in DNA not in RNA. The incorporation of decitabine makes it impossible DNA methylation of CpG island as it substitutes cytidin. So if a person was given this drug there would be dose dependent genome-wide DNA hipomethylation.</p>
<p>As hypermethylation of various promoters can inhibit oncosuppressor genes in cancer cells the hipomethylation due to decitabine treatment may reverse this effect. It is also known that DNA methylation marks are maintained once they were set. It means that if we remove them there are very high chances that this new state would be maintained even in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The observation of better results of subsequent chemotherapy after decitabine treatment may also be the consequence of global genome demethylation that disrupted some pathways of gene and lncRNA expression acquired by cancer cell during its development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is maintained. That means that even if cancer cell managed to change DNA methylation status of certain regions such as oncosuppressor gene promoters, if we remove this methylation mark there are high chances that it would not be restored. </p>
<p>Sensitive period regarding DNA methylation means that there is genome-wide active or passive DNA methylation or demethylation of specific regions. Disruptions of this process will lead to massive mistakes in epigenome that in turn will impair future development as a lot of genes are “reprogrammed” in this time. Thus treatment in this period may have even cancerogenic effect and as for gametes - bad prognosis for progeny.</p>
<p>Such sensitive periods include 1) zygote-blastocyst-epiblast stages when there is global genome-wide demethylation and de novo resetting of epigenetic marks; and 2) the period when primordial germ cells are formed and gametes are developed, this period is also characterized by DNA demethylation with subsequent de novo DNA methylation. Meanwhile there are many epigenetic modifications during normal tissue development but that time is not considered as sensitive period as there are no genome-wide epigenetic modifications.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>ICR in <em>H19/Igf2</em> locus in normal cells regulates imprinted expression as follows. In maternal allele ICR is unmethylated thus CTCF binds to it and “stops” <em>Igf2</em> enhancers. Absence of <em>H19</em> promoter methylation allows its expression. In paternal allele ICR is methylated as well as H19 promoter, CTCF cannot bind to ICR. There is no <em>H19</em> expression as its promoter is methylated and <em>Igf2</em> enhancers are working as there is no CTCF at ICR.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor due to hypermethylation of ICR both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated and there is expression of Igf2 from both paternal and maternal chromosomes and no expression of H19 at all.</p>
<p><em>H19</em> locus could act as tumor suppressor in mice and probably in humans so lack of its expression is not beneficial for cell. <em>Igf2</em>, insulin growth factor 2, is expressed early in development and its second dose might promote additional growth of cells that is not normal.</p></div>
