    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation alters the gene expression pattern in cells, silencing the gene expression. DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene transcription and it´s known that genes with high levels of 5 methylcytosine in their promoter region are transcriptionally silent.</p>
<p>In cancer cases and other diseases, there are aberrant DNA methylation patterns, hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Some genes, like tumor supressor, DNA repair or other genes that involved in cell cycle regulation, could be silenced, or some other genes could be indirectly overexpressed stimulating the celular disregulation.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to avoid the movement of transposable elements. This function is disrupted in cancer and other diseases, where it is found the hypomethylation of this transposable elements (transposons or retrotransposons), letting them to move and insert to other regions with the same LTR.</p>
<p>In mouse, there is a well known example of how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease, that is the Axis fused alelle, where a truncated axin it is produced because of the “jump” of an unmethylated IAP LTR.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated which blocks the CTCF binding, and the expression of H19 is inhibited, making the enhancers to produce more quantity of Igf2. The overexpression of Igf2 is commonly shown in Wilm´s tumour.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele there is no methylation of ICR, so CTCF is able to bind to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.</p>
<p>In Wilm´s tumour the maternal allele changes as if it were a paternal allele (bipaternal epigenotype at these loci), with H19 inactive and IGF2 biallelically active.</p>
<p>If the epimutation (disrupting imprinting), is found in all the tissues,  the result is a symdrome called Beckwith- Wiedemann, contributing to more complicated diseases, and not only with Wilm´s tumour</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.</p>
<p>Decitabine has a great impact because epigenetic silencing is potentially reversible, it can reactivate epigenetically silenced genes and some drugs like this, inhibit DNA methylation and can lead to the restatement of silenced genes recovering its original function.</p>
<p>These agents are incorporated into the DNA (they are nucleoside analogs) upon replication of cells with high mitotic index irreversibly inhibiting the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and it can no longer be released and thus prevent island hypermethylation GpC.</p>
<p>The action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is division dependent so cell replicating is necessary. In cancer cells, which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severely affected because they're replicating more. Lower doses of this drug do have a very good anti-neoplastic effect, because it is able to inhibit the activity of DNMT.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Due to semiconservative duplication, during DNA replication a new unmethylated strand is produced, but to maintein methylation a DNA methyltranferase that recognizes hemimethylated chromatin is necessary. This activity makes DNA methylation heritable and long lasting.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when the environment is able to influence and remodelling the epigenetics marks, by removing them and creating a new ones (reprograming)</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods of development: the primordial germ cell development (production of mature eggs and sperms) and the early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because we are going to prevent epigenetic mark reestablishment</p></div>
