    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands which are found throughout the genome and tend to be located in areas that are related to promoter regions of genes and are typically found unmethylated.  This is thought  to allow for the easy access to the DNA so that genes may be reached by transcription machinery and regulators to be expressed in the NORMAL  state. These could also be used to turn off genes normally by methylation events in the cell as needed but,  what is found in cancer cells, these regions are highly methylated throughout the genome, to the point where it is possible to consider using this detection as a confirmation of cancerous behavior. When these regions become heavily methylated they tend to close up the genome and become prohibitive of gene regulation and transcription contributing to the disease state.  It also encourages further actions in the chromosome so that it remains condensed and inaccessible. Since many regulatory elements are important in a cell, disruption to tumor suppressor genes and other regulatory genes begin the dreadful tendency for destructive behavior of cancer.</p>
<p>    Intergenic regions are located between areas of genes and are typically found methylated in their various locations in healthy cells along with repetitive elements which are normally always methylated. In the cancer cells both of these areas often become completely reversed and become unmethylated. Suppression of these potentially dangerous  repetitive elements of the genome is very important in normal cells,  in a cancer situations where these regions  become unmethylated this causes an increasing  likelihood that these transposon style repeat elements will become active and move around in the genome causing havoc with insertions and errant promoter expression. The Intergenic regions are not as well understood how they are affected by becoming unmethylated but likely due to improper cell regulation and oncogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>[==Cdkn1c==]---/…/----[==Igf2==]------(CTFC)-------[==H19==]----[==Enhancers==]-----</p>
<p>Above:Configuration of  H19/Igf2 imprint_control_region_cluster.</p>
<p> In the paternal strand the CTFC-insulator protein region is methylated along with the promoter of H19 gene. The maternal strand does not feature methylation at the CTCF site. The way this scenario functions is that on the maternal strand CTFC is not methylated, so a  CTFC can bind, this binding blocks the behavior of the enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene and thus results in the enhancers to produce H19 long noncoding and reduced Igf2. On the Paternal strand this CTFC site is blocked by the methylation so no CTFC can bind and as such, the enhancers can easily reach the Igf2 gene and produce that gene product and not the methylated and blocked H19 gene.</p>
<p>What goes amok is when there  are  mutations or deletions that cause a loss imprinting, or most commonly there is a case of uniparental disomy in which two of the imprinted strands are present from the same parent. Wilm’s tumor is such a case with two paternally imprinted strands. This causes an overdose of IGf2(oncogene) and a loss of Cdkn1c(tumor_supressing),and together disease_state_tumors in the kidney of children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitibane belongs to a drug class of  DNA demethylating drugs. With this class of drugs, to be effective the drug must act in certain ways ,  to slow the methylation of areas in cancer patients or to remove methyls  that are related to the particular type of cancer involved. It’s  also possible that they might help indirectly  by changing some sites which do not actively affect the cancer cells,  but that then will increase the effectiveness of other cancer treating drugs. So, essentially removal of methylation groups tends  open the genome DNA up and probably allow for tumor suppressors  to become active  or other regulators to gain control of the cells growth again. With active tumor supressors being expressed again the potential to stop the tumor could be markedly increased. The marks can be passed down in cell division and allows for the potential  change in methylation to persist.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As partially explained above, DNA methylating drugs, though they may not be directly involved in  treatment of a particular cancer, are none-the-less possibly capable of making some persistent epigenetic changes that make alternative or different cancer treatments more effective. The persistence of epigenetic changes are passed down mitotically, because of this, even though the epigenetic medicine is no longer being taken, the epigenetic changes can still be effective and passed down the cell line.</p>
<p>    Treatment of epigenetic altering drugs must be handled carefully because the field is still exploring the long term effects of these medicines. During particular times in a patient’s life there are two periods that may make for a more dangerous treatment period. These correspond to the natural timing in an organism when epigenetic marks are being manipulated, cleared and laid down. epigenetic reprograming during primordial germ cell development, and in early development are times where imprinting process are probably best left alone. This is considered part of the sensitive time. Some epigenetic changes might only have an effect only in early development and minimal information exist on how that might be affected, so best to not interfere in those processes when possible.</p></div>
