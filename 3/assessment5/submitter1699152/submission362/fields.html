    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal functioning cell CpG islands are generally unmethylated while intergenic regions, repetitive elements and some introns are methylated. As a cell progresses through genetic disruption and becomes cancerous this pattern reverses.  CpG islands become hypermethylated while the intergenic regions, repetitive elements and introns become hypomethylated. </p>
<p>When CpG islands are hypermethylated this leads to transcriptional silencing which is passed on to daughter cells.  This silencing can interfer with promoters.</p>
<p>When Repetitive elements and intergenic regions become hypomethylated it causes genomic instability.  This instability leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats, activiation of repeats and transposition, activitation of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a paternal allele the imprinting control region (ICR) is normally methylated.  This methylation silences expression of suppressors.  Without these supressors the enhancers can then act on Igf2 which is a growth promoter. So Igf2 is active on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In a maternal allele the ICR is normally unmethylated.  This allows the ICR to be expressed and this suppress the enhancers.  Without these enhances the expression Igf2 is suppressed.  So in a maternal allele Igf2 is silenced/off.</p>
<p>In Wilm's Tumor the maternal allele is hypermethylated.  This hypermethylation shuts off the silencing of the enhancers.  These enhancers can then activate Igf2. This gives the baby a double dose of Igf2, a growth promoter.  This disruption of imprinting then leads to kidney tumors in unborn babies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Decitabine is part of a class of inhibitors called DNMti or DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.  In cancers there is locus specific DNA hypermethylation particularly around CpG islands. A drug like this would impact these areas of hypermethylation that are suppressing tumor suppressor genes and demethylate them.  This would allow function to return to these areas.</p>
<p>Once the hypermethylation is decreased and function restored it would stop the spread of tumors or slow their growth.  It would have a more pronounce effect on cancer cells since they replicate more frequently than normal body cells.  A benefit of a therapy like this is that once the epigentic marks are changed they will be inherited by the daughter cells.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Drugs that effect DNA methylation have lasting effects because epigenetic marks like methylation are mitotically heritable.  That means all future daughter cells would have the same marks.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being laid down in the genome.  These periods include the zygote/blastocyst period of human development and when germline cells are being created.</p>
<p>Treatment during a sensitive period is inadvisable because it could have profound effects on gene imprinting.  If a drug is designed to remove DNA methylation then imprinting and epigenetic marks may not be established properly or at all leading to possibly infertility, miscarriages, deformities, etc.  Currently treatment using these drugs are in older patients that are well past their child bearing years.</p></div>
