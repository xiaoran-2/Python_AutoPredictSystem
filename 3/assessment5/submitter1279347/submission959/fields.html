    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation(addition of -CH3 group) prevents expression of the methylated region of DNA. It can also prevent other proteins from binding onto the DNA. Methylation of DNA in a normal person, is found to be low in CpG islands, whereas it is found to be high in intergenic regions, introns and where repetitive elements are present. This allows for the CpG islands to be exposed and active, while silencing genes in repetitive elements, introns and intergenic regions.</p>
<p>CpG islands are present mostly in promoters of genes and are required to be unmethylated for expression of genes. In cancer patients, it is observed that there is hypermethylation (excessive methylation) in CpG islands- It is observed experimentally that there is an increase in methylation in CpG islands as cancer progresses through its various stages. Hypermethylation leads to silencing some crucial tumor suppressor genes, which act as regulators that prevent cell from excess growth/ rapid multiplication, two characteristics of a cancer cell (E.g. MLH1 gene promoter- colorectal cancer).</p>
<p><br />Hypomethyln is most common in repeats and intergenic regions, in cancer patients. Hypomethyln in these elements can lead to deletions, reciprocal translocations, insertions and other illegitimate recombinations. This can disrupt regular gene functionality wherever the transposition has occured, leading to genome-wide instability. In many types of cancer, there is hypomethylation of growth-enhancing genes, transposons, leading to increased cell growth and division- a hallmark of cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control regions (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 gene in normal human beings is unmethylated in the maternal allel, allowing for CTCF (an insulator protein) to bind onto this site. This prevents Igf2 expression in maternal allele. So instead of Igf2, H19 is acted on by enhancers and expressed in the maternal chromosome.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, since ICR is methylated, this prevents the binding of the CTCF protein to the ICR, allowing for the expressin of Igf2 via enhancers (H19 is not expressed becuase of spreading of methylation).</p>
<p>In Wilm's syndrome, there is hypermethylation of both maternal and paternal alleles' ICR, instead of just the paternal allele. This prevents the CTCF protein from binding in both alleles, leading to 'double-dose' expression of the Igf2 gene, a growth-promoting gene, causing cancer of kidneys for children affected by it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferse inhibitor (DNMTi), i.e., it inhibits enzymes of the DNMT family which facilitate methylation of DNA. Thus, Decitabine leads to hypomethylation of DNA (reduced methylation). Decitabine is basically a nucleoside analogue, and thus is bound at a site in the DNA. After mitiosis, when DNMT enzymes arrive where Decitabine is bound to DNA, for methylation of DNA in daughter cells, Decitabine acts by binding to DNMT enzymes irreversably, functionally inhibiting them. At low doses, this allows for lower methylation of DNA in rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells. This can address problems of hypermethylation that accompanies cancer cells, by reducing methylation to normal levels, activating otherwise silenced tumor suppressors etc. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes like DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. This implies that, the daughter cells produced after mitosis will inherit the DNA methylation pattern of the parent cell. Thus, altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the         epigenome.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is one which environmental factors have high influences on the epigenetic marks of the developing cell in a human being. There are two main sensitive periods- from Primordial germ cell development till gamete production and pre-implantation till early post-implantation. Treating patients during sensitive periods can lead to huge alterations in their epigenetic makeup, since, in these periods there is epigenetic remodelling which is highly susceptible to environmental factors including treatment, leading to undesired side-effects. </p></div>
