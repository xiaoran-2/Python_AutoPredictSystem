    <div class="field-value"><p>The <strong>DNA methylation at the CpG islands</strong> in the promoters is related to silencing gene expression. Is probable that this fact avoids the union of the TF to DNA.</p>
<p>The reaction of methylation is actively catalyzed by enzyme methyl-transferase. The process of demethylation can be active and passive, depending on whether it is catalyzed by an enzyme or product of DNA replication. The product of DNA replication is two daughter molecules DNA hemi-methylated. This is a substrate for enzymes which catalyze the methylation, in this way the methylated state of molecule returns completely. But if late of the first round of replication begins immediately other round of replication is possible that methylated state will loss.</p>
<p>In <strong>cancer</strong> are observed two phenomena related with methylation pattern, on one hand it produces <strong>wide-genome loss methylation</strong> and from the other hand it observes the <strong>local gain of methyl groups</strong> at the CpG islands in promoters. In the case of hypermethylation at CpG islands it produces silencing gene expression of tumor suppressor genes. </p>
<p>The normal function in DNA methylation in <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> is providing stability to the genome,avoiding aberrant recombination between repetitive elements. On the other hand DNA methylation in this region avoids the unnecessary transcription, which should be promoted by neighbor promoters. In the same time the methylated state in intergenic regions and repetitive elements protect to transposition.</p>
<p>Likewise, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer have likewise disrupted the normal pattern of methylation.  In normal patterns the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylized, but in cancer cells this is disrupted and is observed in the hypomethylated state. Consequences of this change of state are genomic instability and the loss of the pattern of imprinting. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal case the <strong>paternal allele</strong> is imprinted in the cluster H19/igf2, This pattern of methylation in the ICR blocks the binding of insulator to the DNA, and in the promoter of gene H19 blocks the binding of TF. The result in paternal allele is that the enhancers downstream from the Igf2 gene are able to access <em>in cis</em> in Igf2 because the insulator is unable to bind and in this way insulate the enhancers from the gene.The paternal imprinting in this case activates the expression of the Igf2 gen.</p>
<p>Contrary to the case of <strong>maternal allele</strong> which are not imprinted. In the maternal allele the protein insulator is able to bind to DNA and in this way insulates the gene Igf2 of enhancers. The result is the silencing of the gene Igf2. The gene H19 is free from methylation too. Consequence of this fact is the expression of gen H19.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Wilm’s tumor</strong> Is observed a hypermethylation in the imprinting control region of two H19/Igf2 clusters and therefore the binding of insulator protein to DNA is blocked in the two alleles. The consequence is the overexpression of the gene Igf2 because it is active in these two locations. The gene H19 is silenced by hypermethylation.     </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The drug Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which belongs to group <strong>DNMT inhibitors</strong>. It means that inhibit the enzyme DNMT avoiding DNA methylation. The chemical structure of the Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which binds to enzyme DNMT irreversibly. In this way it blocks DNA methylation by blocking the enzyme, the result is the hypomethylation of DNA.   </p>
<p>The Decitabine, by blocking DNMT, may <strong>revert abnormal epigenetic pattern of methylation in DNA</strong> through successive replications. In every DNA replication the methyl groups' concentration descend to half of the total in the original molecule, because the daughter DNA strands are hemymethyleds and it is necessary for the DNMT to reestablish and maintain the methylation pattern. If the DNMT is blocked by the drug, the hypermethylated pattern will be erased through the successive DNA replication and in this way the <strong>suppressor tumor genes will be reactive</strong>. In this fashion Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect, despite the real molecular mechanism not yet being absolutely clear.       </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The pattern of methylation is mitotically heritable, for this reason the effect of these drugs which change the methylated status of DNA will be maintained even after the period of drug treatment. </p>
<p>There exist periods of development in which it is inadvisable for the treatment with drugs which change the epigenetic pattern. These are called <strong>sensitive periods</strong> and in those periods the environment has a major influence in the epigenetic configuration.    </p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>male patient</strong> the sensitive period is around 9-12 years old and in this period of development environmental factors can have effect on the spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>In the case of the <strong>female patient</strong> the sensitive period is too in puberty around 8-10 years old in which exist the risk of affection on normal development of gametes. Therefore also pregnancy is considered a sensitive period. The first of these is very early in the pregnancy during pre-implantation and early during the post-implantation period. The second period is during primordial germ cell development in the embryo.</p>
<p>In these sensitive periods occurs the active <strong>remodeling of the epigenome</strong>. Because of this,  treatments with drugs which have an effect on the epigenome are inadvisable during the sensitive periods of development.</p></div>
