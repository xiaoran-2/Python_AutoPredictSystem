    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands is near the start of many mannalian genes where they aer involved in control of transcripition . They are many mammalian genes where they are involved in control of transcription.They are mant found at the 5'(mRNA)and end of involved involved in contiol of transcripition . They are mainly found at the 5'(mRNA) ed of the gene in the promoter region,often into the fist exon,but may occur throught the coding sequence. Restriction nuclesase Hpall cuts CCCG if the central C is unmethylated , and cuts CpG islands into small fragment in DNA from cells where a gene is active.</p>
<p>Cancerss Frequently show abnormal methlyation and loss of activity in tumor suppressor genes. Genes with a transposable element in their promoter region may have their expression modified by methlyation of the transposon.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 gene is located on human chromosome 11p15.5 and mouse chromosome on the 7th terminal region. Human H19 gene is 3489bp, including five exons and four introns. In exon 5, it has RsaⅠrestriction sites of polymorphic enzyme. H19 may be cancer suppressor. According to Wilms’ tumor, embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome loss of heterozygosity, LOH of chromosome 11p15.5, its patrilineal uniparental disomy, UPD showed biallelic expression, H19 expression was significantly low, indicated that H19 and the several tumors that mentioned was negatively correlated. Expression of H19 and classification in Histology and characteristic in biology of metastatic urothelial cancer has related. H19 did not express in highly differentiated and defensive cancer cell, but H19 expressed abundantly in strong erosion and poorly differentiated cancer cells. Loss of imprinting of H19 and become malignant in tissue of complete hydatidiform are related. On the other hand, expression of H19 in trophoblastic cancer are loss of imprinting significantly, loss of imprinting of H19 in hydatidiform and malignant predisposition are also related. Transcription of H19 transcription in two kinds of JAr and JEG-3 differentiate widely, JAr cells express high levels of H19RNA, the expression of H19 in JEG-3 cells was significantly lower than normal trophoblast cells</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine : 5 - aza-2'-deoxycytidine, is a natural 2'-deoxycytidine adenosine analogues, to inhibit the contribution of DNA methylation, so that it can reduce DNA methylation , therefore inhibiting of proliferation of tumor cells and to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance.It is possible to achieve the purpose of treatment of MDS. After Decitabine is phosphorylated, Decitabine inhibit DNA methylation in vitro, but it does not affect DNA hypomethylation. Bahar and team members reported at recently, which applicated on decitabine can reactivate genes in GADD45beta, which expressed in tumor cell. Alleman and others reported, decitabine can make transplantation of tumor cells of kidney in mice, and become significantly smaller.Miotto and others are reported, decitabine can make CDH4 tumor suppressor gene in colorectal and gastric cancer cells are re-expressed. KAWAKAMI and others’ investigation showed that decitabine can restore the expression of hMSH3 in bladder cancer, thus it affected the growth of bladder cancer.</p></div>
