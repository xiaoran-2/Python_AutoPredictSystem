    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification where a CpG island in mammals is symetrically modified by adding a methy group.  Methylation occurs from methyl transferases and because of the symmetry, dna methylation is very stable and able to be passed down from generation to generation. DNA methylation stops transcription factors from binding and tends to silence expression, but it is important to remember the silencing also can include blockers and control factors. When the promoters of tumor suppressor genes become methylated' they are silenced which often leads to the uncontrolled growth of oncongenes and cancer.  Any time a CpG island in a promoter becomes methylated, it stops expression and can lead to disease.  Normally, methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive regions silences viral regions and transposons which are undesirable when expressed.  Over time, intergenic methylation decreases which can lead to cancer and diseases by unleashing silenced sequences.  Generally, the methylation of repetitive regions was fairly constant over the normal development cycle shown in class.  In summary, DNA methylation is undesirable in the CpG islands of promoters which need to be expressed, but desirable in the vast intergenic regions and repetitive elements which contain viruses and transposons.  Changes over time in either can lead to disease and cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting  affects about 150 genes usually in the brain and placenta.  Instead of two chromsome expressing alleles, usually one is silenced and the other expressed to control the dosage of expression.  In this case, the paternal allele is methylated; a long non-codinbg RNA called H19 is expressed which silences the blocker CTCF and causes the growth gene Igf2 to be expressed.  The maternal allele is not methylated, the long non-coding RNA H19 is expressed, the blocker is activated and the growth gene Igf2 is not expressed.  Because of paternal imprinting or methylation, only the paternal allele expresses growth and the maternal allele is inactive, yielding the correct dosage. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal allele is also methylated or imprinted so both the maternal and paternal Igf2 contribute to growth, usually resulting in cancer.    The other case is where neither allele is methylated and H19 blocks growth on both.  This example shows imprinting is a tool to control growth in fetuses.  Too much imprinting can cause cancer; too little can cause disease and death.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of a family of DNA-demethylating agents.  The article mentions that many cancers occur when enzymes like EZH2 become overactive and start methylating and turning off tumor suppressor genes.  Decitabine restricts methylation of DNA and histones.  In some of the tests of lymphome and lung cancer, patients who took Decitabine showed slower tumor growth while healthy cells were not effected.  Decitabine is an effort to restrict methylation when it is over active and the cause of cancer.  A basic assumption of this drug is that methylation of tumor suppression genes is bad and that a de-methylating agent can turn the tumor-suppressing genes back on without affecting the rest of the epigenome.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation status is heritable beause it is symetric on both DNA strands.  When you change the methylation status, it will be passed on. The drugs that affect the epigenome would pass these  effects on; however, the process is quite complicated in that you only want to change certain markings in the genome.  Mistakes in DNA methylation were earlier shown in the imprinting section to result in either slow growth and disease or too much growth and cancer.   Early development and primordial germ cells are sensitive periods for epigentics where most of the epigentics marks  are removed to allow rapid growth and differentiation and then later added back on.  During these periods, organisms are sensitive to environmental, nutritional and maternal care influences which could affect the coorect epigenetic markings.  After development, the epigentic marks are then added and maintained and are not as sensitive.  Treating patients during the sensitive period is inadvisable in that most of the epigentic marks are gone and there is more opportunity for error.  During these periods, most of the epigentic marks are removed, and the drugs could result in massive changes to the epigenome.  During the maintenance periods, smaller changes to the epigenome can be observed and corrected.   </p></div>
