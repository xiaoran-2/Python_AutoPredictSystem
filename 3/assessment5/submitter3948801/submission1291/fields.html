    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the major messups in cancer. The problems with DNA methlyation in cancer are often found at CpG islands. CpG islands are basically massive promoters for a section of genes. If the genes under the CpG island need to be expressed, the CpG island promoter is left unmethylated. Likewise, I CpG island that needs silencing with be methylated. In cancer, it is observed that there is massive hypermethylation of CpG islands. This means that lots of CpG islands are methylated. This effects the genes that are supposed to be expressed, namely tumor growth suppressors. One of the main attributes of cancer is its ability to grow and by silencing tumor growth suppressors, abnormal growth can be achieved. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements, on the other hand, are usually methylated. When cancer develops these regions are often unmethylated through hypomethylation. This affects how these useless regions are expressed. even though they don't need to be expressed because of their lack of genes, they are still transcripted and translated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a paternally imprinted gene, with the ICR on the paternal strand methylated and the the ICR on the maternal strand unmethylated. Because the maternal strand is unmethylated, a suppressor enzyme can bind to it. This suppressor enzyme stops enhancers from reaching the gene, therefore keeping the gene silent. On the paternal strand, the ICR is methylated so the suppressor enzyme cannot bind to it. This allows the enhancer to reach the gene and activate it. This is disrupted in some diseases including Wilm's tumor. One way this happens is through both alleles acting like the paternal allele. This has a multitude of effects, one of them being desttryoying the tight relationship between Kcnq1 and Igf2, an oncogene and a tumor growth supressor. Tipping the scale towards the oncogene causes abnormal growth, a comon characteristic of cancer. The H19/Igf2 cluster is paternally expressed, but with mutations to it, can cause many forms of disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, used to treat leukemia. It does this by first treating <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, the beginning steps of <span>myelodysplastic leukemia. Decitabine protects from this form of cancer because it more or less reinstates DNA methylation back to normal. It takes away the methylation (most importantly from the tumor growth suppressor) and stops cancer from growing rapidly. This is a very big breakthrough because demethylating drugs are new to science and are seeming to work well.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering the normal DNA methylation in a cell can have lasting effects because its dealing with the epigenome. Epigenetics is responsible for activating and silencing genes and if it is changed, it is different from the norm. The effects are most disastrous in "sensitive periods." Sensitive periods are certain periods in development that are places where epigenetic marks are erased and reinstated after. There are two sensitive periods, the preimplantation stage and the primordial germ cell stageboth in early development. Its pretty clear why effects on DNA methylation are most costly during then because a change in the epigenetics when its resetting can have effects for the entire life of the organism. </p></div>
