    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are frequently located in the promoter regions of  thousands of genes and are typically unmethylated which maintain the possibility of gene expression open. This also makes them less susceptible to mutations.</p>
<p>In most cancer cells, the promoter-associated CpG islands are hypermethylated. The genes affected are therefore silenced. This can contribute to the progression of cancer cells. Genes that has been involved in this inactivation mechanism  includes tumour suppressor, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, DNA repair genes, transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, apoptosis mediators, nuclear receptors and many others.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements and Intergenic regions are normally methylated in normal cells. The function of DNA methylation at intergenic regions is believed that can contribute to genomic integrity since Dnmt1 null cells (lack enzyme responsible for maintaining DNA methylation) display genomic instability. This methylation could silence cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites that would generated abnormal expressed proteins.</p>
<p>The function of DNA methylation at repetitive elements is also believe to maintain genomic integrity by:</p>
<p>                        –  silencing of repeats to prevent transposition</p>
<p>                       –  mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition</p>
<p>                        –  silencing of repeats, so avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters</p>
<p>                        –  methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination</p>
<p>In Cancer cells there is a genome wide hypomethyilation that affects repetitive elements and intergenic regions with the increase of genetic instability. As a result of this genetic instability, in cancer cells, we could find:</p>
<p>                        –  Illegitimate recombination between repeats</p>
<p>                        –  Activation of repeats and transposition    </p>
<p>                        – Activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes</p>
<p>Cancer cells, frequently have abnormal karyotypes, deletions, reciprocal translocation and insertions, due to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells we can find loss of imprinting by two mechanisms. Locus specific DNA hypermethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs) and genome-wide DNA hypomethylation of ICRs. This loss of imprinting can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes  and/or overexpression of growth promoting genes contributing to the progression of cancer cells.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster in human chromosome 11 DNA methylation acts as an enhancer blocking.</p>
<p>In the maternal chromosome the ICR is not methylated and CTCF which is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This renders the expression of the H19 gene and the no expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In the paternal chromosome the DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence and the downstream enhancers can access Igf2 to activate it. This gives no expression of H19 and expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is a hypermethylation of the ICR with loss of imprinting. This causes that the maternal chromosome behaves like the paternal one. There would be no binding of CTCF, with no enhancer blocking and the consequent overexpression of Igf2 which would promote growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has been approved by The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine (5-aza-20 -deoxy- cytidine, Dacogen), belongs to the DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTi) drugs.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a deoxyribose nucleoside analog that exert its effect by becoming incorporated into DNA, and inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) by forming covalent bounds with the enzyme, leading to its sequestration and cellular depletion. As a result of reduced DNMT activity during subsequent cell division cytosine methylation is reduced in newly replicated DNA, but not in the DNA of resting or non-dividing cells. In addition, Decitabine has been shown to induce depletion of DNMT1 through proteosomal degradation.</p>
<p>The anti-tumour effect has been studied in cell line models proving to effect methylation and to reactivate epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes. Decitabine also induces reexpression of genes known to mediate drug response.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically transmitted and therefore its effects can last beyond the period of drug treatment. A change in the DNA methylation in a cancer cell would be pass to its daughter cells, if this change results in a more susceptibility to a chemotherapeutic drug, this effect can be seen after the first epigenetic treatment was applied and could explain Dr Baylin’s findings.</p>
<p>Epigenetically speaking, sensitive periods are periods of development that are susceptible to environmental signals. These are periods of epigenetic reprogramming where epigenetic marks are established rather than maintained.</p>
<p>In mammals there are two sensitive periods, pre-implantation development and primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm.</p>
<p>Since epigenetic marks may be transmitted transgenerationally, so any treatment that affects the epigenome may have multi-generational effects. This would contraindicate using these drugs in sensitive periods such as pregnancy (early fetal development) and young children before the start of puberty  (germ cell development), ages of 9-12 for boys and 8–10 years for girls, when environmental factors have a larger impact on the body based on the Överkalix study. Furthermore, I would advised men not to try to conceive during a period after the treatment.</p></div>
