    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to Cytoseine or Adenine molecule s the DNA of living cells and is an active process.</p>
<p>CpG islands are regions of the genome which are present in the regulatory sequences (transcription sites) of many genes. Normally, these CpG islands remain hypomethylated and the following sequences (including intergenic regions and repetitive elements) are methylated. </p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands is often seen in cancers, in association with hypomethylaion of accompanying genes.</p>
<p>This is in effect the opposite of what is seen in healthy cells, and can lead to disruption of normal cell activity by decreasing activity of regulator genes (such as tumour suppressor genes) and promoting potential oncogenes.</p>
<p>This situation is observable in breast cancer where the BRCA1 gene is involved. </p>
<p>Increased DNa methylation in CpG islands with can lead to reduced expression of cancer-suppressing genes; when coupled with hypomethylation of genes which are normally hypermethylated.</p>
<p>One example is hypermethylation of the CpG island associated with the MLH1 gene which is linked to some colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>These are thought to be some of the 'hits' required by the Knudsen hypothesis. </p>
<p>Normally, intergenic regions of the genome are silenced to maintain genomic stability. If they become active, and area between two active genes could be transcribed anti-sense and cause translational disruption as the two RNA polymerase II molecules come into close proximity.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are potentially damaging to the health of the organism when active as they may transpose into different areas, and methylating these regions may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is where one allele is expressed based on parental origin.</p>
<p>H19/IGF2 cluster is found on human chromosome 11, the intergenomic control region found inbetween the IGF2 and H19 genes is unmethyated on maternal allele, methylated on the paternal allele (paternally imprinted).</p>
<p> CTFC binds to the ICR and insulates the IGF2 gene from downstream enhancers, so H19 is expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>The enhancers prefer to bind to IGF2 by looping the chromosome shape, but this blocked by the presence of CTFC and so the enhancers bind here, promoting H19 expression. On the paternal allele, the methylation spreads into the H19 promotor by progressive formation of heterochromatin. CTFC cannot bind to the methylated ICR region and so IGF2 is transcribed.</p>
<p>Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is caused by loss of maternal allele causes increased IGF2 and retards Cdkn1c. </p>
<p>This uniparental disomy, where 2 copies are inherited from the father and none from the mother, causes loss of imprinting, and so H19 is not expressed but IGF2 is expressed from both alleles, which has a growth-promoting effect.</p>
<p>No cdknc1 expression causes overgrowth in post-natal development, predisposition to embryonic/childhood tumours i.e. Wilm's tumour h <span>the kidneys.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-Demethylating agents, of which Dectibine is an example that is used to treat some forms of cancer,  are compounds that can inhibit methylation, resulting in the expression of hypermethylated genes.</p>
<p> These compounds work by binding to DNA methyltransferases, and reducing the number of methyl groups that are attatched.</p>
<p> This can have a positive anti-cancer effect by turning back on genes which have been incorrectly silenced by hypermethylation, such as genes which control potential oncogenes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have long-lasting effects as the epigenetic changes can be inherited by any daughter cells (ie it is mitotically heritable).</p>
<p>this can potentially mean epigenetics can work as a pre-treatment by removing epigenetic changes which cause and ploriforate a disease (such as cancer) making it much more likely to respond to further traditional treatments such as chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Medicines which alter levels of DNa methylation will not simply stop working as soon as the drug has stoppped being administered as the changes can be (semi-)permanant on their actions in the genome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods of epigentic development are times when the DNA is undergrowing great bursts of genetic change and occur in early the emryoic stage and later in the formation of gametes.</p>
<p>Any treatment which involves epigentic changes would be best to avoid these sensitive areas as the effects can be lasting for that organims lifespan and potentially cause changes in future generations.</p></div>
