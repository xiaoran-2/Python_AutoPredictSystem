    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally CpG islands are unmethylated, but when they are methylated (e.g. inactive X chromosome) this leads to silencing of gene expression by several mechanisme. One is through methylation binding proteins (MeCP1 and 2) that bind to <sup>me</sup>CpG and repress transcription as well as recruit factors that condense chromatin. Additionally, <sup>me</sup>CpG inhibit binding of some transcription factors</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are hypermethylated. It is progressive and increases with time. A tumor suppressor gene normally stops uncontrolled cell growth and suppresses cancer and therefore when silenced or inactivated it leads to development of cancer. This could be one of the hits contributing to cancer (Knudson Hypothesis)</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions maintains genomic stability and can silence cryptic transcription sites and cryptic splice sites. In repetitive elements, it also maintains genomic stability by protecting against transposable elements by several ways such as: silencing repeats, mutating repeats, and preventing recombination between non-identical chromosomes</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to activating transposable elements, allowing illegitimate recombination, and activating cryptic promoters and disrupting neighboring genes, hence contribute to cancer by causing genome instability</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, no insulator binding, therefore allowing enhancers to act on Igf2 and promote its expression. Methylation at ICR spreads to H19 and prevents its expression</p>
<p>In the maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated allowing for an insulator protein (CTCF) to bind to it, hence insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. This leads to silencing of Igf2 and preventing its expression and allows for expression of H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumor there is hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele promoting expression of Igf2. Therefore, Igf2 is expressed on both maternal and paternal alleles instead of paternal only leading to double the dose of Igf2 action</p>
<p>It contributes to the disease through promoting growth (Igf2 is a growth promoter)</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Methyltransferase inhibitor which leads to DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>Being a nucleoside analogue, during replication, it gets incorporated to DNA, binds irreversibly to DNA methyltransferase and causes DNA hypomethylation. Consequently, hypermethylated (silenced) genes (e.g. tumor suppressors) in cancer can gain their function.</p>
<p>It is replication dependant and exerts a bigger effect on cells that divide rapidly such as cancer cells</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because of the fact that epigenetic changes are inherited and pass from one cell to another during cell division i.e. to daughter and grand-daughter cells. Additionally, these drugs are non specific and this contributes to the long lasting effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period when altered environments have an effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods are: Period from primordial germ cell development till production of gametes (Germ cell development) and Pre-implantation and early post implantation period (Early embryonic cell development).</p>
<p>These are periods of active reprogramming and it’s inadvisable to treat patients during those periods so as not to inhibit the whole epigenetic machinery</p>
