    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually found at the promoters of genes. DNA methylation of CpG islands normally represses the expression of that gene. DNA methylation at CpG islands during cancer is overexpressed, and therefore causes the silincing of many genes. This contributes to disease depending on which CpG islands are methylated. For example, if a tumor suppressor gene is methylated at it's CpG island promoter, it won't be expressed, causing tumors to form and survive easier. Normally, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements within the genome are methylated to avoid the overexpression of repeated genes and to maintain genomic stability. During cancer, the intergenic and repetitve elements within the genome are hypomethylated. This has varying consequences depending on the location within the genome. Overall, hypomethylation of intergenic regions causes genomic instability. There could be illegitimate recombinations between repeats, these repeats could be activated and overexpressed, or even transposed to another locus within the genome. There also could be additional deletions within the genome due to the open state of the heterochromatin. This genomic instability can enhance tumorogenesis by the overexpression of growth promoting genes, the deletion of tumor suppressing genes, or the retargetting of genes to different proteins. Also, the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can cause the overexpression of an oncogene, by definition contributing to the formation and development cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinted genes can have detrimental effects within the genome. In the H19/Igf2 example the maternal allele had it's ICR unmethylated. This attracts an insulator protein, CTCF to bind to the unmethylated region. This protein blocks downstream enhancers from activating Igf2 causing the gene to be unexpressed. The paternal allele is methylated at the H19/Igf2 ICR. CTCF is unable to bind to the methylated ICR, therefore the downstream enhancers are able to activate the expression of the growth gene Icr2. In cases such as Wilm's tumor, the H19/Igf2 ICR is methylated on both the maternal and paternal alleles. This causes the overexpression of the groth gene Igf2, resulting in tumorogenesis in the kidney. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can also cause other growth disorders such as pre- and post-natal overgrowth. Microglossia, or large tongue, can be caused by disrupting imprinting as well as a predisposition to embryonic and childhood tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine may be able to open up closed heterochromatin relating to certain cancers. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. This means that it removes methylation within the genome. In cancer, the CpG island promoters of tumor suppressing or growth suppressing genes are usually hypermethylated. This causes them to be unexpressed and allows for easier tumorogenesis. Decitabine could unmethylate these CpG island promoters thereby promoting the expression of tumor suppressing or growth suppressing genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation could have long lasting effects on the epigenome, perhaps for as long as a lifetime. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable due to DNMT1.Therefore, a change in the DNA methylation pattern of an allele would be maintained until further epigenetic modifications caused otherwise. A sensitive period in development is a period when the genome is especially vulnerable to the environment. In human development, sensitive periods are pre-implantation as a zygote and during primordial germ cell development. During these sensitive periods, our chromatin is unmethylated and especially open. Treating a patient epigenetically while they were at a state of open chromatin could have a wide range of effects to the genome. Due to the open state of the chromatin, this would leave much more genetic material exposed for mutations or epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic treatment during a sensitive period would affect more of the genome than intended. </p></div>
