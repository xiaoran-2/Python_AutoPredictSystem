    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs along the whole genome, and its disruption is a typical feature of cancer. In normal cells, typical CpG islands and CpG island shores are entirely unmethylated at all stages of development, allowing gene transcription if the appropriate transcription factors are present and the chromatin structure is accessible. In addition to this, methylation of repetitive sequences and long interspersed nuclear elements which prevents genomic instability and transcription initiation are also observed in normal cells. Moreover, transposable elements cannot be activated in a methylated environment. In cancer cells, by contrast, both the CpG island and CpG island shores are heavily methylated however, the gene bodies (which includes intergenic regions and repetitive sequences) lack this kind of modification. As a result, transcription of many genes gets blocked, and abberrant transcription may occur from incorrect transcription start sites. In addition to this, global hypomethylation of the intrergenic regions and repetitive sequence triggers genomic instability, activation of latent retrotransposons and abberrant transcription initiations. Concomitant activation of transposons in the genome may either result to disruption of expression of adjacent genes which will contribute to formation of cancer cells as well as abberrant transcriptional activation of oncogenes (<em>cMYC</em> and <em>H-RAS</em>) causing abnormal cell features found in some types of cancer like urinary bladder cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Loss of imprinting involves a process wherein the silenced allele of imprinted genes becomes activated during tumorigenesis such that biallelic expression of the gene, and excess gene products, are established. In normal cells, <em>Igf2</em> is expressed from the paternal allele while <em>H19</em> is expressed in the maternal allele. The imprint control region (ICR) is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. The insulator protein (CTCF) will bind in the maternal unmethylated ICR which will insulates <em>Igf2</em> from downstream enhancers. This will allow the expression of <em>H19</em> gene which is a long non-coding RNA . On the other hand, in the paternal allele, since the ICR in this allele is methylated, CTCF cannot bind in it. This will allow the enhancers to freely act and promote expression of <em>Igf2</em> gene instead of <em>H19</em>. In Wilm's tumor where there is loss of imprinting, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the <em>H19</em> promoter, <em>Igf2</em> turned on and <em>H19</em> turned off. This will allow double dose expression of <em>Igf2</em> which possess a growth promoting activity causing increased cell growth and are associated with formation of tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) is one of the commonly used drugs targetting methylation. this drug belongs to the class called the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. This demethylating agent is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation. Studies showed that after cellular uptake and phosphorylation, decitabine is incorporated in the DNA, where it supresses the DNA synthesis and has cytotoxic effects. Once inside the cell, decitabine is then converted to become 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine diphosphate  through the action of deoxycytidine kinase and subsequent phosphorylation, the triphosphate form is incorporated into DNA in place of the natural base cytosine. Because of the substitution, the DNMT's are trapped on the subtituted DNA strand and thus methylation is inhibited (formation of hemimethylated DNA). Another round of DNA synthesis in the presence of this drug results in full double-stranded DNA demethylation and thus death of abnormal cells like tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation was identified to have two major important enduring effects in epigenome of an organism. They invole supression of gene expression and maintenance of genome integrity by supression of repetitive elements and heterochromatin. Altering the methylation pattern of a normal cell will result to abnormal transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome such as the repetitive sequences that may have transposons inserted to such sequences. Sensitive periods pertain to stages in the life cycle where there is active remodelling in an organism's whole genome. In these stages, there is active removal and laying down of epigenetic marks in the genome and are said to be very sensitive to changes in the environment. Sensitive periods in life cycle development includes: a) the period of primordial germ cell development towards the production of egg and sperm, and b) pre-implantation and early post-implantation period. Treating patients using anti-cancer drugs during sensitive periods of development is inadvisable since these periods are crucial for development of normal cells. Abnormal methylation patterns in the genome brought by these drugs will cause activation of certain undesirable genes and even mutations that will lead to formation of abnormal cells.</p></div>
