    <div class="field-value"><p>For cancer cells, there is an overal global loss of DNA methylation and a regional gain of DNA methylation (primarily at CpC islands and their shores). As a result, increased DNA methylation at CpC island silences many genes (including tumor supressor genes, while increased hypomethylation of<span> intergenic regions and repetitive elements reduces DNA compaction, </span> increases genomic instablity, activates strong promoter regions (faulty transcription) and deregualtion of tissue specific and imprinted genes.  Overexpression or underexpression of genes can lead to cancers by impacting DNA repair enzymes, histone modifications, chromosome structure, promoting oncogenes, promoting tumor growth, silencing genes and increasing genetic mutations.  Genomic-wide hypomethylation in cancer cells can also increase the number of errors during cell division resulting in insertions, transposon activation, deletions, change in chromosome numbers, gene relocation and DNA damage..  These changes may also lead to faulty targeting of lnc- RNAs and altered spatio-temporal nuclear architecture and transcription errors.  Overtime in cancer cells , control of several genetic and epigentetic regulation levels are disrupted resulting in abnormal cell growth and spread of cancer cells.   Genetic mutations or epigenetic deregulation may initiate tumorgenesis, but over time, both genetic and epigenetic factors will contribute to the cancer cell longevity, rate of cell growth and division, drug resistance, and cancer spread.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Proper imprinting is required for proper development and gene expression.  An indivifual usually has only one active copy of an imprinted gene (materanal copy for Wilm's tumor); improper regulation of  imprinted genes can lead to having 2 active copies or 2 silenced gene copies.  Normally, after development these genes are down regulated.   So epigenetically, we may have overexpression of imprinted genes, underexpression of imprinted genes or problems from mistiming of gene expression or activation of genes in the wrong cell lines.  H19, a lnc-RNA, contains a differentially methylated region that in also a ICR.  This ICR is differentially methylated at its CpGs .  Usually the paternal copy is methylated and silent, while the maternal copy is hypomethylated and expressed.  As H19 expression decreases the expression of Igf2, a neighboring gene increases.  In the case of Wilm's tumor, the maternal ICR region is hypermethylated and as a result H19 is slienced and production Lgf2 is increased (overproduced).  The induction of Wilm's tumor may be related to the unbalanced growth promotion of Lgf2 and/or decreased suppressor effects of H19. The paternal allele is silenced and is unable to compensate for disruption of proper imprinting on the maternal alelle.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.  It is incorporated in the DNA of actively growing cells and blocks (stops) DNA methyltrasferase.  The result is hypomethylation of DNA in actively growing cells that have exposure. <span> Hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation.  One possible  mechanism for the drug's anti-tumor effect is restored activity of tumor suppressor genes or decrease activity of oncogenes. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hyper or hypomethylated DNA status is passed onto future cells during mitosis.  Epigenetic drugs may change the balance of tumor suppressor gene activity, but may also change the DNA architecture such that DNA repair enzymes can access damaged DNA and increase genomic stability.   As cells continue to divide these positive changes may cascade and slow tumor growth, such that the other agents (drugs)  are more effective at lower doses.  A sensitive period is generally a development period (egg development to puberty) when germ lines (euchromatin) is highly active and epigenetic markers are being layed down.   DNA is especially vulnerable to damage during sensitive periods.  If you were to damage DNA or epigenetic controls in the germ line during development that DNA damage or altered epigenetic state  would/could be passed onto future generations as birth defects, disease or miscarriages: likewise damage to active tissue stem cells  could create damage tissue lines.   DNA mutations or damaged epigenetic controls  may only be expressed in certain cell lines that result in near future cancers, genomic instability, decreased epigentic regulation and tumor growth promotion in these tissue types. .</p></div>
