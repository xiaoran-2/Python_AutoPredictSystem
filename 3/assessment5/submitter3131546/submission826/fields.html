    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is altered in cancer in two ways; on the one hand, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation; on the other, genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>
<p>In the first case, hypermethylation can be observed in CpG islands and CpG islands shores. CpG islands are found approximately in 60% of human promoters and are usually hypomethylated in normal cells, being related with gene expression. However, they tend to be hypermethylated in cancer cells, leading the genes silencing and, as a consequence, causing the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. This hypermethylation increases with time, and there are different phenotypes of CpG islands methylation which are involved in many types of cancer.</p>
<p>On the contrary, introns, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated, being involved in maintaining genomic stability. DNA methylated is compacted as heterochromatin, which prevents recombination between chromosomes. De‑methylation of intergenic regions promotes chromosomes opening, which lead to translocations between them and loss of imprinting. Moreover, repetitive elements which are hypomethylated regain the ability of coping themselves and moving throughout the genome. As a result, copies of repetitive elements can disrupt others genes or activate them.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Expression of imprinted genes has parental origin and many of these genes are related with cell growth. Changes in DNA methylation have been observed in these genes in cancer, which means there is a loss of imprinting due to hypomethylation, which increases the expression of genes involved in cell growth, or due to hypermethylation, which causes loss of expression of genes that limit cell growth. H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of loss of imprinting in cancer.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, H19 is maternally expressed and Igf2 is paternally expressed. ICR unmethylated in the maternal allele allows the bound between ICR, CTCF and its cofactors, which facilitates enhancers to bind the H19 promoter. H19 is expressed, but not Igf2. In the case of the paternal allele, ICR and H19 promoter are methylated, so there is not binding between ICR and CTCF, and the enhancers can access Igf2. There is expression of Igf2 from the paternal allele, but not H19.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumour is characterized by the hypermethylation of the ICR on the maternal allele. In both alleles, enhancers access Igf2. There is no expression of H19 but there is a double expression of Igf2, a gen which promotes cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor and an analog of 2′-deoxycytidine, a nucleoside derived from cytosine. This drug acts over the epigenetic enzymes DNMTs and is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, because it has been observed that DNMT3a is mutated in myelodysplastic syndrome. When decitabine is incorporated into the DNA strands, the DNA methyltransferase binds the drug and is inhibited, which leads to the hypomethylation of DNA. It is possible that this drug has two different effects in the cell. First, the DNA hypomethylation can provoke cell death by cytotoxicity. The second mechanism is that hypomethylation causes cell differentiation and reactivates genes that had been previously inactivated.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs can modified DNA methylation directly, afecting transcription factor activity or altering expression of signaling molecules, receptors and other proteins. As a result, genetic regulation is altered and the cell tends to adapt itself to the new environment, causing permanent modifications to DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those when epigenetic reprogramming takes place, such as the early embryonic development and the primordial germ cell development. During these periods, some epigenetic marks are removed in order to express genes that are needed. Therefore, epigenetics enzymes are active during these periods of de‑methylation and re-methylation.</p>
<p>Drugs are able to bind epigenetic enzymes and modifiers, as well as inhibit their function, but the most of them are not specific. In the case of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase it is necessary that cells be in division, and this happens mainly in cancer cells, where DNA is being replicated continuously and epigenetic marks are being established each cell cycle. These drugs affect cancer cells more; however, if drugs were used during sensitive periods, they could affect all tissues in the same way, because in all of them the epigenetic enzymes would be working. As a result, normal tissues would suffer alterations or abnormalities.</p></div>
