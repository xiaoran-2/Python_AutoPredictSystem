    <h1>Submission 911 from Anon (session_user_id: a8aaf60f7642343065c81d91a21cb57fa6a9c093)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a inhibitor for DNA methyltransferase, therefore it is a hypomethylation agent.When a cell divides,  the new strand of the DNA can't get (fully) methylated.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, promotor CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes are methylated in most cases (and thus silenced). In presence of Decitabine these methylated CpG islands will disapear (in the daughter cells) and the tumour seppressor genes will get activated. This will at least slow down tumour growth (but might have severe adverse reactions as the whole DNA will get hypomethylated, including repeats, transposons,...)</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands suppresses genes associated with these CpG islands (about 60% of all promotors contain a CpG island). In a normal cell, these marks regulate imprinting of genes, X chromosome inactivation and formation of heterochromatin. </p>
<p>In a cancer cell, most time the genes for tumor suppressors and regulation of apotosis are silenced by methylation of their CpG islands (hypermethylation of CpG islands). This makes the cancer cells to generate a tumour, consisting of immortal cells.</p>
<p>In normal cells, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements protects the DNA from unwanted modifications and damages, e.g. by avoiding of expression of transposable elements.</p>
<p>In a cancer cell, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated (that is not or less than normal methylated).</p>
<p>This is (probably) a reason for the fact that the DNA of tumours contains lots of errors like transposons, additional repeats and mutations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the promotor of the H19 gene and the ICR are methylated. Thus, H19 is not expressed and CTCF can't bind to the ICR which makes the enhancers taking effect on the Igf2 gene which gets expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, nothing is methylated within the H19/Igf2 cluster. Thus, CTCF binds to the ICR and directs the enhancers to the H19 gene which gets highly subscribed.</p>
<p>Patients with Wilm's tumour show hypomethylation of the H19/Igf2 cluster at the paternal allele. This makes the paternal allele to 'act' as a second maternal allele. In consequence, H19 gets overexpressed while expression of Igf2 is decreased. This leads to dysfunctions in the development process and to Wilm's tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alternation of DNA methylation can have enduring effects on which genes are being expressed (methylation of CpGs in Promotors and CpG islands suppresses expression of the corresponding genes, demethylation can activate expression)</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a time period within development of an individual in which the epigenetic marks are changed ('reprogrammed').</p>
<p>For mammalians, the early development of the embrio and the germ cell development are the sensitive periods.</p>
<p>Treating a patient during a sensitive period would disturb the normal epigenetic reprogramming process, possibly causing severe adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Talking about cancer and chemotherapy, this means that pragnant women shouldn't be treated and man shouldn't beget a child during the period of treatment. </p></div>
