    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>At CPG islands, DNA is generally not methylated, which allows it to remain open and be transcribed. An exception occurs when CpG islands are methylated for X-chromosome suppression early in development.  In cancer, CPG islands become hypermethlated.  When they are hypermethalated, CPC islands become inactive, their functions are inhibited.  Specifically, the tumor suppressor genes are silenced, and this silencing is mitotically heritable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated.  In cancer, there is a genome-wide de-methylation of these regions that occurs early in tumorigenesis, which activates them and allows them to proliferate.  These regions are no longer heterochromatin, and there can be oncogene activation. Moreover, genomic instability can now occur through deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations.  The epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable, and tumorigenesis can progress.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Hypermethylation (or sometimes hypomethylation) can cause loss of imprinting with the resulting expression of both alleles (e.g. Wilms’ tumor) or neither allele.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated and therefore the enhancers are not blocked from reaching Igf2 by CTCF and therefore Igf2 on the paternal allele will be expressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated.  Igf2 will be silenced because CTCF will bind to and insulate the unmethylated gene and the enhancers will act on H19 instead. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In Wilms’ tumor, hypermethylation means that the maternal allele will also be methylated, with the result that the Igf2 will be activated on the maternal allele as well as the [paternal allele, and there will be a “double dose” of Igf2.  Igf2 is growth promoting, and this “double dose” can be observed in certain childhood kidney tumors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">By disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster, growth-promoting genes will be overexpressed.  This often occurs early in tumorigenesis.  The cells then grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor rather than dying.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors called DNA-demethylating agents.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase and thereby prevents hypermethylation (CpG islands) and restores normal function to tumor suppressor genes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>By Decitabine acting as a DNA-demethylating agent, it enables tumor suppressor genes to function, and a damaged cell will undergo apoptosis and die rather be a tumor fueled by oncogenes that grows and proliferates.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the genome because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable.  In particular regarding cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands can cause inactivation of tumor-suppressors, while genome-wide hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause oncogene activation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are being laid down and when environmental interventions can have permanent impact by altering gene transcription throughout the lifetime.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">In mammals, two such sensitive periods are gametogenisis and the early development period after fertilization (or analogous period if IVF) prior to somatic maintenance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Treating patients during sensitive periods can increase the risk of imprinting disorders.  It is very difficult to target specific outcomes during sensitive periods without the potential of collateral impacts that are unknown.</span></p>
