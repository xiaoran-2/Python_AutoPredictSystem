    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to DNA, which is established and maintained by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT’s). It is associated with silencing of gene expression and occurs almost exclusively at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. CpG sites are sparse throughout the human genome, but there are regions of high CpG density (CpG islands) and these are usually found at the promoters of tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells, CpG islands are unmetlyated, meaning associated genes, such as tumor supressors, can be actively transcribed. CpG’s found outside promoter regions, in repetitive elements and intergenic regions, are normally methylated and this is thought to protect against undesirable transcription of repetitive elements, which may lead to insertional mutations. Methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to aid genomic integrity. </p>
<p>DNA methylation is a dynamic process, which is not completely error-free and mistakes can occur and accumulate over time. Research has shown that the pattern of methylation that we see in cancer cells is radically different to that of normal cells. In cancer cells the CpG islands (and also CpG island shores) are hypermethylated resulting in the permanent silencing of the underlying protective tumour-supressor genes. If this happens then the cells may begin to grow too rapidly. If the cells are otherwise normal they will form benign tumors. If the cells are already abnormal, due to accumulated genetic errors, and proliferate too rapidly and also start to invade other tissues, then you end up with malignant tumors. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated in cancer cells leading to global hypomethylation of the genome. This means that the genome is essentially now unprotected from transposable elements and oncogenes can also become activated, resulting in overall genomic instability. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting occurs when particular genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. An example is the H19/Igf2 cluster. On the paternal allele of this cluster the ICR is methylated preventing CTCF binding and H19 promoters are methylated, thus silencing H19 expression. This allows enhancers to drive promotion of Igf2 expression. In contrast, on the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated allowing CTCF to bind to sites in the ICR, blocking enhancers from driving the promotion of Igf2, so enhancers drive promotion of H19 expression instead. The result is that H19 is expressed and Igf2 is silent on the maternal allele, whereas Igf2 is expressed and H19 is silent on the paternal side.</p>
<p>A common feature in some cancers and disorders is loss of imprinting, due to disruption of DNA methylation patterns at imprinted loci. In the case of Wilm’s tumour we see loss of imprinting due to disruption of methylation on the maternal allele. The ICR on the maternal side becomes hypermethylated, so you end up with Igf2 being expressed on the maternal allele in addition to the paternal allele. This increased amount Igf2 (a growth promoter) is thought to stimulate the growth of tumour cells.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent belonging to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi’s). It is similar in structure to cytidine and gets incorporated into the cells DNA during replication. However, due to its different chemical structure its binds DNMT irreversibly. When the cells divide this means that DNMT can’t maintain methylation and this process continues as cells keep dividing. Overall you end up with less and less DNA methylation. We know that cancer cells replicate more rapidly than normal cells, so they are affected to a greater extent. The decrease in DNA methylation, due to low doses of Decitabine, re-activates the expression of tumor-supressor genes, which had been silent in the cancerous cells.  This in turn suppresses tumorigenesis, hence the anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs, such as decitabine, can have an anti-tumor effect, by altering DNA methylation in dividing cells. Cancer cells which divide more rapidly than normal cells are affected to a greater extent. Once the drug has made changes to the DNA these changes are perpetuated every time the cells divide, so over time many more cells carry the modification. The pattern of DNA methylation is heritable through mitosis and from one generation to the next, so can affect the epigenome long term, even after the period of drug treatment has ended.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are when active reprogramming of the epigenome takes place, i.e. the removal and re-establishment of epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation. Two such periods are during pre- and early post-implantation and during primordial cell development through to the production of mature gametes. During these periods the epigenome is also sensitive to changes in the environment (such as what medicines you take), which can influence gene expression. Therefore, it would be inadvisable to treat patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these sensitive periods as they could interfere with the establishment of epigenetic marks and potentially lead to defects in subsequent generations. </p></div>
