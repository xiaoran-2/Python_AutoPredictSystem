    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation can be altered in cancer. Typically in normal cells there is little methylation at CpG islands, whereas in cancer cells frequently CpG islands become hypermethylated. Many tumour suppressor genes neighbour CpG islands, hypermethylation of the CpG islands can caused the DNA to be compacted and as a result these tumour suppressors can be repressed(i.e. their proteins are not expressed). With tumour suppressors knocked down, cancer is more likely to ensue</p>
<p>On the other hand in large areas of the Genomes DNA(introns, ingenetic regions and repeated elements) CpGs are frequently methylated in normal cells. This typically causes the chromatin to be more tightly bound and thus less expressed. In cancer cells there is a Genome wide hypomethylation, as a result these typically methylated regions become demethylated in cancer cells. This can lead to genomic instability, as frequently the areas affected(in cancer) are repeated elements. One of the problems is that expression of repeated elements can lead to illegitimate recombination, and translocations(repeated elements that are not compacted are more likely to recombine). Sometimes intergenic promoters are also affected(i.e. activated) which again can lead to the expression of other genes often to the detriment of genomic stability. This loss of stability can lead to cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Disruption of imprinting in cancer can occur because of hypermethylation (or sometimes hypomethylation) of Imprint control regions. It can affect the expression of genes that are typically expressed from either the DNA inherited from the father or from the mother. Let’s look at the specific case of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In healthy cells the ICR (Imprint Control Region) is methylated in DNA inherited from the father - this ultimately leads to the expression of the Igf2 gene from the fathers DNA. Because the ICR is methylated the CTCF protein cannot bind to it - the Igf2 is not inhibited (by CTCF) and as a result of the nearby enhancers can lead to its expression.</span></p>
<p><span>However for the mother ICR is not methylated so the CTCF protein can bind- this inhibits the expression of Igf2 and as a result the enhancers act on H19 gene instead and is it expressed from the mothers DNA.</span></p>
<p><span>In Wilms tumour this is disrupted however, as the mothers ICR becomes methylated - this causes the mothers and fathers DNA to act alike and both produce Igf2, with neither producing H19. Igf2 is important for growth, so it's over expression can lead to cancer </span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor. Decitabine can inhibit (stop) DNA methylation upon cell division. Decitabine gets incorporated into the cells DNA, and then upon cell division it blocks the daughter cells from obtaining DNA methylation (at the spot it gets incorporated beside). Cancer cells divide more rapidly, and as a result the drug has a greater affect on them than healthy cells. The drugs acts by stopping the hypermethylation of CpG islands near genes (i.e. it causes a return to hypomethylation). These genes can now be expressed (as hypomethylation of the nearby CpG islands is associated with expression- the DNA is less tightly packaged and more easily transcribed).These genes are often tumour suppressors, and therefore(their expression) can have anti cancerous affects</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Drugs that change DNA methylation can have a lasting affect because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. So any change to these epigenetic marks will get passed on. As cancer cells divide frequently, changes in Epigenetic structures can have a disproportionate effect on cancer cells.</span></p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods are occasions in development when Epigenetic markers i.e. DNA methylation and histone methylation are changing (i.e. marks added or removed). Periods of Epigenetic reprogramming are sensitive periods. For example within the first 6 hours after fertilisation many methylation marks from the fathers DNA are removed (a slightly different pattern occurs for the mother - slower and requires cell division, i.e. passive demethylation). Sensitive periods include resetting of marks in early development, resetting in Primordial germ cells and in cell differentiation.</span></p>
<p><span>During sensitive periods DNA methylation and demethylation naturally occurs in healthy cells. Using drugs that affect DNA methylation could disrupt this process resulting in development issues in addition to any cancer problems</span></p></div>
