    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is important as an epigenetic mechanism to assist in normal development of an organism. It is associated with genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and suppression of repetitive elements and when disrupted, carcinogenesis and neoplastic tumour formation.</p>
<p>CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are all involved in the maintenance of a stable genome. DNA methylation disruptions to the regions are critical in the evolution of neoplasia.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands in promoters are most likely to be unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated.</p>
<p>Two types of DNA methylation aberrations in epigenetic control occur in cancer cells leading to the opposite situation to that seen in normal cells:</p>
<ol><li>locus specific DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes which results in the loss of imprint control regions; and</li>
<li>genome-wide DNA hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions.</li>
</ol><p>GpG islands promote gene expression by regulating chromatin structure and transcription binding. Normally DNA methylation of promotor regions is inversley related to gene expression with the exception of the CpG islands found in the majority of promoters.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements are DNA sequences that only encode for proteins instrumental in their replication and insertion into new locations within the genome. DNA methylation of repetitive elements silences replication and has an impact on transcriptional stability and the stability of the genome as a whole.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions are sites of transposable and viral elements existing within the genome. DNA methylation silences the expression potentially harmful parts of the genome, hypomethylation will remove this silencing and allow for their expression.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. If enough DNA methylation changes are inflicted on enough cells, the epigenetic changes induced by alterations to DNA methylation will be locked into next generation cells ensuring the growth of a neoplastic tumour.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genes can be impaired and expressed in a monoallelical fashion. Igf2 and H19 are two genes that are oppositely imprinted and expressed monoallelically. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele and H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is needed to maintain normal imprinting patterns associated with Igf2/H19 cluster. Alterations to DNA methylation at imprint control regions can cause the loss of expression of growth restricting genes and over expression of growth promoting genes. Such alterations can lead to genes that should display monoallelic gene expression being expressed biallelically or silenced biallelically.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele in a normal cell, H19 is methylated and therefore silenced. The imprint control region is not insulated by CTCF gene binding enabling enhancers to act directly on Igf2 allowing for Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the imprint control region is bound by CTCF gene. Enhancers therefore act directly on H19 leading to the expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster acts as a tumour suppressor mechanism in normal cells. In Wilms tumour, hypermethylation of H19 on both the maternal and paternal alleles causes double expression of Igf2, removal of tumour suppression and rapidly increased growth promoting activity.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleotide analogue that is incorporated into DNA once it is converted to Decitabine triphosphate. It's incorporation into DNA occurs at replication causing inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for methylating newly manufactured DNA in cells. DNA methyltransferase binds to the nucleotide analogue at the time of replication in an attempt to copy DNA methylation to daughter cells but is instead irreversibly bound and can no longer be released.  Hypomethylation of DNA during replication ensues.  Decitabine is therefore a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor acting as a hypomethylating agent.</p>
<p>DNA methytransferases are division dependent and when inhibited by Decitabine there is cellular apoptosis. Cancer cells are rapidly dividing cells so are especially suseptible to Decitabine effects at relatively low doses sparing other dividing cells that are normal. </p>
<p>Decitabine is really effective on haematopoietic malignancies possibly because these neoplastic disorders are dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the course of treatment because DNA methyltransferase inhibitors work to inhibit methyltransferase at the point of cell division when DNA is being newly synthesised. They bind DNA methyltransferases irreversibly so they cannot be released and this epigenetic change is then mitotically inherited from mother to daughter cells over a series of generations until the changes are actively erased.</p>
<p>The problem with this mitotically inherited effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors is that they can be picked up by non-cancer cells, causing unintended side effects.</p>
<p>The most likely times for this to happen are during sensitive periods of development of an organism when there is rapid cell division and epigenetic re-programming.</p>
<p>The two main sensitive periods are:</p>
<ol><li>primordial germ cell development and gamete production; and</li>
<li>early embryonic pre-implantation development.</li>
</ol><p>Treating patients during sensitive periods could result in abnormalities to primordial germ cells; abnormalities in the gametes derived therefrom; the viability of gametes and their fertility expectations could be compromised; zygote formation could be compromised; normal blastocyst division and movement to the next phase of implnatation and embryonic development could be compromised and epigenetic alterations might result in the development of inheritable abnormalities not necesarily beneficial to life.</p></div>
