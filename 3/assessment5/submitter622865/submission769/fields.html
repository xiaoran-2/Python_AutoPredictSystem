    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation. Where CpG island methylation does occur, it is usually for the purpose of silencing gene expression, e.g., in differentiating different cell types or in X-chromosome inactivation. </p>
<p>In cancer cells, however, CpG islands are hypermethylated. They're not <em>all</em> methylated, but they are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells. CpG island “shores” also tend to be hypermethylated in cancer. In contrast, in normal cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be <em>hyper</em>methylated, while in cancer cells intergenic regions and repetitive elements are <em>hypo</em>methylated.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylated CpG islands are found in promoters of tumor suppressor genes. Such hypermethylation gives cancer an epigenetic way to silence tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so it is passed on as cancer cells divide, and such silencing epimutations can be rapidly selected for. A cell needs to undergo multiple “hits” (insults) to become cancerous (Knudson hypothesis). Silencing of tumor suppressor genes via DNA methylation can be one such hit.</p>
<p>Tumor suppressor hypermethylation often is more frequent than genetic mutations. In addition, different genes are often hypermethylated in different cancers, making CpG island hypermethylation useful as a biomarker. Some cancers are characterized by CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) where a <em>set</em> of genes is hypermethylated. In such cases, a <em>panel</em> of biomarkers may give superior diagnostic information.</p>
<p>With regard to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, their hypermethylation in normal cells contributes to genomic stability by suppressing events like transpositions. In cancer, the hypomethylation of these elements contributes to genomic instability, an enabling factor in the evolution of a cancer. For normal cells to progress to a cancerous state, various genetic and epigenetic changes need to occur. Genomic instability increases the probability of such changes happening by chance.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation (i.e., that are either hypomethylating or hypermethylating agents) can have enduring effects on the epigenome because DNA methylation is mitotically-heritable. I.e., DNA methylation marks are passed on to daughter cells when a cell divides. There are sensitive periods in development, however, during which epigenetic reprogramming occurs, including epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells and early development and active remodeling of epigenetic marks during differentiation of different tissue types. Treating patients during such sensitive periods would be dangerous because it might interfere with normal development. I.e., epigenetic marks that are needed to direct tissue differentiation, for example, could be compromised, causing the cells to differentiate abnormally or not at all.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells, one often sees hypo/hypermethylation of Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). This leads to a common feature of cancer cells: loss of imprinting. Imprinted cells should show mono-allelic gene expression determined by a parent of origin, but in cancer, one may see both alleles expressed or both silenced. Such loss of imprinting is cancer-related because imprinted genes often are involved in growth: either as growth promoters or growth suppressors. Loss of imprinting in cancer can occur via hypermethylation or hypomethylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Considering the specific case of the IGF2/H19 cluster, ICR is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. When ICR is unmethylated, CTCF will bind to its insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19, but IGF2 will be silent. When methylated, the enhancers can act on IGF2 and it is expressed. With loss of imprinting (via hypermethylation) IGF2 is expressed on both alleles – causing a double dose of IGF2 – which is growth-promoting. This condition is associated with Wilm’s tumor, a childhood kidney tumor. Such loss of imprinting is often seen in pre-neoplastic tissue, suggesting that it happens early on in the development of cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. I.e., it acts to reduce the methylation of DNA, thereby potentially counteracting epigenetic changes in cancer cells that lead to hypermethylation of DNA sites. Hypermethylation in cancer cells can have various effects, including the silencing of tumor-suppressor genes or loss of gene imprinting. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, which are the precursors of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Decitabine acts to demethylate DNA by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.</p></div>
