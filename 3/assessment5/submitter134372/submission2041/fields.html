    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the characteristic signature of DNA methylation comprises CpG dinucleotide methylation and Histone deactivating methylation (H3K9me and H3K27me) in regions of the genome with repeaters, transposons and other intergenic loci that, when activated, have the potential to cause chromosomal abnormalities and instability. CpG island promoters of genes (where transcription begins), tend to be methylated in Heterochromatin and unmethylated in Euchromatin in healthy cells. The absence of methylation in Euchromatin enables expression of the genes located there. Cancer cells, by contrast, present the opposite pattern of methylation. Regions populated by repetitive elements, transposons and other intergenic loci are hypomethylated, and Heterochromatin becomes more Euchromatin-like as Histone tail suppressor methylation marks are demethylated, while activating methyl (H3K4me) and acetyl marks are increased in those regions. CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes are generally hypermethylated, thereby silencing these cancer fighters, whereas the CpG islands associated with oncogenes, which are growth promoting, are hypomethylated, resulting in the characteristic uncontrolled growth of tumor cells. In general, cancer involves genome-wide hypomethylation with hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene CpG island promoters. Many of the epigenetic enzyme regulators like DNA methyltransferases, Histone acetylases and deacetylases, Chromatin remodelers, and Histone demethylases are mutated in cancer cells leading to the many abnormalities characteristic of the cancer epigenome. Futhermore, some epigenetic aberrations lead to the silencing of genes that are part of DNA repair mechanisms, thereby allowing the proliferation of mutations due to chromosome copying errors during cell division. All of these epigenetic changes affect normal gene expression and thus significantly increase the difficulty of analyzing and treating cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigenetic process wherein the expression of parental germ cell alleles (parent-of-origin expression) is passed to offspring. Expression is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs), for which the mechanisms can differ by locus, their parent-of-origin epigenetic marks established during primordial germ cell development. The particular epigenetic mechanism underwriting the expression of Igf2 in the H19/Igf2 gene cluster is an example of paternal imprinting. The ICR in the paternal allele is methylated, which is spread to the H19 gene, suppressing its expression. In the maternal H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing a protein, CTCF, to bind. This silences expression of Igf2 by blocking downstream enhancers that normally target the ICR. In the paternal cluster, by contrast, the enhancers are able affect the ICR, promoting Igf2 expression. This imprinting pattern is disrupted in Wilm’s tumor cells, specifically in the maternal allele, in which there is hypermethylation of the ICR and downstream CpG dinucleotides, preventing CTCF from binding to the ICR and allowing downstream enhancers to affect Igf2 expression. The result is overexpression of Igf2 (both alleles), which is growth promoting and thus supports tumor growth through proliferation of cells with this abnormality.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, sold under the brand name, Dacogen, belongs to a class of drugs known as demethylating agents (includes azacitidine, sold under the brand name Vidaza), the primary function of which is demethylation of the genome by suppressing the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), which are often mutated in cancer cells. Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. Its demethylation capabilities enable it to counteract the effects of cancers by removing methylation marks, especially those that silence expression of tumor suppressor genes. Consequently, as cancer cells divide, methylation marks on the DNA in daughter cells are diminished, and over time would be effectively removed, allowing the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed. Drugs like Decitabine tend to be effective against one or two types of cancer because the suppression of DNMT can either enhance or suppress tumor growth depending on whether the cancers are a result of genetic or epigenetic abnormalies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Demethylation removes methylation marks, especially those in CpG islands associated with tumor suppressor genes, which helps fight cancer. Because re-methylation of the DNA in daughter cells is suppressed, methylation marks are washed out of the population after a number of cell divisions, and thus has lasting effects on the epigenome. The problem, of course, is that such drugs can affect healthy cells. Because of this, it can be problematic for development if such drugs are taken during certain sensitive periods, both pre- and post-natal. Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming, when epigenetic marks have been removed and new marks are laid down. The periods include early (pre-implantation) embryonic development and primordial germ cell development, which lasts all the way through puberty. If demethylating drugs are given during those periods, it can have lasting effects if the epigenetic marks are prohibited from being laid down, since this could result in abnormalities both in the germ cell line and, potentially, in the developing individual. Presumably, it would not be advisable for women to take such drugs if pregnant, or expecting to become pregnant and for children that younger than about 10 or 12 years of age.</p></div>
