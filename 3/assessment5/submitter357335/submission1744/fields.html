    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normal function of CpG methylation at CpG islands (which are mostly situated in promoter regions) is to inhibit expression of genes. Such islands exhibit low level of methylation in normal cells, but are frequently hyper-methylated in cancer cells. Expression of some genes in cancer cells is thus suppressed compared to normal cells. This contributes to abnormal cell functioning (cancer) because these suppressed genes are frequently tumor suppressor genes and lower level of their expression contributes to cell's cancerous behavior.<br /><br />Normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements (they are frequently methylated in normal cells) is to inactivate them. They are hypo-methylated in cancer which lead to effects such as illegitimate recombination, activation and transposition of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters. These can all contribute to cancer by disrupting genome integrity or interfering with normal levels of gene expression in genes whose abnormal level of activity contributes to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 imprint control region is unmethylated on maternal allele and methylated on paternal allele. Unmethylated imprint control region (maternal allele) is bound by CTCF protein which insulates Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers. The enhancers in question are then free to enhance the H19 gene which is situated between them and imprint control region. On the paternal side of things aforementioned enhancers are free to act on Igf2 and don't act at all on H19 because it is methylated from methylation expansion of imprint control region. In the end, H19 is produced from maternal and Igf2 from paternal allele.<br /><br /> In Wilm's tumor imprint control region is hypermethylated on both paternal and maternal alleles. This leads to overexpression of IGf2 gene which is an oncogene. It produces overabundance of Igf2 which is a growth promoting protein hormone that can contribute to cancer when present in supra-physiological doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNMT inhibitor. It incorporates into DNA and inhibits DNMT. It may restore normal methylation (demethylate cytozines that are normally unmethylated, but are methylated in cancer) in cancer cells. It is also generally cytotoxic to dividing cells (and cancer cells are rapidly dividing) in higher concentrations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This is possible because DNA methylation pattern is transferred to daughter cells via DNMT. This means that altered DNA methylation pattern will stay altered in daughter cells and subsequent cell generations.<br /><br />Sensitive period (epigenetic-wise) is a period in organism development during which intense genetic reprogramming is taking place. Interfering with normal epigenetic programming at this stage could have detrimental effects to organism since practically all epigenetic marks of (future) organism are set up de novo. Such periods are early prenatal period and period during which gametes are formed. This means that it would be unadvisable to administer epigenome-modifying drugs to girls in pre-menarche period when their oocytes are being formed. Also such drugs should not be administered to couples that are trying to conceive because it could interfere with epigenetic reprogramming during spermatogenesis in males or influence the epigenetic reprogramming of early post-zygote of carrying mother.</p></div>
