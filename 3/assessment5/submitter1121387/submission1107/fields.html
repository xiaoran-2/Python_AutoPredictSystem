    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally speaking, DNA methylation are affected differently in cancer depending on genomic sequences involved. CpG islands, which are generally unmethylated, become hyper-methylated. This happens at high frequencies at the promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes in all cancer types. Similar trend has also been observed for CpG island shores. Obviously, this epigenetic inhibition of tumor suppressor genes mean that cancer cell types have selective advantage. On the other hand, the  repetitive elements, introns and the intergenic region, which are generally all repressed by DNA methylation in normal cell types, become hypo-methylated in cancer. This results in aberrant expression of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which in turn leads to translocated genomic regions, and insertion/deletion type mutations. This genomic instability brought about by DNA hypomethylation at these normally repressed regions not only exposes cancer-prone cells to further epigenetic mutations by affecting epigenetic machinery, but also directly affects normal transcription and post-translational modification of many proteins required for normal cellular behavior. Besides, altered DNA methylation is also observed in imprinted genes during cancer; normally imprinted genes are either expressed or repressed from both chromosomes during cancer. One such disruption of imprinting is observed in H19/Igf2 cluster (which is explained below). In this way, we can see that during cancer, genome-wide alteration of DNA methylation pattern leads to aberrant expression or repression of genomic regions, with further downstream mutagenic consequences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Exactly how imprinting is disrupted in cancer can be understood by studying changes in the H19/Igf2 imprint cluster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Igf2 and H19 genes are located on either sides of an Imprint Control Region (ICR). Normally, in maternal chromosome, this ICR is unmethylated, acting as a binding target for an insulator CTCF protein, which blocks the genomic interaction between Igf2 and an enhancer region located downstream of H19 gene. This means that the enhancer region is free to interact with H19 promoter for its expression. In paternal chromosome, however, only Igf2 gene is expressed thanks to the hyper-methylated ICR, which brings about silencing of H19 gene and open access of the enhancer to Igf2 gene (because CTCF does not bind to the methylated ICR). </span></p>
<p>In cancer, the H19/Igf2 ICR in maternal chromosome can be hypermethylated, which makes it behave like the H19/Igf2 ICR in paternal chromosome. Consequently, expression of H19 gene is suppressed in both chromosome, while Igf2 is expressed by both. Overexpression of Igf2, a growth promoting protein, leads to tumor-specific cellular phenotype, as is the case with children suffering from Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p>In this way, epigenetic (or mere genetic mutations) disrupts mono-allelic genotypic expression in cancer, leading to over or null expression of the normally imprinted genes making people prone to diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of DNMTi (DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor) drug family, and has been known to be effective in treating Myelodysplastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, which when once incorporated into DNA during DNA replication, irreversibly attaches itself to the DNMT enzyme, thereby hindering DNA methylation of the CpG sites during cell division. Since tumor requires multiple cell division, tumor and tumor-prone cells are heavily affected by DNMTi as opposed to normal cells. In this way, being a DNMTi drug, Decitabine suppresses division-dependent DNA hyper-methylation of CpG islands near tumor-suppressor genes found in lymphomas. Other modes of action pertaining to anti-tumor effect, which are not yet known, are also feasible.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>During the course, we have learnt that epigenomic changes occur in combination. DNA methylation is seen along with different types of repressive histone modifications (like H3K9me and H3K27me3). Therefore, it is certainly possible that DNA methylation facilitates further suppression of gene expression via repressive actions of histone modifications. Equally important to keep in mind is the fact that DNA methylation is actively maintained during cell division. So, once a drug (or a combination of drugs) alter DNA methylation in subset of potentially heavily dividing (and therefore, tumor-specific) cells, not only is the DNA methylation of daughter cells affected, they become susceptible to further (or other) epigenetic changes -- without the daughter cells necessarily having a need to be treated by the drug. </p>
<p>As can be imagined, during the sensitive periods of development (i.e. periods of pre-implantation and germ-cell development), when the DNA methylation marks are actively (or passively -- i.e. through cell division) removed, any exposure to drugs affecting DNA methylation would have severe consequences. DNMT1-knockout in mice have shown to be fatal, for instance. Clearly, treating patients with DNA methylation drugs during the sensitive periods can bring about many unintended and malicious epigenetic mutations that can last patients' lifetime, which in itself would be minimal in expectation.</p></div>
