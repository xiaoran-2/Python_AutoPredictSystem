    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Usually DNA methylation is inversely proportional to gene expression at promoter sites, meaning the greater the gene expression, the less DNA methylation at that particular promoter. This, however, does not apply to CpG islands found in promoter regions. Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine islands can be genetically active regardless of whether they are methylated or not but usually CpG islands are not methylated. In cancer, CpG islands become hypermethylated thereby silencing the promoter and hence the gene. Also in cancer cells, there is a genome wide loss of DNA methylation and gain in certain regions of DNA methylation. Hypermethylation in CpG islands found in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes enables them silent. In normal cells, the intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns are methylated. In cancer cells, the opposite is true with introns, repetitive element, and intergenic regions being hypomethylated. This causes genetic instability allowing illegitimate recombination between repeats. Methylation of repeats causes them to become active and enable transposition. Also, deletions, insertions, and reciprocal translocations can occur in the DNA. Furthermore, hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters activates genes in cancer that are usually silenced. In summary, genome wide hypomethylation and tumour suppressor gene hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs) causes loss of imprinting in cancer cells. In normal cells, at the H19/Igf2 cluster, the imprint control region is methylated in the paternal allele and unmethylated in the maternal allele. CTCF can thereby bind to the ICR in the maternal allele allowing the enhancers to act on H19 leading to its expression and Igf2 will be silenced. In the paternal allele, the enhancers will act on Igf2 allowing its expression since CTCF does not bind to ICR and H19 will be silenced. In Wilm’s tumour, the ICR region in the maternal allele is also methylated causing both the maternal and paternal alleles to express Igf2 and both to silence H19. Igf2 is growth promoting which causes Wilm’s tumour</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is incorporated into DNA upon replication. DNA methyltransferase binds to it when creating a daughter strand, and can no longer be released, thereby inhibiting it in the daughter strand. This drug requires active DNA replication in order to be effective so cancer cells are affected greater by the drug than normal cells due to there more active replication. Decitabine allows for the normal function of tumour suppressor genes to be restored. It also causes the death of cancer cells since it is toxic to rapidly dividing cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mutagenic. DNA methyltransferase inhibition by drugs may cause the genome to become unstable. Methylation at repetitive elements is required to maintain genomic integrity by silencing repeats to prevent transposition and detrimental recombination. Sensitive periods include primordial germ cell development to production of mature gametes and also preimplantation period to early post-implantation period since in both periods there is active remodeling of the epigenome. In sensitive periods, DNA demethylation occurs. Somatic maintenance period is less sensitive. When the epigenome is actively remodeling during sensitive periods, drug treatment can cause unintended DNA aberrations and mutations such as deletions, insertions and reciprocal translocations. Due to the activity of cells during sensitive periods, they would be targeted by the drug as well as the active cancer cells affecting normal cells and imprinted genes detrimentally and the effects would be irreversible and passed on to daughter cells.</p></div>
