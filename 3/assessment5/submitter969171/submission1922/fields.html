    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, CpG islands are often unmethylated. CpG islands are typically hypomethylated and are often found in the gene promotors, their methylation supresses gene expression. In normal cells this methylation is essential for Imprinting as well as histone modification, however in cancer cells CpG island methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) refers to the silencing of tumor supressor genes in certain cancers through the methylation of CpG islands or their shores. The causes of CIMP are not fully elucidated however patient age, gender, microsatellite instability and tumor location are all thought to play a role. CpG island methylation can silence tumor suppressor genes such as those involved in coupling the cell cycle to DNA damage or initiating apoptoses, thus the cancerous cell can divide without proper restraints and evade death while it grows and damages surrounding tissues.</p>
<p>The methylation of intergenic regions and repititive elements gene directly impedes transcriptional machinery in these regions. In addition to this <span>methylated DNA can bind with </span>methyl-CpG-binding domain<span> proteins (MBDs). M</span>BD<span> proteins can bind other proteins to the locus, including </span>histone deacetylases<span> and other </span>chromatin remodelling<span> proteins that can modify </span>histones<span>, forming heterochromatin structures. </span></p>
<p>Global hypomethylation is a long established hallmark of cancer. Mutations affecting DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) are what causes this hypomethylation and it can be induced in mice by mutating DNMT1. This hypomethylation prevents the formation of ordered heterochromatin and ultimately results in the breakdown of the 3D chromatin architecture. This has long been known to result in genomic instability, typical effects are the recombination of repeat regions, the activation of repeats and transposons and the disruption of nearby genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An imprint control region (ICR) lies between the H19 gene and the Igf2 gene. On the paternal allele this ICR is methylated, this results in the methylation of the H19 gene, prompting downstream enhancers to act on Igf2, thus Igf2 is expressed by the paternal allele. In healthy cells the ICR between H19 and Igf2 is unmethylated on the maternal allele, this results in the transcriptional repressor CTCF binding to the ICR where blocks the downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2. Instead the enhancers act on the unmethylated H19, thus Igf2 is not expressed by the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Methylation of the maternal ICR between H19 and Igf2 is seen in Wilm's tumour. This prevents CTCF from binding to the ICR, thus the enhancers can act on Igf2 on both the paternal and maternal allele and Igf2 transcrition is greatly increased. The Igf2 gene codes for insulin-like growth factor, the increase in transcription resulting from the methylation of the maternal ICR results in a higher dose of growth factors. The unchecked growth resulting from higher doses of growth factor enables cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine has been quite successful in the treatment of individuals with Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the function DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>Decitabine becomes incorporated into the DNA of the cells it enters, there it binds to DNA methyltransferase preventing further methylation, and ultimately leading to cytotoxicity. DNA methyltransferase is far more active in rapidly dividing cancer cells than in healthy cells, </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation or demethylation is mitotically heritable thus it can persist through many divisions even within cancer cells. This pattern of methylation constitutes a part of the epigenome which naturally persists.</p>
<p>These are periods where cells undergo epigentic reprogramming whereby large amounts of DNA are demethylated and then methylated in order to ensure the fidelity of the epigenome. There are two primary sensitive periods, firstly between the formation of the zygote and the blastocyste general where general epigenetic reprogramming takes place, and then during gametogenesis where progenitor gamete cells undergo both general epigentic reprogramming and the reprogramming of the Imprin control regions (ICRs) which differ between maternal and paternal alleles.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that DNA-demethylating agents might have damaging effects during sensitive periods of epigenetic programming. This is because it is of vital importance that during epigenitc reprogramming, the correct alterations of DNA methylation are made. The use of DNA-demethylating agents during sensitive a sensitive period such as gametogenesis would almost certainly shift the balance towards demethylation during epigenetic reprogramming. This would radically alter the epigenome of the developing sperm or egg, ultimately resulting in defective gametes.</p></div>
