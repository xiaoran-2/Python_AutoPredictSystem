    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silent the genes expression, in metastatic tissues there is hypermethylation on the CpG islands and hypomethylation on intergenic regions and repetitives elements, hypermethylation on CpG islands lead to silence tumor supressor genes.</p>
<p>In cells the role of repeat element and intergenic regions is to conserve the genome integrity however in cancer cells we have hypomethylation in repeat elements and intergenic regions, such hypomethylation can lead to delation, insertion and reciprocal translocation, thoses mutations can contributes in human diseases, for exemple mutations in DNMT3B result in icf syndrome where genomic instability is a characteristic feature.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by silencing growth suppressor  or overexpressing growth promoter.</p>
<p>In the h19/lgf2 exemple we can see that in a normal cell only the paternal allele has methylation on imprinting control region allowing the expression lgf2 while on the maternal allele unmethylated ctcf4 bind is insulator element, lgf2 remain silent.</p>
<p>In the case of a cancer cell, there's hypermethylation of the imprinting control region on both alleles, creating overexpression of lgf2 who is a growth promoting associed in Wilm's tumor.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent use to treat the myelodysplastic syndrome, decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, by this process of demethylation, normal function to the tumor suppressor genes is restored, thus restoring control over cell growth.        </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive period is the time of development when environment has the biggest influence on the epigenetic makeup. The sensitive periods are the moments when the epigenome is actively remodeled, in mammals the sensitive periods include the primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm and the preimplantation and postimplantation periods.</p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs can alter the epigenome during sensitive periods and we know that epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter cells, that's why treating patients during sensitive periods is not recommended </p>
