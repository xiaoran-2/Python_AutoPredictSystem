<p>DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl residues to DNA which is a modification of cytosine by adding methl group (CH3) to the number 5 carbon of the cyosine pyrimidine ring.  This modification can be inherited through cell divison (mitosis) and occurs almost at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. P refer to phosphodiester bond between cytosine and guanine nucleotides.  The regions of the genome that have a higher concentration of CpG sites are known as CpG islands.  Normal DNA methylation occurs primarily at two developmental stages: early embryogenesis &amp; gametogenesis.  Somehow epigenetic alteration occurs which alter the heritable state of gene expression by fomation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin states around gene transcription sites and gain of methylation in normally unmethylated CpG islands in these regions.  The aberrant methylation of gene promoter regions begin very early in tumor progression, affect over half of the tumor suppressor genes can lead to cancer. It has a long range impact on the phenotype without altering the genotype.  These gene promoter CpG islands acquire abnormal hypermethylation which results in trascriptional silencing  that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division. In normal cell, we can find hypomethylation in the CpGisland region but the genome is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and the intron of gene.  In contrast, the cancer cell more likely to have hypermethylation or just methylated in the CpG island region but the repetitive elements, the intergenic region and the intron of gene are hypomethylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>With Imprinted genes, we inherit only one working copy from either paternal or maternal alleles while the other is imprinted or silenced.  Since most of imprinted gene we found are involved in growth,  either promoting or suppressing. With some kind of abnormal imprinted control can lead to cancer. Let's consider Igf2/H19 cluster from human chromosome11.  In a normal maternal allele, CTCF insulator protein insulates Igf2 growth factor from downstream enhancer which enhance H19 expression and suppress Igf2 factor while on the other hand, we have methylated paternal allele on the imprinted control region of the cluster where CTCF no longer binded.  Without an insulator protein, enhancers are free to act on Igf2  which lead to Igf2 growth factor expression on the paternal allele.  Igf2 is a growth promoter in this case possible oncogene.  However, with the loss of imprinting control, you have hypamethylation of the imprint control region in both parental allele and it lead to expression of Igf2 on maternal allele as well.  Now you have double dose of Igf2 which is growth promoting and it is associated with Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>Decitabine is a class of a drugs known as DNA demethylating agent.  Methylation of DNA is a major mechanism that regulates gene expression in cells.  It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It is indicated for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes.  Decitabine anticancer effects work in 2 ways.  First  it works by demethlation or interfering with the methylation of DNA, this will restore the normal function of tumor suppressor genes and gaining the control of cell growth.  Secondly, it belongs to the category of chemotherapy called antimetabolites. When cell incorporate Decitabine into cellular metabolism, it interacts with number of targets within the cell to produce a direct cytotoxic effect that causes death of rapidly dividing cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>                       </p>
<p>Epigenetic drugs altered tumor cells in some lasting way because drugs involve transcription factors are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells till they are actively erased. Once erased, they do not return. Sensitive period define when epigenetic marks are actively remodel, it happens in 2 separate time, first on primordial stem cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms.  The second sensitive period is period between the pre-implanted and early post implantation period.  Both period show active remodelling of epigenome.</p></div>
