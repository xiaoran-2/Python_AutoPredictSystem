    <div class="field-value"><h2><span>Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.</span></h2>
<ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The normal function of CpG islands are hypomethylated in the genome, there is not any methylation in general. </span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Most if not all of the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated in comparison to a normal when cancer becomes prevalent. The rest of the genome including the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements become hypomethylated.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The CpG islands are usually tumour suppressors genes. Since they become hypermethylated and there is associated gene silencing, this causes the creation of a tumour and is considered irreversible. Over time there is increased methylation of the CpG islands. Hypermethylation is synonymous with mutation in the single gene examples in RB, MLH1, BRCA1 and MGMT.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The rest of the genome is methylated including the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are methylated when functioning normally.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">There is a swap in function with the rest of the genome, that include the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, that become hypomethylated. </span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The recombination between repeats become illegitimate at the sign of cancer which leads to reciprocal translocations, the repeats copy themselves and transpose themselves within the genome. Deletions occur as well as insertions are made into the chromosomes.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><h2><span>Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster.</span></h2>
<ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The imprint control region on the paternal allele is not methylated, the CTCF acts as an insulator element and thus the enhances go ahead and act on the H19 but the Insulin Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) will not be expressed.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Due to the imprint control being methylated the enhances will act on the Insulin Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) since the CTCF is not binding to the imprint control region on the paternal allele to insulate it.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">In Wilm’s Tumour the Insulin Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) are expressed in both the paternal and maternal allele.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The over-expression of the Insulin Growth Factor 2 (IGF2) is the cause of Wilm’s Tumour in children because of the growth promotion from the dual dose of iGF2 from the paternal and maternal allele. This is known as loss of imprinting (LOI) which has been found in types of cancers such as hapatoblastoma, leukemia, breast cancer, prostate, lung, and liver.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong> </strong>In the case of Decitabine, it is known as an inhibitor of methylation in the DNA by removing the inhibitory methyl groups from the promoter sequences in the cytosine residues. This may allow the epigenome to be more susceptible to chemotherapy treatment since cancer has been shown to  thrive by acting as a gene silencer.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Sensitive periods are when a patient may have a susceptibility to medications or treatments while they are in the process of recovery. Usually they are already being administered treatments for a condition that they already have. </span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The patient is not in “the clear” to be receiving any other form of alternative or formal treatment while undergoing the previous originating treatment. It could last for a determined amount of time until the treatment or medication subsides as it may complicate or frustrate the recovery process.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The patient may experience serious and/or severe adverse affects to a medication due to the patient being already undergoing treatments for a condition they may have during a sensitive period.</span></li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:

<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

<ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">Decitabine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agent family of epigenetic inhibitors called DNMTi which is FDA approved.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">The impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation is that it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferases, for instance specfically DNA methyltranferase one. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes which is a precursor to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. It incorporates itself into the DNA at the replication stage and act to bind the methyltransferase to the daughter strand which then becomes irreversibly bound.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li class="li1"><span class="s1">At low doses, in comparison to the high dosages used in the 70’s that made patients sick, Decitabine has an anti-neoplastic effect that basically kills the tumour cells since it is believed that in most cases it causes DNA methylation.</span></li>
