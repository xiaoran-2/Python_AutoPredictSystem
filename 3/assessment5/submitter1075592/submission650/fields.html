    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>There are two methylation pattern changes seen in cancer, hypermethylation of CpG islands, and loss of methylation in intergenic regions.  </span></p>
<p>In healthy cells, CpG islands, which are often found in promoter regions, are not typically methylated, leaving the gene open to transcription.  In cancer, CpG islands become methylated, as in CIMP, and the chromatin tends to tighten up, silencing the promoter and therefore silencing the transcription of the gene.  If those genes are tumor suppressor genes or genes that start apoptosis, they will no longer function, growth of the cell will be less controlled and cancer can ensue. </p>
<div>In the intergenic regions, repetitive elements, and introns of healthy cells, methylation is often found, causing the repeats and retroviral insertions to be silenced, as would be desirable.  In cancer, hypomethylation on the intergenic region loosens the heterochromatin and opens up the transcription of repeats, illegitimate recombinations, and other disruptions to cell.  Also, hyper or hypomethylation can cause amplified or suppressed expression of growth factors or growth inhibitors on parent-of-origin imprinted genes, leading to the growth of tumors.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The good news is that these epigenetic mutations are reversible.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, the Imprint Control Region on the Maternal Allele is unmethyldated.  This allows the Blocker protein to bind to the ICR and then the enhancers cause H19 to get expressed.  On the paternal allele, the enhancer CTCF is blocked because of paternal allele methylation and the H19 promotor is also methylated, so the Enhancers activate the IGF2 gene which is a growth promoter.</p>
<p>With the loss of imprinting and hypermethylation of both alleles, CTCF cannot bind to either allele and IGF2 is doubly transcribed, overpromoting growth.  This is known to cause Wilms Tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent and causes hypomethylation or de-methylation of chromatin.  This would lead to the opening up of heterochromatin and the expression of improperly repressed genes, such as Tumor Suppressors.  It has been shown to be effective in lukemia and prelukemia.  One might imagine that it would be most effective in diseases that are known to be caused by tumor suppressor genes that are improperly silenced.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation is a heritable modification to the genome, only reprogrammed in certain sensitive periods such as gametogenesis and embryonic development (post-fertilization, pre-implantation), meaning the periods where DNA is undergoing significant epigenetic reprogramming.  This means that once a methyl mark is laid down, it will tend to stay there for the life of the organism.  Drugs that add or remove methylation of the genome will, therefore, tend to permanently add or remove those marks, making the cell and organism retain the effects of that drug permanenetly.  </p>
<p>Of course, playing with the epigenome during periods of epigenetic reprogramming, or even in the periods leading up to gametogenesis (puberty in girls, and longer in boys since spermatogenesis is an ongoing process), could have lasting effects on the germ cells and offspring, so it should be avoided.  The broad removal of methylation during gametogenesis, for example, could turn on genes that should never be turned on and could result in the germ cell becoming non-viable and the person, therefore, being sterile.</p>
