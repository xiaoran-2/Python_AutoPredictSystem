    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are usually demethylated, allowing the espression of the genes in whose promoters they are normally located. However, in cancer cells, these CpG islands get hypermethylated, resulting in gene silencing. CpG island hypermethylation contributes to cancer development through the silencing of tumour superssor genes.</p>
<p>On the contrary, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells, but get hypomethylated in cancer cells. This hypomethylation contributes to cancer development because it causes genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated, while the maternal allele is not. This means that in the maternal allele, the CTCF protein binds to the unmethylated ICR, and preventing the enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene (inactive). Therefore, these enhancers can only affect the H19 gene (active). On the contrary, on the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated, which prevents the CTCF insulator protein from binding, and allowing the enhancers to act on the Igf2 gene (active), and not on the H10 gene (inactive).</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour's cells, however, both maternal and paternal ICRs are methylated, which results in the expression of both Igf2 alleles (overexpression) and the silencing of both H19 alleles. This overexpression of Igf2 contributes to Wilm's tumour because Igf2 is a growth promoter gene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, that is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which inactivates DNMTs and prevents DNA methylation. This has an anti-tumour effect because it prevents or eliminates CpG islands hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable mark, so changes in DNA methylation patterns has enduring effects on the epigenome because they are maintained even throgh cell division, and therefore, long after the treatment period finishes.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period in an individual's development in which epigenetic marks are resetted, so they are periods in which epigenetic marks cna be more easily altered. The two main sensitive periods in development are Primary Germ Cell (PGC) development and early embryonic development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because it is unknown which effects could these drugs have on the next generation. The epigenome could be extremely altered if one of these drugs is administered during one of these periods.</p></div>
