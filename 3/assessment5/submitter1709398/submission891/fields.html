    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG dinucleotides, which are often found at the promoters of genes. Methylation of such a CpG island at a promoter is associated with silencing of the corresponding gene expression. CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation, so they are in general not methylated (hypomethylated).<br />In cancer cells, CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells (hypermethylation). As a result more genes will be silenced in cancer cells.<br />Especially tumour suppressor genes tends to be silenced in cancer cells, contributing to the survival of cancer cells. Furthermore, factors like DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and cancer cells die less and divide more than other cells, contribute to the disease.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are in general methylated. This is necessary to maintain genomic integrity and protect the genome from transpositions, transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and illegitimate recombinations.<br />In cancer cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements become less methylated (hypomethylated).<br />Less methylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes more genomic instability, which results in illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transpositions, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Parts of chromosomes gets deleted, inserted and reciprocal translocated. The resulting changed expression of genes contributes to disease.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the imprint control region is methylated. Therefore the CTCF insulator protein can't bind with the imprint control region and can't block the enhancers to activate Igf2. Igf2 is therefore expressed.<br />On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is not methylated. The CTCF insulator protein is allowed to bind with the imprint control region and as such blocks the enhancer from activating Igf2. Expression of Igf2 is therefore repressed.<br />In Wilm's tumour, the imprint control region on the maternal allele gets methylated as well and, just like on the paternal allele, Igf2 gets expressed from the maternal allele also. <br />This results in a double dose of Igf2 in comparison with a normal cell. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene. More Igf2 expression contributes to the growth of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent, i.e. a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi).<br />Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1). Preventing this DNMT1 enzyme to lay down the methylation pattern after each mitotic cell division, decreases the DNA methylation over time.<br />Lot's of tumours live on, because they manage to silence the tumour-suppressor genes. They silence these genes by methylating the promotors of these genes. This drug decreases the level of methylation after cell division, allowing the tumour-suppressor genes to be expressed and help protect the cells from cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so the altered DNA methylation pattern will be inherited by all daughter and granddaughter cells.<br /> A sensitive period is a period wherein epigenetic reprogramming is done. In this period epigenetic marks are still to be established.<br />Epigenetic reprogramming is done during primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms. A second period is pre-implanted and early post-implantation period.<br />In the context of cancer treatment the main sensitive period will be when young patients have developing germ cells in the process of epigenetic reprogramming. When the epigenetic marks have not yet been fully established, epigenetic drugs might disturb this reprogramming process in an unpredictable way. This might lead to abnormal germ cells, possible leading to other types of cancer for the patient, infertility, or epigenetic related problems to future generations.</p></div>
