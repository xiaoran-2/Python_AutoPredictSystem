    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is necessary for some epigenetic phenomena like imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. In the promoters regions, CpG islands are usually unmethylated and do not influence the expression of the gene. In cancer though, these promoters's CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which causes the silencing of the promoters's genes. <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The hypermethylation in cancer cells in the repetitive regions, which are specific for each cancer type, often target tumor supressor genes. That lead to an inactivation of those genes and thereby promote the survival of the cancer cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">The normal fonction of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability assuring that the cell does not gain or lose chromosomes or has illegitimate recombinations between chromosomes. In cancer cells, the intergenic region's methylation is less dense compared to normal cells. As the cancer progress the methylation differences between normal cells and cancer cells become greater. The consequence of this hypomethylation in these regions are illegitimate recombination between repeats like translocations, deletions or insertions because the chromatin is no longer densling package in these regions or it can simply activate genes because they are no longer repressed. These recombinations can activate or disrupte genes. This instability of the genome enhance tumorigenesis.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">On the paternal allele, the imprint controle region of the cluster H19/Igf2</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> is methylated. That doesn’t allow CTCF to bind his insulator element. Therefore the enhancers can act on Ifg2 and promote his expression. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">On the maternal allele, the imprint controle region is unmethylated. That allow CTCF to bind his insulator element and activate the enhancers which in turn promote the expression of H19, silencing Igf2’s expression.</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In Wilm’s tumour, the imprint controle region is methylated both on the paternal and the maternal alleles. That induce a doubling of the expression of Igf2. As Ifg2 promote cell growth, his over expression promotes cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent which belong to the class of the DNA methylt<span>ransfe<span>rase (DNMT) inhibito<span>rs</span></span></span>.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
