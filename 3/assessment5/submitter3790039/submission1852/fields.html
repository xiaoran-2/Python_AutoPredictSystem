    <div class="field-value"><p>In a non-cancerous cell, CpG islands are usually not methylated (hypomethylated) and assist with genomic stability (such as silencing an x chromosome). The areas surrounding the CpG islands, however are usually methylated; such as repetitive elements and intergenic regions. When cancer forms, the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated (hypermethylation), and hypomethylation is seen at the repetitive elements are intergenic regions. This change in methylation can affect disease by altering which genes are usually expressed and which are usually silenced. This can lead to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Normal DNA function from the intergenic regions and repetitive elements involves genomic stability. The purpose of these methylated areas (normal cells) is to make sure that there are no abnormal recombinations and that the correct number of chromosomes are maintained. Usually, recombinations can not occur as easily because the DNA is bound tightly and therefore does not move readily. When the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are epigentically altered and are no longer methylated, recombinations between repeats can occur that would not usually be possible because the DNA is no longer as tightly bound. Extra chromosome can occur and genetic stability can suffer. DNA methylation alteration at these intergenic regions and repetitive elements can also lead to deletions, insertions and translocations that would not have usually occurred resulting in disease. Repeats can become activated due to the loss of methylation in disease and start to copy themselves and move to different parts of the genome. This could disrupt the coding region of a gene and cause further issues. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by altering whether enhancers can act on various positions in the genome and the amount of a particular protein that can be produced. The methylation pattern of the paternal allele for Igf2 is that the CpG island shores are methylated and ehancers are able to act on Igf2 causing CTCF to not bind to insulate ICR. On the maternal allele, these CpG island shores are not methylated and CTCF is able to bind to the insulating element. This then causes action on H19 and Igf2 is not longer expressed and silent. For Wim's tumour, it is seen that the maternal allele is methylated like the paternal allele and also expresses Igf2. So, instead of the usual dose of Igf2, it is being produced from both alleles and double the normal amount. Igf2 is growth promoting and this extra growth promotor is associated with Wilm's tumour. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster maybe contribute to disease by occuring early on and increasing the amount of expressed growth promotor leading to an increase in observed tumours.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases and therefore leads to hypomethylation of the DNA. This will only work when the cell is replicating which is useful when a tumour is developing because it is dividing more frequently. This hypomethylation may have an anti-tumour effect because it will reduce hypermethylation within the DNA that was leading to genomic instability and increasing the number of mutations through insertion, translocation, etc. The hypomethylation will also stop the suppression of tumour suppressing genes that were not able to be expressed due to the hypermethylation.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation with drugs such as Decitabine can have lasting effects on the epigenome, because it has altered an epigenetic state that is passed down through cell division to daughter cells. This means that once a cell has had its methylation altered, it will continue to divide into the 'methylation altered' cells and stop suppressing the tumour suppressing genes. Sensitive periods in human development are times when epigenetic marks are being established. These times include when gamete formation is occuring either for the patient or if the patient happened to be pregnant (would affect the later generations). Treating patients at these times would not be a good idea, because it may alter the usual epigenetic marks that would usually get laid down and have a negative effect on normal cell growth and development. DNA methylation might not occur when it usually would or vice versa. </p></div>
