    <div class="field-value"><p> CpG dinucleotides tend to be clustered into CpG islands. CpG islands are found in a great number of gene promoters and are usually unmethylated in normal cells. As DNA methylation of gene promoters usually reduces expression of the underlying gene, unmethylation of CpG islands in gene promoters promotes gene expression. Only a small subset of CpG islands is methylated among cell types and this methylation is mainly linked to silencing of gene expression (as it happens in X inactivation). In cancer cells CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated and hypermethylation of promoters of tumour suppressor genes (which control cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair) can promote tumour development. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which consist the main part of genome, are usually methylated in normal tissues. Their methylation maintains genomic integrity, as it silences cryptic transcription start sites and also silences repeats, thus preventing transposition between these elements. However, in cancer cells a hypomethylation of these regions has been observed. This hypomethylation permits aberrant recombination between repeats and also activation of crypting promoters. These events result in disruption of neighbouring genes and also in abnormal deletions/insertions/ translocations, thus leading to genomic instability. Genomic instability is known to contribute to tumour development as well as to other disorders, such as ICF syndrome. In general, cancer is characterized by a genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and a locus specific DNA hypermethylation. Some tumour types are driven mainly by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, while others by chromosomal instability due to loss of DNA methylation. Furthermore, alterations in DNA methylation in imprint control regions (ICRs) can result in either reduction of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes, contributing in this way to tumourigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is known that most imprinted genes exist in clusters and expression of each cluster is controlled by its own imprint control region (IGR). As regards H19/Igf2 cluster, ICR is methylated on the paternal allele and this blocks binding of protein CTCF to ICR. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreads to promoter of H19 gene, silences this gene and as a result downstream enhancers can access Igf2 and activate its expression. On the contrary, on the maternal allele CTCF binds to unmethylated ICR and as a result the long non-coding RNA, which is transcribed by H19 gene, prevents downstream enhancers from interacting with Igf2 gene, thus reducing its expression. In Wilm's tumour imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted and more specifically ICR is  methylated both on paternal and maternal allele, thus leading to overexpression of Igf2 gene. In general, IGF-2 factor (produced by Igf2 gene) acts as a growth promoting hormone during gestation. This means that its overexpression (through disrupting imprinting) can lead to overgrowth disorders (e.g. childhood tumours, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic inhibitor which belongs to the class of inhibitors of DNA methylotransferase (DNMTi). DNMTi are nucleoside analogues which are incorporated into DNA, bind irreversibly to DNMTs and inhibit their action. DNMTs recognize hemimethylated DNA during cell division and catalyze methylation of CpG dinucleotides on the unmethylated daughter strand (replication dependent action). This means that decitabine (as a DNMTi) consists a DNA -demethylating agent. There are tumours which are mainly driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation (abnormal methylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressor genes). In these tumours (e.g. myelodysplastic syndromes) reduction of DNA methylation can suppress tumourigenesis and therefore decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is  reversible and therefore its removal may be a therapeutic option in cancer. Moreover, after DNA methylation, as well as other epigenetic marks, have been removed by a therapeutic agent, they do not appear again. This means that drugs altering DNA methylation have enduring effects, which last beyond the period of drug treatment. A sensitive period is a period of active genetic remodelling (clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks). Sensitive periods of development include pre-implantation period during early development and  period of primordial germ cell development. It is known that during these sensitive periods different enviromental factors (e.g. drugs) can have  serious effects on epigenetic control of future generations. More specifically, a pregnant woman carries within her 3 generations (herself, embryo, gametes of the embryo). Thus, treating a pregnant woman with an agent which affects epigenetic control, especially during early gestation and mid-gestation , can affect seriously epigenetic status of future generations and should be avoided. Furthermore, oogenesis in females lasts up to sexual maturity, when oocytes complete meiotic division I. This prolonged development renders germ cells more vulnerable to enviromental effects. For this reason, use of such drugs in younger patients should be seriously considered.</p></div>
