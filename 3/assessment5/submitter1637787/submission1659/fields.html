    <div class="field-value"><p>The CpG islands tend to be found at the promoters of gene and they are usually unmethylated. In mammals DNA methyl transferases as DNMT3A and DNMT3B are responsible for laying down the methylation in a de novo fashion way while DNMT1 specifically, recognizes hemi-methylated DNA. These additions of methyl group(s) are associated with gene silencing and can happen by at least two mechanisms: the methylated CpG is bound by methylated CpG binding proteins that possess a transcriptional repression domain altering transcription by the condensation of the chromatin or these proteins can recruit their own partners that are able to condense the chromatin. In the secondary mechanism the methylated CpG will stop a transcription factor binding and enable the transcription of a neighboring gene.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated than in normal cells, being called CpG island hypermethylation. In general this CGI are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes leading to the silencing of these genes and helping the development of a tumor. And once it’s mitotically heritable these epimutations can be rapidly selected for and these cells are more likely to divide more rapidly or to not die as much.</p>
<p>For the intergenic regions and repetitive elements, the normal cells are usually methylated and are important to maintain the genomic integrity. Once DNA methylation is mutagenic (as methylated C is prone to deamination to T), it prevents the transcription of repetitive element that can allow transposition and illegitimate recombination. In cancer cells, these regions are hypomethylated leading to a genomic instability (deletions, transpositions, insertions) and then could modify the transcription of genes involved in the development of a cancer. The same hypomethylaiton is present in CpG poor promoters, leading the activation of oncogenes, while normal cells are methylated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can be caused by hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions in cancer cells, and the reason this is found in cancer is probably because lots of genes that are imprinted are involved in growth (promoting or suppressing growth), like Igf2.</p>
<p>In normal cells, in the H19/Igf2 cluster the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele and it's unmethylated on the maternal. When it's unmethylated CTCF (insulator element) and its cofactors bind the ICR, this interaction allows the downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter and Igf2 will continue being silent for the maternal allele.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the ICR this is methylated preventing CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows, now, the downstream enhancers to access Igf2 ant it is expressed.</p>
<p>However, in Wilm’s tumor there is a hypermethylation of ICR leading to a loss of imprinting on the maternal allele and then, an overexpression (twice more than a normal cell) of Igf2, a growth promoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor epigenetic class.  It is a DNA nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication, and then allows to the methyltransferase binding irreversibly the DNA and can no longer be released, then DNMT1 is no longer able to perform its functions leading to a dilution of of DNA methylation with every cell division. So the low doses of decitabine causes DNA demethylation and the action of these DNA methyltransferase inhibitors depends on the cell division, cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells will be more severely affected. It is interesting that only myelodysplastic syndrome seem to be affected by this DNMTi and maybe it is most effective in this syndrome because it might be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation which has a poor prognostic outcome. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, all epigenetic changes will be passed on during cell division. Then, if we take a drug like DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that prevents the action of DNMT1 (a demethylation transferase that recognizes the hemi-methylated DNA upon replication) the epigenetic change is passed to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. So, in this way the effects of this drug can last beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>As these drugs are not cancer selective, they can after a time change the epigenetic patterns of normal cells, so it is important to remember that there are sensitive periods in which the epigenetic machinery is being reprogramming, and if we take drugs during this time preventing methylation we can inhibit epigenetic markers that had to exist. And changing the epigenome could lead to diseaess caused for instance by imprinting disorders. These sensitive periods would be during the developing of germ cells and at later specific stages of differentiation during embryonic development.</p></div>
