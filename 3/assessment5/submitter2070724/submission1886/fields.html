    <h1>Submission 1886 from Anon (session_user_id: 5cc0fdce81f82b8c654e3905493c3a2b03f64c44)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is possible for epigenetic drugs to have a lasting effect that makes patients more susceptible to standard chemotherapy due to the ability of epigenetic changes to be passed down through cell division to the daughter and granddaughter cells. The drugs have the potential to prevent cancers from spreading further. These drugs have the ability to prevent the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that lead to tumorigenesis. Sensitive period refers to important times in development. Sensitive periods occur during embryogenesis/gametogenesis. This is considered a sensitive period because epigenetic marks are being established. In one experiment done with mice and alterations to their maternal diet, it was shown that between .5-8.5 days are sensitive periods where epigenetic reprogramming occur. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable due to the possible negative consequences that could occur. Epigenetic drugs alter DNA methylation that have an enduring effect on the epigenome. If treated during sensitive periods patients are exposed to these enduring effects that will affect development and establishment of the epigeneti marks that will be inevitably be maintained. Any treatment of epigenetic drugs during sensitive periods of development would affect the normal pattern of development. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation occurs at the C5 position of cytosine bases by adding a methyl group. Methylation at the C5 position typically occurs at CPG islands, which are regions of the DNA that have a high frequency of CpG sites. In cancer, we witness DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation. In locus specific DNA hypermethylation, the tumor suppressor genes are silenced and tumors are allowed to grow rampage. Hypomethylation happens genome wide at regions of repetitive elements and CpG poor promoters. Hypomethylation at repetitive regions causes genome instability that may be fatal to an organism or cause other instabilities that may lead to disease, such as cancer. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements normally promotes legitimate recombinations with no deletions, reciprocal translocations, or insertions. However, in cancer the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted and hypomethylation takes place. This leads to genomic instability and abnormalities in recombinations. It also leads to cryptic promoters to be activated and the neighboring genes are affected as well. Hypomethylation at CpG poor promoters can activate oncogenes, genes that have the potential to cause cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally the paternal allele is methylated and the maternal allel is methylated. Due to the unmethylation the CTCF4 insulator element causes the enhancers to act on H19. Igf2 is then silent on the maternal allele and not expressed. The opposite is true for the paternal allele. Since it is methylated the CTCF4 insulator element is not able to bind to the appropriate site and the enhancers act on Igf2 instead. Igf2 is thus expressed on the paternal allele. However, when imprinting is loss or disrupted, hypermethylation of the imprint control region can be seen on the maternal allele. What this means is that Igf2 is expressed on the maternal allele and on the paternal allele. This increase in expression of Igf2 is characterisitc of Wilm's tumour. Igf2 is growth promoting and an increased expression of it can lead to abnormal growth of cells leading to tumours. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA methyltransferases inhibitors. It works by targeting genes responsible for cell growth. Decitabine is directly incorporated into the genome and inhibits DNA methyltransferases from making contact causing hypomethylation of DNA. It can restore genes to its normal function, preventing abnormal cell division that may lead to tumorigenesis. </p></div>
