    <h1>Submission 324 from Anon (session_user_id: 9626c8bff6bf4bea0e90be5e28adaec6344ac38d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">DNA methylation has enduring effects on the epigenome because it is heritable. During mitosis one cell becomes two. The methylation state of parent chromosomes is reproduced in offspring chromosomes by DNA methyltransferases. Thus ordinary cell lines e.g. skin cells “do what they are told” because of epigenetic programming including DNA methylation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During rare periods in the development of an organism there can be demethylation with reversion to the undifferentiated, pliripotent state, known as epigenetic reprogramming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">A sensitive period is epigenetic terminology for times when certain enzymes and protein clusters perform epigenetic reprogramming removing and laying down epigenetic marks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Sensitive periods include the production and maturing stages of germ cell lines (oocytes and sperm) and the days immediately following fertilising the egg until gastrulation. Germ cell sensitive periods include intrauterine and prepubescent years and egg maturation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During sensitive periods DNA methylation marks and histone marks are removed and reorganised according to incompletely understood processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Treating patients with epigenetic modifiers during sensitive periods is inadvisable because disruption of the normal processes of methylation and other chromosome packaging markers results in changes that persist throughout the life of every cell line and are even passed on to offspring through parental imprinting of germ cell lines.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer there is disruption of normal epigenetic patterns. Over the genome as a whole there tends to be a loss of methylation but at some parts of the genome there is increased methylation. One such region that is commonly hypermethylated in cancers are the CpG islands (where there is a larger than expected proportion of cytosine followed by guanine) and their surrounding “shores”.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">CpG islands are commonly associated with DNA expression promoting regions of the genome. These regions need to be accessed in order for cell lines to function normally. They are usually unmethylated. When CpG islands become methylated, there tends to be the promotion of dense DNA packaging which prevents proper function and translation of these regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer CpG islands and their surrounding shores tend to become hypermethylated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer this CpGI hypermethylation leads to the loss of expression of what are known as tumour supressor genes and may lead to the expression of oncogenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Intergenic and repetitive elements are normally in a silenced, methylated state. These regions contain some very volatile genetic elements which are able to copy, jump and insert in other parts of the genome. Their functions are not clear and some may be parasitic viral remnants. Others may function in placental formation. In normal organismal development these regions remain silenced through methylation even through times of imprinting and epigenetic reprogramming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer there is widespread demethylation of intergenic and repetitive element regions of the genome. This results in the abnormal expression of many genes and genetic elements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Oncogenes within these regions promote unregulated tumour growth and cell division, and repetitive element proliferation inhibits normal cell differentiation and causes DNA mutation through improper chromosome crossovers and deletions.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer involves loss of normal orderly cell differentiation and developmental control. In the H19/Igf2 cluster we have two competing products. Igf2 is a growth factor and H19 is a growth inhibitor. In cellular and tissue development and growth, the balance between these two factors determines whether there is normal growth, accelerated growth or inhibited growth. A region called the imprint control region on each H19/Igf2 containing chromosome influences which of these two products H19 or Igf2 will predominate. The paternally derived imprinted allele functions to promote growth and the maternally derived imprinted allele functions to contain growth.</p>
<p>The paternal allele normally has a methylated imprint control region resulting spreading of methylation and silencing of H19 expression. Enhancers downstream bypass H19 and instead promote Igf2.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The maternal allele normally has a hypomethylated imprint control region. Protein CTFC binds the Igf2 promoter site preventing enhancers accessing Igf2. Enhancers downstream from H19 gene promote Igf2 production and thus contribute to growth inhibition and tumour suppression.</span></p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, the imprint control region is methylated in both the maternal and the paternally derived allele and maternal imprinting is lost <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">resulting in the expression of growth factor Igf2 is unopposed by H19 and cell lines grow and proliferate causing the local bulk and distant spread effects of the Wilms cancer.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic pre tumours and tumours.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Decitabine belongs to the class of epigenetic inhibitors (demethylators) that cause hypomethylation of DNA. Being an analogue of cytosine, decitabine can be inserted in DNA replacing cytosine at some sites. This may make the DNA methyltranferase, an enzyme that methylates DNA stall slowing methylation down and it is unable to efficiently perform it's function. This blocks the passing of aberrant hypermethylation epigenetic programming to daughter cells during mitosis</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cell lines that are proliferating (like cancer cells) there is a rapid synthesis of DNA and a need for DNA methyltransferase to quickly and efficiently transfer the DNA methylation epigenetic marks to daughter cells. Decitabine selectively restricts these rapidly proliferating cells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">The effect of inhibiting DNA methyltransferase is an overall reduction in methylation particularly of CpG islands and the promotion of more normal cell differentiation, tumour suppression and ultimately cell death. This is how decitabine selectively disrupts tumour development and proliferation.</span></p>
