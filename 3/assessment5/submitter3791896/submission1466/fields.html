    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA methylation is observed genome-wide in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, however DNA methylation is not usually observed in CpG islands of gene promoters.  In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation and regional hypermethylation are observed.  The hypermethylation is observed in CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes.  Disruption of DNA methylation contributes to disease in several ways; hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes results in silencing of the gene, this coincides with hypomethylation of CpG islands in the promoters of oncogenes results in activation of the gene.  Together these favour the development and expansion of cancer.  Normally DNA methylation is observed in intergenic regions and at repetitive elements providing genomic stability.  Methylation of these regions causes silencing thereby preventing transposition of repetitive elements, recombination at repetitive elements and also silences alternate transcription and splice sites.  In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation affects the intergenic regions and repetitive elements removing the silent state; without silencing at these regions the genome becomes unstable and susceptible to genetic mutations such as insertions, deletions and translocations as the repetitive elements can now transpose and recombine unhindered.  Additionally, alternate transcription and splice sites are also accessible.  Genetic mutations and accessibility of alternate sites for transcription and splicing allows for deregulation of other epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting.  The disruption of DNA methylation favours cancer through altering the expressed state of genes combined with overall genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the H19 gene encodes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) while Igf2 is a growth promoter gene (oncogene); downstream of Igf2 and upstream of H19 the protein CTCF has a binding site at the imprint control region (ICR).  When CTCF binds at the ICR it insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers.  At the paternal imprinted allele the ICR is methylated thereby blocking CTCF binding, and without CTCF the methylation spreads to the H19 promoter silencing expression of the lncRNA; methylation of these two sites allows the enhancers to activate Igf2.  At the maternal allele there is no methylation of the ICR and H19 promoter, consequently CTCF binds downstream of Igf2 blocking the pathway of the enhancers, instead the enhancers activate H19 and allow expression of the lncRNA.  Imprinting at the H19/Igf2 locus can be disrupted through loss of methylation, maternal genetic mutation causing the maternal allele to behave like the paternal allele, or inheritance of two paternal alleles and no maternal allele.  Loss of imprinting results in increased expression or upregulation of Igf2, and since Igf2 is an oncogene unchecked growth leads to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA methylation inhibitor which targets DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs).  Decitabine binds irreversibly to DNMTs.  Under normal conditions the DNA methyl transferase DNMT1 maintains methylation by detecting hemi-methylated DNA and adding a methyl group to the complementary strand.  When bound by Decitabine, DNMT1 is unable to maintain methylation and therefore each subsequent mitotic replication reduces the level of methylation, ultimately resulting in hypomethylation.  Methylation of DNA is associated with silencing of gene expression, removing this methylation can restore active gene expression.  In cancer genome-wide hypomethylation is observed alongside regional hypermethylation; hypermethylation occurs at CpG islands in the promoters of tumour suppressor genes resulting in silencing of the gene.  So, Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect by reducing the hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the tumour suppressor gene promoters thereby restoring the tumour suppressing activity of the gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation inhibitors are drugs that target DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) which are responsible for laying down and maintaining methylation of CpG dinucleotides.  These inhibitors irreversibly bind the DNMTs preventing their normal function.  As an example DNMT1 maintains methylation by detecting hemi-methylated DNA and adding a methyl group to the complementary strand.  When bound by an inhibitor, DNMT1 is passively demethylated through mitotic replication eventually resulting in hypomethylation.  The effects of epigenetic drugs are observed genome-wide, so the resultant hypomethylation will be seen in all cells, and as epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable the hypomethylation will then be maintained in subsequent generations of cells despite cessation of treatment. It is for this reason treatment during sensitive periods is inadvisable.  Sensitive periods occur when the epigenome is undergoing reprogramming and can easily be influenced by external factors.  The sensitive periods are pre-implantation and early embryonic development, and primordial germ cell development and maturation.  Treating patients during these periods could interfere with the epigenetic reprogramming occurring at the time.  During primordial germ cell development and maturation, treatment with an epigenetic inhibitor will also affect the germ cells and would therefore be transmitted to subsequent generations.</p></div>
