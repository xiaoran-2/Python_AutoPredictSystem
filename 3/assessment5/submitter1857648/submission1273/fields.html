    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="hg-tinymce-code"><em>the class of epigenetic inhibitors that  <strong>Decitabine</strong> belongs to is<strong> DNA Methytranferase inhibitor or abbriviated as DNMTi</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Impact of Decitabine on  DNA methylation:-</strong></h2>
<p> Decitabine(deoxy form of azacitidine)  being a  nucleoside analoges is incorparated into the DNA during replication(after its conversion to 5-aza dCMP followed by phosphorylation it gets incorparated in place of cytosine) and when a suitable methytranferase comes and binds to this inhibitor,the DNMTi binds to that nucleotide and to copy the methylation to the daughter strand .that methyltranferase is now irreversibly bound and can no longer be released thus prevents further methylation of otherparts of DNA .however the activity of this is division dependent so cancercells which show more uncontrolled division the action of this drug would be more potent. <br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-357d1f1c06e616798099335f/970238/asst-5/970238-52110b4836d970.16107924.gif" alt="" /></p>
<h2>Decitabine 's antitumour effects;-</h2>
<p>    Decitabine has shown antitumour effects incase of mylenodysplasticsyndrome(MDS) and Acutemylenoidleukamia(AML) where it demethylated the hypermethlyated P15gene in MDS thus showing antitumour effects.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting genes can contribute to cancer:-</p>
<ul><li>In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated due to which the CTCF does not bind to the ICR and therefore Igf2 is  expressed.</li>
<li>In the maternal allele the ICR is not methylated due to which the CTCF binds to the ICR leading to expression of H19 and silencing of Igf2.</li>
<li>In Wilm's tumour both the paternal and maternal allele  ICRs are methylated due to which ther is silencing of H19 gene in both the alleles and a double dose expression of Igf2 occurs.</li>
<li>studies have shown that disrupting imprinting at H19/Igf2 cluster reduced the H19 RNA to 20 fold from fetal kidney levels due to bialleleic expression  and loss of hetrozygosity.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands occurs during X inactivation where in a cell one of the either parents x chromosome is inactivated by methylating the Cpg island which leads to gene silencing . They are also known to play in transcription and regulation .</li>
<li>In a cancer cell these Cpg islands are hypomethylated  (these cpg islands are in general methylated as the gene associated have poor pramoters)due to which there is  gene activation of the associated oncogenes Ex-R-RAS gene in gastric cancer</li>
<li>the disruption of DNAmethylation in Cpg islands leads to activation of the tumour causing oncognes whose fuction is to induce tumour and improper regulation of the cell activity .these changes are mitotically heritable and epimutations are rapidly selected .</li>
<li>Intergenic regions and repitative elements are present in more quantity in the genome and they are mostly methylated  as their activation would disrupt normal trancription activity and splicing when introns are not methylated .and mainly the methylation of intergenic regions maintains genomic stability.</li>
<li>in the case of DNA methylation in cancers the intergenic regions,introns and repitative elements are hypomethylated  .</li>
<li>the disruption of  DNA methylation in intergenic regions contributes to disease by mainly contributing to genomic instability which includes illigitimate recombination between repaets ,activation of repeats and transposons, activation of cryptic pramoters and disruption of the neighbouring genes. this was seen contributing to disease in case of DNMT3B leading to ICF syndrome and many cases of human cancers.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>DNA methylation has enduring effects on epigenome because they are mitotically inheritable and also lead to epimutations which can be reversible .in case of Xinactivation the DNAmethylation of the whole chromosome seals the fate of the cell permanentely in some cases leading to mosaics. </li>
<li>sensitive period is a time period  during which active key epigenetic remodelling takes place and during which the environment may be able to influence the epigenetic makeup.</li>
<li>the period from germcell development all the way to production of mature eggs and sperm is one of the senstive periods and the others are preimplatation period and early post implantation period.</li>
<li>it is not advisable to take treatment during this periods as it this time period is sensitive to environment which may disrupt the  important epigenetic remodelling landmarks and these disruptions may also be inheritable by  transgenerational epigenetic inheritance</li>
