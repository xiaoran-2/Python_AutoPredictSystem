    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation at CpG islands silences gene expression.<br /><br />CpG islands are often located at the promoters of genes, and are usually<br />unmethylated.  When the CpG islands are methylated, several mechanisms come<br />into play to silence the associated gene, the most important of which is<br />methylated CpG binding proteins triggering condensation of chromatin.<br /><br />In cancer, specific CpG islands and their shores are hypermethylated.<br />Different cancers target different CpG islands.<br /><br />Cancers target CpG islands controlling tumour suppression genes. When these CpG islands are hypermethylated, the tumour suppression genes are silenced.<br /><br />Normally, DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements maintain genomic integrity, by silencing those regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>If these regions become active, they can be transcribed, generating unwanted RNAs. The activated repetitive elements on the two strands of DNA area can interact, leading to deletions, translocations<br />and insertions in the DNA.<br /><br />While cancer leads to localized hypermethylization at specific CpG islands, it also<br />hypomethylates the overall genome.<br /><br />The loss of methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements activates these areas that should be dormant, and the genomic damage that is normally prevented by DNA methylation takes place: cryptic transcriptions and splices and DNA modifications, including deletions, translocations and insertions.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation or hypomethylation of imprint control regions (ICRs)<br />can lead to loss of imprinting, overexpression of growth factors, and cancer.<br /><br />Here's what happens at the H19/Igf2 cluster:<br /><br />Normally, the ICR is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the<br />paternal allele.<br /><br />The unmethylated maternal ICR is bound by CTCF.<br /><br />CTCF is an insulator protein, insulating Igf2 from enhancers downstream on the ICR.<br />The enhancers act on H19, rather than Igf2.<br /><br />Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele, while H19 is expressed by the maternal<br />allele.<br /><br />Wilm's tumour arises when hypermethylation methylates the maternal ICR as well<br />as the paternal ICR.  Now, the maternal allele behaves like the paternal allele<br />-- the Igf2 gene is not protected by CTCF, which cannot bind to the methylated<br />maternal allele, allowing the enhancers to act on the maternal Igf2 gene. The<br />hypermethylation spreads to H19, silencing it.<br /><br />The disrupted imprinting leads to twice the normal amount of Igf2, a growth<br />promoter. The extra Igf2 promotes cancerous growth in the kidneys, Wilm's tumour.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor.<br /><br />Decitabine gets incorporated into the DNA on replication.<br />When DNMT1 attempts to maintain methylation after cell<br />replication, Decitabine binds the DNMT1 irreversibly.<br /><br />When given in low doses, Decitabine has a DNA demethlyization effect. While all<br />cells are affected, cancer cells replicate faster than normal cells, so they are<br />more affected.<br /><br />As I described in Q1, cancer hypermethylizes CpG islands controlling tumour<br />suppressor genes, silencing them. Decitabine blocks the copying of<br />DNA methylization when cells replicate. The new cells' contain unmethylated,<br />and therefore, unblocked, tumour suppressor genes.<br /><br />The tumour suppressors can now be generated and can attack the cancer.<br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome</strong></p>
<p>When DNA replicates, the new DNA is hemi-methylated.  The new DNA contains one<br />methylated strand from the original DNA, and one new counterpart strand of DNA.<br /><br />DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) copies the methylation from the original strand to the new counterpart strand.</p>
<p>If a cell's DNA methylation is altered by a drug, this mechanism will propagate the altered state to the cell's descendants, even after use of the drug is discontinued.<br /><br /><strong>Sensitive periods</strong><br /><br />The sensitive periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells<br />and early development.<br /><br />The early development period runs from fertilization, through the blastocyte<br />phase until reprogramming is complete in the epiblast stage.<br /><br />The germ cell sensitive period runs from mid-gestation and the differentiation<br />of primordial germ cells through the completion of gamete reprogramming.<br /><br /><strong>Why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable</strong><br /><br />In the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study, exposure to famine during the<br />peri-conceptional period (the sensitive periods) led to increased mental and<br />metabolic disorders.<br /><br />The increased likelihood of disease was associated with small changes in the<br />DNA methylation of metabolic genes.<br /><br />A parent taking an epigenetic drug during the sensitive periods could transmit the drug-induced epigenetic state to offspring, rather than the normal epigenetic state. The drug-induced epigenetic state could lead to disorders in the offspring.</p></div>
