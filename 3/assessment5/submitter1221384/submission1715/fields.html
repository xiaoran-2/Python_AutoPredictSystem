    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a process of adding the methyl group to a cytosine in the DNA molecule. 5-methyl cytosine is formed by specific enzymes, DNA methyltransferases. DNMT3a and DNMT3b are used for methylation <em>de novo, </em>while DNMT1 is used to maintain methylation of hemi-methylated strands after the cell division. Methylation at CpG islands (cytosine nucleotide bound to a following guanine nucleotide by phosphodiesteric link) has a purpose of gene silencing, when located in the promoter area. DNA methylation usually happens at intergenic regions and repetitive elements and it is associated with genomic integrity. It protects the genome from illegitimate recombinations and transcriptional interferences by silencing the strong promoters, which are found in those regions.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumour suppressor genes is known as a very efficient mechanism of turning the normal cell into the "abnormal". Hypermethylation of (usually expressed) genes, or even the whole "shores" of DNA is detected in various types and stages of cancer. The genes, which would usually help the cell to fight the abnormalities get hypermethylated-silenced.</p>
<p>DNA methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is decreasing in tumour cells. This is called "genome-wide hypomethylation", since repetitive elements and intergenic regions are spread throughout the genome. Illegitimate recombination between repeats, their activation, transposition, deletion and insertion are just few consequences of genome-wide hypomethylation. The reason is the abnormal expression of usually silenced, heavily methylated regions of DNA. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2/H19 cluster is an example of enhancer blockage by methylation. It all starts with DNA methylation of an ICR (Imprint Control Region) upstream of H19, long non-coding RNA. As the methylation spreads, it silences the H19 promoter. The enhancer (which is being expressed downstream of the H19) now cannot affect H19, so it affects the Igf2, which is located upstream of the whole previously described area. The whole process is an example of the paternally imprinted gene. On the other hand, there is a molecule called CTCF at the maternal allele, which is preventing methylation of the ICR so the enhancers can positively affect the expression of the H19, while Igf2 is being repressed. When maternal allele starts behaving like paternal (due to a mutation), or there is a disruption on the chromosome, the result is overexpression of Igf2, which causes Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Since Igf2 acts like a proto-oncogene, there is a significant chance for embryonic or childhood tumour. Overexpression of Igf2 as a result of the hypermethylation is also found in Wilm's tumour. Hyper/hypomethylation of ICRs can cause loss of imprinting.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is classified as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and is an FDA approved drug for treating some hematopoietic types of cancer. Decitabine acts as a nucleoside analogue. It incorporates itself into the DNA strand and irreversibly binds DNA methyltransferase, therefore disabling its further activity. Methyltransferase inhibitors might stop hypermethylation at CpG islands in certain promoter areas (e.g. in tumour suppressor genes), hence restoring their expression. Hypermethylation of imprint control regions might also be significantly decreased. The precise mechanism is still unknown, but results are more than satisfying. DNMT inhibitors can be combined with HACi (histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, another FDA approved drug), or with standard chemotherapy and increase the chance of slowing the tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a mitotically heritable process. This fact can explain cell's "memory" of the treatment that lasts longer than the period of drug treatment. Altering DNA methylation process with drugs might affect tumour cells and help re-establishing epigenetic marks characteristic for the normal cell. But there are some periods in human life when epigenetic reprogramming (therefore DNA methylation) cannot get interrupted. These periods are called sensitive periods. In early embryonic development (blastocyst stage) and in primordial germ cell development epigenetic marks are getting erased and re-established, and DNA gets demethylated. This is a natural process, which occurs in every living being and interfering with this process can have serious consequences (e.g. using DNA methylation altering treatment in females while oocytes are still developing). </p>
