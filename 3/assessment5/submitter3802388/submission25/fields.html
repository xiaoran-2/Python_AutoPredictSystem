    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Cancer cells have an overall decrease in methylation, including in repetitive elements and intergenic regions. However there are specific regions in cancer cells which are hypermethylated when compared to their normal counterparts (Hassler MR, Egger G. (2012). Biochimie, 94(11):2219-30).  Hypermethylation in cancer cells has been shown to occur at promoter CpG islands which are generally protected from methylation in normal cells.</p>
<p>Methylation at CpG islands in DNA leads to silencing of gene expression, and is associated with the formation of heterochromatin. In cancer, CpG islands for oncogenes can be hypomethylated leading to activation of these genes, while tumour-suppressor genes tend to be hypermethylated at CpG islands, resulting in silencing. The combination of active oncogenes and silent tumour-suppressors leads to cancer cells - those freed from the normal restrictions on growth and development.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at repetitive elements serves to stabilise the genome and helps maintain genomic integrity. Repetitive elements can transpose around the genome using genes which are contained within the element itself. These elements can cause insertional mutations when they transpose. Aberrant activation of genes adjacent to the strong promoters in these elements can also occur. In addition, there may be recombination events between copies of the same repeat in different parts of the genome, resulting in chromosomal rearrangements. Repeats can cause both genomic and transcriptional disruptions which can contribute to cancer. A closed chromatin structure signalled by DNA methylation prevents transposition of elements, aberrant activation of nearby genes and illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions, DNA methylation normally silences cryptic promoters. Transcription from cryptic promoters can result in transcriptional interference where the transcription machinery gets "knocked off" the gene, often resulting in a truncated message and a non-functional gene product. If this happens to a tumour-suppressor it can contribute to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) of the H19/Igf2 cluster. This prevents binding of CTCF to the ICR, allowing downstream enhancers to promote expression of the Igf2 gene.  Methylation also spreads from the ICR to the H19 promoter, silencing H19 on the paternal allele. </p>
<p>The maternal allele is unmethylated at the ICR, allowing binding of CTCF which insulates Igf2 from the enhancers. The enhancers act instead to promote expression of H19. Igf2 is thus not expressed from the maternal allele and is expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour arises when the ICR is methylated on <em>both</em> alleles. The insulating protein CTCF is unable to bind either ICR. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele as normal, but also from the maternal allele. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene and having two copies expressed gives these cells a growth advantage over cells with normal imprinting. Accelerated growth is one step down the road to cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation are mitotically heritable. If the methylation status of a cell is altered, it will pass on those changes to any daughter cells, thereby leading to lasting changes in the epigenome.</p>
<p>There are certain times, termed "sensitive periods", when treating patients with epigenetic drugs would be inadvisable. Sensitive periods are periods when an organism is particularly susceptible to environmental influences. Periods of epigenetic reprogramming (from pre-implantation to early post-implantation, and during primordial germ cell  development through to the production of mature gametes) are sensitive periods (Marnie Blewitt, Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression course, Coursera).</p>
<p>It is best to avoid treatment during pregnancy, as changes to DNA methylation at this time could have unintended and unwanted effects on the developing baby and possibly on children of that baby. Treatment when the germ cells are maturing could also have detrimental effects on the epigenome of offspring, and this too may potentially be passed down through the generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent (Cancer's Epicentre. The Economist, 7th April 2012). It is an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases and its use results in reduction of DNA methylation.  Where DNA methylation has resulted in silencing of tumour-suppressor genes, Decitabine could enable re-activation of those tumour-suppressors by reducing methylation at the promoter CpG islands or restoring normal imprinting when the imprint control regions (ICRs) of tumour-suppressors are hypermethylated. Re-expression of tumour-suppressor genes will result in an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>
