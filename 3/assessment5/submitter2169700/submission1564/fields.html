    <h1>Submission 1564 from Anon (session_user_id: fec5d55ec4f71a30e3d4dad7dbe5dd239469483a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. Decitabine is a cytosine nucleoside analogue that will be incorporated into a newly-synthesised DNA strand during DNA replication. Decitabine will then irreversibly bind to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), hence preventing DNMTs from proceeding with their normal function of methylating DNA. Since DNA methylation is inhibited, expression of tumour-suppresor genes are increased. The normal function of these tumour-suppresor genes are restored and they are able to prevent excessive cell growth that could lead to the formation of a tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands is to silence gene expression at specific cell types, via the formation of a repressive chromatin structure with the help of MeCP proteins. In cancer, CpG islands of tumour suppresor genes are hypermethylated. This leads to loss of expression of growth-restricting genes, leading to excessive cell growth proliferation and hence the formation of tumours.In cancer, CpG islands of poor promoters become hypomethylated which can lead to oncogene activation such as R-RAS in gastric cancer. Activation of such oncogenes further lead to excessive cell growth and proliferation, leading to cancer and diseases. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintains genomic stability by silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites to prevent abnormal karyotype that could have arose from deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions. DNA methylation at repetitive elements also help to maintain genomic integrity. The silencing of repeats prevent transposition, avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination. In cancer, there is a genome wide DNA hypomethylation at repetitive elements and intergenic regions. This causes illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes (c.f. Avy and Axinfu alleles). Overall, abnormal karyotypes are produced due to these genomic instability, leading to diseases and cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the Imprinting Control Region (ICR) blocks the binding of CTCF insulator protein, Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers can access Igf2 to activate the expression of Igf2. On the maternal allele, the DNA at ICR is not methylated. CTCF insulator protein is allowed to bind to the ICR and insulates Igf2 from downstream promoters. Hence Igf2 is not expressed on the maternal allele and H19 is expressed instead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, instead of being unmethylated, the ICR on the maternal allele is also methylated. This essentially gives the effect of 2 paternal alleles. Hypermethylation of ICR on the maternal allele leads to Igf2 overexpression. Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, and its overexpression leads to excessive cell growth and proliferation, forming Wilm's tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because it is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable. The alterations in DNA methylation would be passed on during cell division to daughter cells and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. </p>
<p>A sensitive period refers to a period of epigenetic reprogramming, where old epigenetic marks are cleared and reprogrammed. </p>
<p><span>Sensitive periods of development refer to the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development.</span></p>
<p><span>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable as the drugs may lead to many negative side effects. During sensitve periods, the epigenome is unstable and epigenetic reprogramming could be easily disrupted by the drugs' epigenetic effects. </span></p></div>
