    <div class="field-value"><p>Since more than 150 years, cancer have been and intriguing disease. We have moved from a perspective wich used to consider the mutations on the DNA code as the main reason on the origin of it to a new perspective wich includes the epigenome as a determinant factor in the expression. The epigenome is the map of expression of the genes, this means that is the epigenome that stablish wich genes are expressed or not trough a complex molecular machinery defined principally by the action of transcription factors, histone proteins, lncRNA's and methylation events. Cancer in this context may be viewed as a disruption on the normal estate of the epigenome. In a regular (normal) cell this epigenetic machinery fundamentally defined by methylation, acts as mechanism that i) enables genome conservation and blocks genomic instability events, this is achieved by the methylation of intergenic regions (transponsable, and repetitive elements) and ii) allows gene expression by hypomethylating CpG islands at promoter regions. In cancer cells the epigenome is heavily modified characterized by the general hypomethylation of the genome and the hipermethylation of specific locus on the genome like the CpG islands of the promoters. The general hypomethylation of the genome (and intergenic regions) contributes to the instability of the genome allowing aberrant events like reciprocal translocations, insertions and deletions of big portions of the chromosome wich in turns leads to the proliferation of tumor cells. Also expression of anti tumoral genes can be affected by the methylation of CpG islands on the promoters of this types of genes by turning off their expression trough the blocking of the sites where replication factors and enzimes attach on the DNA.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent wich hypomethylate the DNA. Since this drug is a nucleoside analog it can bee incorporated on the DNA sequence. The basic mechansim of action occurs when the DNA-DMTase binds on the nucleoside analogues region to methylated it but remains attached and therefore the DNA-DMTase cant no longer lay down anymore methyl groups in other parts of the DNA. This drug is dependent of the cellular division since it needs to be replicated in order to make effect. The anti-tumor effect is achieved because cancer cells tend to proliferate more rapidly (forming a large mass or a tumor) and therefore replicates much more decitabine nucleosides analogues leading to the global hypomethylation of the CpG islands of the promoter regions of the tumor supressor genes of these cells.  </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Clearly the usage of drugs that have action mechanism like the alteration of DNA methylation can have everlasting effects on the cells, however, in spite most of these mechanisms arent fully understood, events like the hypomethylation mediated by drugs like Decitabine is an irreversible process that leads to the reduction of avilable DNA-DMTase enzymes wich play a crucial role in the conformation of a normal epigenetic make up. These changes are heritable among daughter cells (at least for drugs that acts like nucleoside analogues) and will be forever affected by such mechanisms. The usage of drugs that alter the epigenetic machinery however is only recomended for adult organism or organisms that have already pass trough sensitive periods that occurs in early embrionic development, and trough primordial germ cell development where the epigenetic marks are erased and fixed again, since a major alteration in the epigeneic machinery in such early stages can lead to unpredictable consequences and large alterations that will be inherited by all the cells in a organism. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are several genes wich their epigenetic make up is not adquired by the individual, but rather is inherited from the sexual cells of the parents wich have an array of epigenetic marks up already stablished (like DMR), these genes are called "imprinted" and aberrant expression of the epigenetic marks can lead to disease and cancer. The cluster containing the genes H19 and Igf2 shows a differential pattern of expression depending on the origin of the allele, in maternally inherited allele the DMR  shows no methylation leaving open the region so that an insulator protein CTCF "covers" the DMR wich blocks the enhancer leading to the silencing of Igf2 and expression of H19. In paternal allele, the DMR and the H19 region are methylated and CTCF cant bind so the expression of H19 is supressed and the Igf2 turns "on". Several diseases are related with failures or aberrant expression patterns within these genes like PWS wich may be originated by a mutation, deletion or loss of the DMR. Wilms tumor can also be a product of these abnormalities and it happens because of the upregulation of Ifg2 (under Uniparental disomy form the father for instance) wich is a growth promoter that when is poorly regulated (loss of Cdkn1c) acts as an oncogene leading to cancer.</p>
