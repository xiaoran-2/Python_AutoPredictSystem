    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation is crucial in normal organism development and the alteration of DNA methylation plays important role in cancer development. In normal adult somatic cells, DNA methylation frequently occurs in the CpG dinucleotide context. However, CpG islands, the cluster of CpG dinucleotides which are found in functional gene promoters in 5’ end of most genes are normally non-methylated. CpG islands serve as transcription initiation sites for most of the house keeping genes and tumor suppressor genes. The non-methylated CpG islands in the gene promoter region destabilize nucleosomes and recruit proteins that create a transcriptional permissive chromatin state. In cancer cells, hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands of tumor suppressor gene are identified in multiple cancers. Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands is associated with gene inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene. In somatic cells, the aberrant DNA methylation patterns are transmitted to the daughter cells and cause long-term gene silencing. The silencing of tumor suppressor genes is the check point for tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Compared to the lower methylation status in CpG islands, genome-wide CpGs including the inter-genetic region, repetitive elements and lower CpG promoter are methylated in normal cells. Genome-wide DNA methylation is recognized as a key regulator of transcriptional stability. By recruiting other proteins, DNA methylation further stabilize nucleosomes. The methylation of lower CpG promoter of in normal cells inhibits oncogene expression. In cancer cells, a genome-wide hypomethylation is identified as an earlier epigenetic change to some degree in all types of tumor. This causes chromosomal instability including deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, etc. Although the hypomethylation of CpG poor promoter is less common than the hypomethylation of DNA repeats, it still can result in activation of oncogenes such as <em>R-Ras</em> in gastric cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><em>IGF2</em> and <em>H19</em> gene are reciprocally imprinted in most somatic cells. <em>IGF</em><em>2</em> gene expression is silenced on the maternal allele, whereas <em>H19</em> is silenced on the paternal allele. <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2 </em>share same 3’ enhancer. In maternal allele, unmethylated imprinting control region (ICR) located immediately upstream of <em>H19</em> promoter stimulates the expression of <em>H19</em>. CTCF, an insulator protein binds to unmethylated ICR and blocks the interaction between enhancer and <em>IGF2</em> promoter to silence <em>IGF2</em> gene. In paternal allele, DNA in ICR region is hyper-methylated. The methylation silences the transcription of <em>H19</em> and blocks the binding of CTCF so the enhancer can active the expression of <em>IGF2</em> gene. Any disruption of this parental-specific imprinting regulation can cause severe diseases. In Wilms’ tumor, the maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype. With a paternal pattern of methylation on the <em>H19</em> promoter, <em>H19 </em>expression is inhibited and IGF2 expression is activated. Overexpression of IGF2 causes increased cell growth. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is an overgrowth disorder with maternal ICR1 gain of methylation. Silver-Russell syndrome is a growth retardation disorder with paternal ICR1 loss of methylation in 60% of SRS cases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylating agent and is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). The hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of many important tumor suppressor genes (TSG) is associated with the transcriptional inactivation of TSG in hematopoietic malignancies. Many of these genes play important roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis. The inactivation of TSGs such as p15 (CDKN2B) by DNA hypermethylation may play a causal role in hematologic malignancies such as MDS and AML. The hypermethylation of CpG islands is epigenomic changes and is reversible by pharmaceutical drugs such as Decitabine. Upon uptaken by the tumor cells, Decitabine is phosphorylated and directly incorporates into DNA strands, inhibits DNA methytransferase, causes hypomethylation of DNA and restores the expression of important tumor suppressor genes that are critical to produce normal cells and kill abnormal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Chemotherapeutic drugs can cause changes in gene expression that last long after exposure has ceased due to the effect on epigenetic marks, such as effect of DNA methylation. There are two sensitive periods which undergo epigenetic reprogramming during human development. They are represented by clearing of epigenetic marks in early embryonic development and in primordial germ cell development. Regarding to DNA methylation, paternal genome undergoes rapid and active DNA demethylation after zygote formation until epiblast forms, while the maternal genome undergoes passive demethylation during the same early development period. Primordial germ cells start to develop at 3-4 weeks after conceptual and continue through the most of period of human life to form mature gametes. Chemotherapeutic drugs may disrupt the epigenetic reprogramming during these sensitive periods. These epigenetic changes can be inherited through the division to the daughter cells or through gametes to the next generation and cause long-lasting effect even after the cease of the use of the drug. DNA methylation changes might be extremely teratogenic during embryogenesis and might be potential carcinogenesis affect. This persistent side-effect of the chemotherapeutic drug makes treating patient in the sensitive period inadvisable.</span></p></div>
