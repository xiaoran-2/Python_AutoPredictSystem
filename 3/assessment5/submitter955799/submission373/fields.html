<p>Q1.<br />1. Describe the normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br />Gene methylation has the ability to silence genes and promoter regions.</p>
<p><br />2. Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br />Methylation of CpG islands in cancer often are hypermethylated and thus suppress genes<br />which regulate normal proliferation.</p>
<p><br />3. Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease.<br />DNA Methylation at CpG islands often suppresses gene expression of regulatory genes<br />allowing excess proliferation.</p>
<p><br />4. Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive<br />elements.<br />Methylation silences these regions</p>
<p><br />5. Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted<br />in cancer.<br />Hypomethylation of these regions may occur on a large scale.</p>
<p><br />6. Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements<br />contributes to disease.<br />Hypomethylation of the intergenic regions may lead to loss of imprinting, and to the<br />generation of lincRNAs which in turn can suppress such genes as p53. Also if global<br />hypomethylation occurs then many of the other pathway elements are interfered with and<br />normal proliferation is disrupted.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

<p>Q2.<br />1. Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines Igf2<br />expression status.<br />The paternal allele is hypermethylated and thus Igf2 is expressed.</p>
<p><br />2. Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines Igf2<br />expression status.<br />The maternal allele is not hypermethylated and thus H19 is expressed. Igf2 is not expressed.</p>
<p><br />3. Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.<br />Hypermethylation of the maternal ICR results in excess expression of the Igf2 growth factor.</p>
<p><br />4. Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease.<br />Loss of imprinting can result in hypermethylation and excess expression of Igf2. This results<br />in excess and uncontrolled proliferation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>

<p>Q3.<br />1. Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.<br />Nucleoside analog</p>
<p><br />2. Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.<br />Blocks and reverses hypermethylation allowing for normal growth and proliferation of stem<br />cells so as to reduce blast load in patient. May also in certain patients result in loss of<br />hypermethylation imprinting.</p>
<p><br />3. Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.<br />In MDS for example it acts as a hypomethylation factor and as with azacytadine may also<br />reduce imprinting of dysplastic stem cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

<p>Q4.<br />1. Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome.<br />Imprinting may be changed and then can propagate through mitotic proliferation.</p>
<p><br />2. Define what is meant by a sensitive period.<br />Sensitive period is when the cell is going through mitosis and imprinting may be lost.</p>
<p><br />3. Identify sensitive periods of development.<br />During mitosis.</p>
<p><br />4. Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.<br />May disrupt beneficial imprinting and cause other problems.</p>
