    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation in cancer include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation.This causes a genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and silencing of TUMOUR SUPPRESSOR genes by hypermethylation of their promoter  CpG  islands.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation at CpG islands (modification 0f theC 5 position of the cytosine base ) implies the basis for epigenomic phenomena : imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation of Cpg islands ie. promoter CpG island tend to be hypermethylated causing silencing of the gene ie a TUMOUR-SUPPRESSOR gene.</p>
<p>The DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence a gen and the product of that gen and the PROTEIN that started a cascade of signals no longer can be ACTIVE.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to have a rol in the regulation of gen transcription,embrionic development and differentiation and carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>The disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease because alters the normal signals in the fisiology of human organisms.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes by monoallelic DNA methylation ( mathernal or paternal alleles ) is important for embrionic growth and development</p>
<p>The H 19/ Igf -2 cluster has a different expression depending on the imprintig. The Igf-2 is maternal silenced. The H19 is paternal silenced.</p>
<p>The methylated paternal allele implies that IGF 2 is Active.</p>
<p>The methylated maternal allele implies that H 19 is Active.</p>
<p>In wilm s tumour the 2 copies of IGF 2 are active so there is a over stimulation to cell growth,that leads to formation of tomours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Decitabine ( Dacogen ) is a DNA-demethylating drug.</div>
<div>It is a cytidine ANALOG.</div>
<div>its a hypomethylating agent.Its mechanism of action is Hypomethyled DNA by inhibited DNA methyltranserase. </div>
<div>So ,they can restore the function of TUMOUR SUPPRESSOR genes.</div>
<div>It can only be incorporated into DNA strands.</div>
<div>Decitabine also belongs to a class of compounds called antimetabolites They interact with a number of compounds resulting in the death of rapid dividing cells.</div></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the systemic biology there is redundancy of signals and networks of signals that permit amplification and persistance of signals.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a limited period in which influences exert a profund effect in a biological system.</p>
<p>Major sensitivite period : from weeks 3 to 7.</p>
<p>Minor sensitivite period : from week 8 to term.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would result in major or minor physiological or morphological lesions and even death.</p>
