    <h1>Submission 922 from Anon (session_user_id: 40b22b98c5ae4da549a9d0db13fdff6fddc84a03)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent or </span>DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that reduces CpG island hypermethylation, which is a frequent characteristic of cancer cells, avoiding the silence of tumour supressor genes that are able to make the cell die or decrease its abnormal proliferation. These epimutations are reversible, unlike mutations, so by this mechanism it may reverse the phenotype of many cells that became cancerous epigenetically.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Epigenetic changes, as DNA methylation which is is a very stable epigenetic mark, are passed on during cell division to subsequent cell generations until they are actively erased and they are unable to return again.</span></span></p>
<p><span>A sensitive period is a time of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks, such as</span> pre-implantation development and germ cell development. Treating patients in these periods should not be advisable because <span>DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic processes such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin and it would eliminate all these epigenome features altering a correct development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are generally hypomethylated. The methylation at the promoter can predict whether or not a gene will be expressed or not. If a promoter is hypermethylated, its gene is highly unlikely to be expressed but on the other hand if it is hypomethylated doesn't mean it will be expressed for sure.</p>
<p>In cancer DNA methylation of CpG islands is increased in a locus-specific way. DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands silence tumour supressor genes, allowing the tumour to grow without control when oncogenes are being expressed. DNA methylation is maternally inheritable, so it is a very effective way of silencing tumor supressive genes because these epimutations can be rapidly selected due to the growth advantages that a cancer cell have over the surrounding normal cells.</p>
<p>In normal cell it is found that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and even in the introns of genes whereas in cancer cells the genome in general including the repetitive elements, and these intergenic elements and indeed the introns are hypomethylated. However the outcome of this feature for the cell depends on where it's found, if it is on intergenic regions it yields to genomic instability: illegitimate recombination between repeats (causing deletions, translocations or insertions), activation of repeats and transposition and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. All these processes appears to enhance tumorigenesis importantly.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated on the maternal allele and binds is insulator element, CTCF. In this case H19 will be enhanced while lgf2 won´t be expressed. On the other hand, the ICR on the paternal allele is methylated so now the enhancers can act on IGF2, because CTCF is not binded, so it is expressed. But H19 is silenced. </p>
<p>The developing of Wilm's tumour is associated with loss of imprinting at the imprint control regions of this cluster so that you have high hypermethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as on the paternal allele. Therefore on the maternal allele Igf2 is also expressed causing the affected cell to have a double dose of this protein, a growth factor, that may promote the formation of a tumour.</p></div>
