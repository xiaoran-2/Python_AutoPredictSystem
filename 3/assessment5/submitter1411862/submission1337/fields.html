    <h1>Submission 1337 from Anon (session_user_id: 71168b790ce38c8e53c378e0ac95443437234531)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can silence genes such as tumor suppressor genes or allow activation of genes which gets passed down to daughter cells while remaining intact/functional. The sensitive period is the time when the epigenetics is easily influences since all methylation/acetylation marks were removed. The sensitive period of development is early development and the primordial germ cell phase. Treating patients during the sensitive period could alter the DNA methylation completely instead of targeting one population of "marks" in cells that have hypermethylation.</p>
<p>The demethylating drugs have shown that they produce a “memory” antitumor response which is very promising.  However, some worry that it may affect the structure of chromatin which could cause side effects over a long period.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The normal function of DNA methylation in CpG islands is to control DNA replication or RNA transcription thus controlling gene expression.  When the CpG island methylation is disrupted the oncogenes get overexpresed and the tumor repressor genes become inactivated by hypermethylation and cannot help control what is happening in the cell. It may also contribute to production of non coding transcripts which can also block other gene function and contribute to the uncontrolled cell replication. The DNA methylation of CpG island contributes to disease as genes are not activated or appropriately activated thus this causes secondary issues like turning on another gene or suppressing another gene which may be critical to the normal health of the cell.</p>
<p>Intergenic region and repetitive elements are demethylated in cancer cells allowing for altered transcripts or non coding RNAs to be expressed. Disruption of the DNA methylation in the intergenic regions or repetitive elements can cause cells to over or under express necessary cellular maintenance genes with other unessential transcripts that can hang rounds causing other genes from being expressed.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Beckmann-Weidemann disease causes increased rick of cancers in children.  DNA methylation controls the reciprocal imprinting of Igf2 and H19 by preventing binding of the insulator protein CTCF.  The maternal side of the H19/Igf2 cluster expresses the H19 gene that is activated by the downstream enhancers CTCF and the same enhancer then activates the paternal side and the Igf2 gene.  The Igf2 gene is methylated at the ICR on the maternal side to keep is silenced and the H19 gene is methylated on the paternal side to keep it silenced. H19 from the maternal side activates the enhancers downstream of it then the CFCT is activated by the enhancer thus the Ifg2 gene is activated. Hypomethylation of the H19 promoter causes aberrant expression.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor which is caused by a somatic loss of imprinting as there is methylation at the ICR on both alleles and no methylation of the CTCF. Thus the H19 gene product is not produced thus CTCF is not activated and the Igf2 gene never expressed. Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to disease by germline imprint switching and thus adding or removing DNA methylation marks which then allow gene activation during blastomegensis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is in the class of drugs called DNMT inhibitors. The impact of this drug is that it causes demethylation allowing genes to be activated.</p>
<p>The anti-tumor effect that Decitabine has is that it removes the methylation from the tumor suppressor gene which allows it to produce its anti-tumor effects since the methylation was silencing the gene.  Decitabine causes depletion of DNA methyltransferase, genome-wide DNA demethylation, and robust reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.</p>
