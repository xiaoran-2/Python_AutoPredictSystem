    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are usually free of myethylation independent of activity state. In cancer this is reversed with CpG islands being hpermethylated. These methylated CpG islands generally reside in tumour suppressor genes which silences them and is also heritable through cell division. Because it is tumour suppressor genes that are affected i.e. switched off, this aberrant epigenetic mark can contribute to cancer as there is now no opposition to the expression of oncogenes. CpG island methylation progresses with time increasing as the cancer developes and contributes to tumourgenicity.This can occur in promoters in single genes or in multiple genes. A multiple gene phenotype is termed CIMP (CPI methylator phenotype). It involves a number of genes with CpG island hypermethylation which appear to have different patterns for a number of different cancers i.e. CIMP pattern for colorectal cancer is different to that of Gliomas etc.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually hypermyethylated, whose function is to provide and maintain genomic stability. This ensures against loss/gain of chromosomes, inversions and inappropriate recombinations. Instability developes because regions in seperate chromosomes that would otherwise be masked by methylation become exposed and may have a degree of identity with each other.Also, loss of methyation results in Chomatin opening up giving rise to a euchromatin-like state. This euchromatin state can result in repeats being transcribed which can then jump or transpose around the genome. their final resting place can inactivate genes if they transpose directly into them or activate genes that would normally remain silent.</p>
<p>In cancer These resgions become hypomethylated which can result in genomic instability. Studies in mouse models found that a deletion of DNMT1 in specific tissues increased genomic instability. It was found that if DNA methylation cannot occur in the specific knockout tissue cancer would develope.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the paternal allele of the Igf2/h19 cluster has its imprint control region (ICR) methylated as is the H19 gene due to heterochromatin spread from the ICR, essentially silencing it. As the ICR is methylated it cannot bind to insulator CTCF enabling enhancers to interact with Igf2 resulting in expression.</p>
<p>On the Maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated enabling it to bind CTCF. this insulates Igf2 from being expressed. The second preference for the enhancers is to interact with the maternal H19 gene.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour there is ICR methylation on both alleles and imprinting is lost, resulting in a double dose of Igf2 expression. Igf2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) is growth promoting and results in this Childhood kidney tumour. Therefor Igf2 can be described as an oncogene.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is a very early event in cancer developement. Loss of imprinting can mean either both alleles are expressed or both are silenced. Many imprinted genes are involved in aspects of growth by either promoting or suppressing it.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dectabine is an FDA approved DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitor that is used to treat myelodisplastic syndromes, the precursors to acute myelogenous leukaemia. They are nucleoside analogues that are incorporated into DNA upon replication. When DNMT1 attempts to bind it to copy DNA methylation to the daughter strand it is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released. Therefor, the action of Decitabine is division dependent and the cell must be replicating and dividing. As cancer cells divide much more rapidly than normal cells they are affected more severely. First used in the 70's at very high doses which proved to be toxic. At a much lower dose there appears to be a very good antineoplastic effect as they seem to be causing DNA methylation. Still not sure how specific they are to cancer cells relative to all dividing cell populations as well as longer term consequences.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Proper methylation is critical in all cell types and helps define cell lineages, therefor the ability to alter the aberrant methylation pattern in cancer cells would be useful. These alterations are also heritable so may persist. This may be beneficial in cancer cells as they seem to become more susceptable to standard chemotherapeutics after treatment with DNMT inhibitors, This may be because hypermethylation is reversable unlike a genetic mutation.</p>
<p>Treatment that interferes with the epigenetic machinery may have adverse affects if adminstered during a sensitive period, which can be defined as an errasing and laying down of epigenetic marks. There are two such periods. The first occurs preimplantation (the blastocyst stage) where marks are reset in a cell type specific manner. The Second sensitive period is during germ cell developement where somatic marks are removed and germ cell marks are set.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given as to whether or not epigenetic therapy should be given to young patients whose germ cells (sperm or ova) are going through this second  period. Giving a drug that can alter DNA methylation may have considerable down stream consequences for the epigenetic stability of developing germ cells and any inappropriate alterations that could result.</p>
