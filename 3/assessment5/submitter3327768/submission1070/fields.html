    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically hypomethylated in the DNA of normal cells. This allows for the expression of genes though they may or may not be expressed depending on other epigenetic controls. Hypermethylation at CpG islands inhibits the expression of the associated genes. Cancerous cells display locus specific hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes which inhibits the expression of these genes. Since the methylation of the CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes is mitotically heritable all cell divisions result in daughter cells which also have hypermethylated CpG islands and shores at tumor suppressor genes. This causes the tumor to not be suppressed since the tumor suppressor genes are not expressed and it also allows for cancerous cells to divide more rapidly than non-cancerous ones.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements helps to maintain genomic stabilty in part by inhibiting the expression of the DNA in these regions by contributing to the formation of heterochromatin which inhibits the transcription process. The DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is typically hypomethylated in cancerous cells. Hypomethylation of DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements thus allowing for their transcription which contributes to disease by causing genomic instability through illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and cryptic promoters and disruption to neighboring genes. Also CpG poor promoters are sometimes hypomethylated in cancerous cells which can result in the activation of genes that promote tumor growth by methods including increased expression of microRNA that targets tumor suppressor genes thereby decreasing the expression of the tumor suppressors themselves.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer in different ways and can be the result of either hypermethylation or hypomethylation at ICRs. These disruptions can inhibit the expression of growth restricting genes or promote the expression of growth promoting genes. In the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster the paternal allele is typically hypermethylated at the ICR, which prevents the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, allowing DNA methylation to spread to the  H19 promoter which silences H19 and allows Igf2 access to the  downstream enhancers promoting the expression of Igf2. The maternal allele is hypomethylated in these regions in normal cells which allows CTCF to bind to the ICR thus preventing Igf2 from accessing the enhancers and allowing H19 to utilize them thus promoting the expression of H19. In the cancer known as Wilm's tumor imprinting at the H19/Igfs cluster is disrupted by hypermethylation of the maternal allele, particularly at the ICR and the H19 promoters. This prevents the expression of H19 from the maternal allele and promotes the expression of Igf2 which results in an overexpression of Igf2 as it is now expressed by both the paternal and maternal alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, a drug used to treat cancer, is a DNA-demethylating agent, or DNMT inhibitor which acts to reduce DNA methylation. DNMT inhibitors reduce methylation by irreversibly binding DNMT once they have been incorporated into DNA, thereby preventing the DNMT from continuing to function. Reductions in DNA methylation could impact tumor growth by reducing hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes thus allowing for their normal expression, this would be most effective in types of cancer in which tumor suppresor gene CpG island hypermethylation is most severe. This demethylation would also be mitotically heritable meaning that it would be passed on to daughter cells indefinitely thereby creating a lasting impact on the ability of the tumor to grow. Since cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells this can reduce tumor growth by having a greater impact on the cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of treatment because the epigenetic alterations to DNA methylation are mitotically heritable which means they will be passed on to all daughter cells as long as the DNA methylation mechanisms of the cells are functioning properly. Periods of early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development are known as sensitive periods during which epigenetic marks including DNA methylation are cleared and reset. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during these periods would be inadvisable because it would interfere with the cells' ability to properly clear and reset the epigenetic marks required for normal development. These periods would include early embryonic development for both males and females and childhood through puberty for females as their primordial germ cells are still developing throughout this period.</p></div>
