    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation has a central role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. It’s an alternative to genetic mutation silencing tumour suppressor genes in cancer.</p>
<p>Normally CpG islands are unmethylated, intergenic region and repetitive elements are methylated and functioning properly contributing the normal genomic development. On the contrary, cancer cells’ CpG islands are methylated, intergenic region and repetitive elements are unmethylated and contributing in activation of abnormal genomic development or creating instability in the genome.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG islands usually remain unmethylated, allowing gene transcription and DNA methylation within the gene bodies avoids spurious transcription initiations. In cancer cells gene bodies lack this modification and transcription of many genes gets blocked and aberrant transcription may occur. In normal cells methylation of repetitive sequences prevents genomic instability and transposable elements cannot be activated in a methylated environment. In cancer cells, hypomethylation triggers genomic instability and aberrant transcription initiations and the activation of transposons may lead to gene disruption.</p>
<p>In general mutations that cause cancer can be replaced by the role of CpG island hypermethylation (single gene examples: RB, BRCA1, MGMT). Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is also often more frequent than mutations. The result is the same as the gene would have been mutated.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation in repeats and intergenic region is contributing the instability of the genome (e.g. illegitimate recombination, activation of repeats and transposition, cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes.)</p>
<p>So the two main concept of the contribution of DNA methylation to cancer are hypomethylation genome-wide and tumour suppressor hypermethylation. But different tumours have different dependencies and DNA methylation is also context dependent and stage specific too. So it’s never easy to determine whether a certain condition in DNA methylation is directly contributing to a certain cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Common features of cancer cells are they display loss of imprinting. During hypermethylation of imprint control regions genes are no longer show the imprint of expression (monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression), but they become expressed from parental alleles or silent from both parental alleles.</p>
<p>Regarding the IGF2 /H19 cluster at the imprint control region originally it’s methylated on the paternal allele, and it's unmethylated on the maternal allele. While it’s unmethylated (maternal allele) the enhancers will act on H19, but Igf2 will be silent for the maternal allele, so there is no expression. On the paternal allele the enhancers can act on IGF2, because it’s methylated. So in this case IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele. CTCF is not binding to insulate, while on maternal side is binding as an insulator element.</p>
<p>With loss of imprinting the imprinting control region become hypermethylated on the maternal allele and Igf2 will be expressed too. This double dose of Igf2 – in healthy cells it’s normally single - is responsible for the development of Wilm’s tumour.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting plays a significant role in occurrence of several tumour types – mostly in preneoplastic tissues – and it suggests that hypermethylation at the imprint control regions might be very early events in tumour genesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is essential for cell differentiation and embryonic development. „Epigenetic drugs” are chemical molecules binding specifically to epigenetic modifiers inhibiting their function. Epigenetic abnormalities – unlike mutations - are reversible, so drugs potentially cause long lasting effects on epigenetic machinery and so can potentially cure cancer. The targets of these drugs are enzymatic epigenetic regulators and proteins. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors using lower doses have a very good anti-neoplastic effect; actually they are killing the tumour cells.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in epigenetics are the periods of pre-implantation development and germ cell development. These are the two phases when epigenetic reprogramming occurs. First is preimplantation development, and the second is during primordial germ cell development. Preimplantation development is that period before the embryo implants and makes a placenta. The second phase of reprogramming is when the germ cells become, either the egg or the sperm, dependent on the sex of the embryo.</p>
<p>In preimplantation embryo development maternal and zygotic epigenetic factors play crucial roles. The process regulated genetically and epigenetically too. Phases while reprogramming occurs using „epigenetic drugs” altering DNA methylation can be both very effective against developing diseases like cancer, but quite dangerous at the same time.</p>
<p>In sensitive period taking the drug would be a very large insult and cause unpredictable result to the environment that inhibits the epigenetic machinery.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor for epigenetic cancer therapy. The result of the demethylating activity of Decitabine is that CG dinucleotides within CG islands became preferentially remethylated. Presumably transcriptional downregulation may be an important effect of Decitabine.</p>
<p>Decitabine reactivates genes otherwise suppressed by DNA promoter methylation.  Decitabine is a inhibitor for DNMTs and can also cause DNA damage, which may induce gene expression. It reverses the classic epigenetic alteration, DNA promoter methylation. In adrenocortical carcinoma cells for example it acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription.</p>
<p>Decitabine have anti-tumour effect by inhibiting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell invasion by sustained global DNA demethylation and gene reexpression. Abnormal methylation, which silences certain genes, is associated with the development of many types of tumors. Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in cancer cells may interfere with this abnormal methylation and thereby restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cell growth.</p></div>
