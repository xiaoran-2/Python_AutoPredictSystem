    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. CpGs tend to be clustered in so-called islands, typically near gene promoters, and these are usually not methylated. When they are, the gene activity is repressed. In contrast, CpGs in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements are normally methylated, helping to repress their expression.</p>
<p>In disease and with aging, these normal relationships can be increasingly reversed. Hypermethylation of promoters of normally active genes near CpGs islands can repress genes that, for example, help to suppress tumours. In contrast, hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements can destabilise the genome leading to the rapid development of more abnormalities, including the activation of oncogenes. A tipping point can be reached at which a malfunctioning cell can start reproducing out of control, forming a cancerous tumour.</p>
<p>Sometimes, aberrant epigentic methylation can be enhanced or triggered by genetic mutations in key genes that code for RNAs or proteins involved in methylating or demethylating CpGs. Consequent epigentic abnormalities can then lead to further genetic abnormalities, and so on, in a vicious circle.</p>
<p>Specific types of tumours tend to have characteristic sets of mismethylated CpGs. Identifying such biomarkers can help with diagnosis, inform treatment and improve prognosis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 gene is normally only expressed if it's reached by the influence of nearby enhancers. This is conditional upon the methylation of the H19 gene and imprint control region that are physically between the enhancers and the Igf2 gene. H19 and the ICR are normally methylated only when inherited from the father. This blocks the ICR, silences H19, and allows the enhancers to trigger expression of Igf2. The maternal ICR is normally unmethylated and can then interact with an insulator protein called CTCF. This prevents the enhancers reaching Igf2 and H19 is expressed instead.</p>
<p>So normally Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele, and H19 is expressed only from the maternal allele. In Wilm's tumour, the maternal allele is methylated like the paternal allele. As a consequence of this hypermethylation, there is double expression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter. This leads to tumours in the kidneys in affected children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a one of a class of drugs that are designed to inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferases. When a cell mitotically divides, its DNA strands are copied and methylation on the parent strand is copied to the daughter strand by DNMT variants. The drug is a nucleoside that gets built in to the daughter strand of DNA. When a DNMT comes along to bind and trigger methylation, it's bound irreversibly, preventing methylation. With further copying, rapidly reproducing tumour cells are passively demethylated. How this helps is currently unclear, but they may work by helping to reactivate tumour supressor genes.</p>
<p>The drug is approved for treating myelodysplastic syndromes leading to leukaemia, and it's under trial for other types of tumour including solid tumours.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When a cell mitotically divides, its DNA strands are copied and any methylation on the parent strand is copied to the daughter strand. So any induced change to methylation will be inherited by daughter cells, creating a persistent effect.</p>
<p>The genome would be particularly sensitive to these effects during developmental stages that involve the setting and resetting of such methylation. One such sensitive period occurs shortly after fertilisation of an egg, when pluripotent embryonic stem cells are differentially methylated in a coordinated way to produce many different types of cell lineages, such as liver cells or nerve cells; a process that's critically important for normal development. Another sensitive period occurs before birth when primordial germ cells, destined to become eggs or sperm, are developing in the fetus, and are being imprinted by methylation in ways that depend on the gender of the fetus.</p>
<p>Thus drugs affecting methylation given to a pregnant woman could prevent her unborn child from developing normally or could prevent her child from having healthy children. There is even a possiblility that there could be some unusual meiotically inheritied methylation that could affect many generations.</p></div>
