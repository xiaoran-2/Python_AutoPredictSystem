    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG sites are genome locations that contain the nucleobases cytosine and guanine, linked by a single phosphate. Such sites can be permanently methylated by the addition of a methyl group, which is associated with silencing of gene expression and plays an important role in cellular differentiation. Methylation marks are also mitotically heritable. About 80% of CpG sites are methylated in any given cell.</p>
<p>CpG islands are clusters of CpG sites that tend to be located in gene promoters. They are normally not methylated, and thus allow for gene transcription. However, CpG islands in cancer cells have abnormally high (and increasing) levels of methylation, particularly in oncogenes such as tumor suppressing genes whose silencing both cause and exacerbate cancer. The type of cancer that develops is determined by the specific set of genes that are silenced. CpG island hypermethylation is also associated with a range of other diseases, by silencing genes that are necessary for the normal functioning of the organism.</p>
<p>CpG sites are also typically found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements. Such sites are normally hypermethylated, and play an important role in genome stability. In cancer cells, however, these CpGs are hypomethylated early on, which leads to a range of abnormalities such as illegitimate chromosome recombinations when hypomethylated repeats cause incorrect metaphase alignment, gene overexpression due to chromatin loosening, and transcription errors due to transposon activation. These abnormalities will lead to cancer when they affect the expression of oncogenes, but can also cause a range of other diseases by interfering with gene expression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster consists of the genes H19 and Igf2, both of which seem to be growth factors, as well as a set of CpG sites and enhancers. The CpG sites are imprinted during embryonic development in such a way that that the maternal allele is hypomethylated, while the paternal allele is hypermethylated.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the hypomethylated CpG sites allow the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the complex. This insulator blocks the enhancers from accessing the Igf2 gene, silencing its expression, but allowing for expression of H19.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, the CpG hypermethylation blocks CTCF from binding, which allows the enhancers to access Igf2 so that it is expressed. The CpG islands in the H19 promoter are also hypermethylated, which leads to its silencing.</p>
<p>If the maternal allele somehow gets hypermethylated, Igf2 will be expressed from both alleles while H19 will be completely silenced. Overexpression of Igf2 is associated with abnormal growth, which leads to Wilm's tumour. In the opposite situation, when the paternal allele is incorrectly hypomethylated, Igf2 will be silenced and H19 will be overexpressed, which is associated with breast adenocarcinoma.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is very stable, and inherited during mitosis. This makes sense, given that DNA methylation plays a large role in cell differentiation, which clearly would not be viable otherwise. Initial methylation marks are laid down symmetrically on both DNA strands, and after replication each hemi-methylated replica is processed by the DNMT1 enzyme, which duplicates the methylation mark on the opposing strand. DNMT1 also maintains methylation marks, by recovering any marks that may be lost.<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> Drug-induced epigenetic modifications will therefore persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">During early embryonic development, however, there is a need to remove any DNA methylation marks to allow the cells to revert back to stem cells, and then lay down new DNA methylation marks to achieve cell differentiation. This is called a sensitive period, and also happens during development of the primordial germ cells. Any drugs that affect DNA methylation should therefore not be given to pregnant women, especially early in the pregnancy, as it can lead to abnormalities in the development of the fetus, or in the child's offspring.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibiting hypomethylating agent<span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">. </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">It is a cytidine nucleoside analog which gets incorporated into DNA during DNA replication. When DNMT binds to daughter strands in order to duplicate methylation marks (to enable mitotic inheritance of the epigenome), Decitabine will irreversably bind the DNMT enzyme and halt its operation. This leads to a decrease in overall methylation for every cell division, and since cancer tumors both rely on hypermethylation for growth and undergo rapid cell division they will be more adversely affected than other tissues.</span></p></div>
