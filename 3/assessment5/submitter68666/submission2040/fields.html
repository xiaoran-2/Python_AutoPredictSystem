    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer processes alter the methylation pattern of the tumor suppressor genes. In normal cells there is the mutilation of CpG islands and genes are expressed, suppressing the occurrence of tumors. In cancer cells a hypermethylation of CpG islands which prevents the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Disruption of methylation pattern of CpG islands in preventing the expression of these genes suppressors. Also altered expression in ICR, hypomethylation and hypermethylation therefore causes a reduction of the expression of growth Restricting genes or increased expression Promoting growth genes.<br /> The mutilation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements provides stability to genes, preventing or making it less likely the occurrence of abnormalities in the karyotype, as insertions, deletions or reciprocal translocations. Hypomethylation, anywhere in the genome, causes instability and increases the likelihood of karyotype abnormalities which lufar give the appearance of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal growing cells, expressed genes H19 and Igf2. H19 is produced by the maternal allele that is not methylated at several places upstream from the H19 gene, while if the paternal allele is methylated, so it is not expressed but Igf2 H19 yes. If an imprinting disruption, there is upstream of the H19 gene mutilation in the maternal allele and this gene is not expressed, is expressed instead Igf2, just as occurs in the paternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an agent DNA-demethylating and acts by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme EZH2, which is involved in histone methylation. Decitabine to inhibit the enzyme from the histones methylating allowed to decrease the degree of mutilation. Excessive a mutilation prevents the expression of tumor suppressor genes, the Decitabine acts against excessive methylation of histones and allows tumor suppressor genes can act.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation are maintained for long in the cells transmitted from the offspring. There are certain times in which it is easier to remove cell methylation. In these times it is easier to get good results in treatment</p></div>
