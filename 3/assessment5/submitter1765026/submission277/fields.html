    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal function of DNA methylation there isn't methylation at CpG islands. It's found in the intergenic regions and the repeats of the genome. In cancer, DNA methylation is much more prevelent at CpG islands and the surrounding shores of the DNA. The DNA methylation at CpG islands is a hallmark of cancer tumors. Scientists use the methylation in diagnosis and treatment of cancer. When the CpG islands are methylated it may silence tumor supressor genes usually activated and keep tumors at bay. This methylation may be on of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis. When these CpG islands and surrounding shores are methylated it allows cancer cells to grow unregulated. It becomes invasive to surrounding tissues. When these CpG island are normally active and now are methylated and silenced it throws these mechanisms into a disrupted state. DNA methylation is mitoitcally heritable. When the intergenic regions and repeats are the methylated areas of the genome then the cells behave normally for cell maintenance, repair, and tumor growth supression. When the intergenic regions and the repeats area are not methylated it leads to genomic instability. Methylation in these regions keep the chromatin packaged tightly and keeps them in order. Genomic instability may lead to activation of cryptic promotors and disrupts neighboring genes normally silenced. It also may cause illigitimate recombination between the repeats.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal function of the H19/Igf2 cluster this is paternally imprinted. This cluster is linked to to growth restriction/ promoting genes. On the paternal allele the H19 lncRNA and the CTCF is methylated allowing the H19 to be active only on the maternal allele. CTCF is an insulator protein that insulates the Igf2 from downstream enhancers. When DNA methylation at the ICR it block the binding of the CTCF. If the methylation on the maternal allele occurs then H19 doesn't work downstream. In the case where both alleles are methylated then Wilm's tumor can occur as Igf2 is upregulated and tumor growth is unregulated. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT drug. DNMT- DNA Methyltransferase, it demethylates DNA. When there is hypermethylation as in cancer there is unregulated growth of tumors and cell maintenance. When the demethylation occurs with this drug then the genes silenced by the methylation are activated and suppress the cancer. Epigenetic mutations are reversible, when the demethylation from this drug occur it allows the mechanisms to work correctly. When the genes are unmethylated then the tumor supressor genes are allowed to block tumor growth and normal cell maintenace is allowed to occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When DNA methylation occurs and is not cleared it can have lasting effects on the genome. It allows genomic instability and can lead to systemic disorders. There can be multiple issues where chromosome don't recombine correctly and cause greated mutations.</p>
<p>A senstivie period is a period in the life cycle when PGC - primordial germ cell are developed and can be impacted or during early embryonic development. For example ill effects from prepubertal smoking aged 9-12.</p>
<p>Treating patients during a sensitive period can have lasting effects on generations of the patients offspring to come. There may not be a lasting effect on the patient themself but their offspring may feel the effects due to epigenetic changes due to the drug delivery.  The offspring may develop disorders due to the drugs effects on the patient. They may have disorders like diabetes or obesity.  </p>
