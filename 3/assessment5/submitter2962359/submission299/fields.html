    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two well-explored mechanisms by which DNA mismethylation contributes to tumor growth: Hypermethylation of CpG islands of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, proliferation and tumor suppression and a general, genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>
<p>CpG islands, i.e. repeats of cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides exist in more than half of currently described promoters; moreover, the activity of these promoters has been shown to correlate inversely with the amount of methylation. Thus, in a normal somatic cell, some promoters’ CpG islands will be methylated so that proteins are not expressed, while most others will not be methylated in order to maintain expression levels.</p>
<p>In many cancer cells, including colorectal, breast cancer and glioma, it has been found that CpG islands in promoters for proteins involved in tumor suppression and regulation are hypermethylated. This causes the expression level of these proteins to decrease, which in turn leads to less control of proliferation and cell growth and can contribute to tumor growth.</p>
<p>The genome-wide hypomethylation is a large change especially observed in later stage cancer cells that has a multitude of effects. One of these is the hypomethylation of intragenic regions and repeating sequences. These regions often provide the information for different noncoding RNA sequences: long intragenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), PIWI-interacting (piRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA).</p>
<p>The concentration of these RNAs in the cell is tightly controlled by epigenetic markings such as DNA methylation, as many of these non-coding RNA strands play crucial roles in maintaining nuclear structure and regulate hetero- and euchromatin composition. If regulation of transcription of these strands is compromised, nuclear architecture is disrupted, which has been observed as a characteristic of cancer cells for one and a half centuries and is known to cause aberrant cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the main connecting characteristics in imprint regions, which are transmitted and copied from parent alleles. An example of such an imprinted region, alterations of which are correlated with pluripotency and pluripotent-like cancer cells is the H19/Igf2 cluster. In a normal cell, the paternal allele is methylated in the promoter region of H19 as well as in the CTCF binding region, whereas the maternal allele is unmethylated. This causes suppression of H19 in the paternal allele and suppression of Igf2 through binding of the CTCF repressor in the maternal allele. This mechanism specifically controls the expression levels of Igf2 and H19. As this cluster is an ICR and controls the expression of several different genes and non-coding sequences, an alteration of the epigenetic control of this region can have adverse effects on cell cycle regulation and cause tumourigenesis. This is exactly what happens in Wilm’s tumour: hypermethylation leads to methylation of the maternal allele, which causes overexpression of Igf2 and suppression of H19. Such an imbalance of important controlling factors in the cell is probably one of the leading contributors to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As there are a multitude of epigenetic processes, a multitude of drugs are being developed that can interrupt or redirect them. This opens up epigenetically tailored treatment options for cancer depending on the epigenetic factor that is out of control. One such drug which is already currently available is Decitabine, a DNA demethylating agent used against myelodysplastic syndromes, a pre-tumour stage of myelogenous leukemia. The drug can demethylate DNA, especially where it is accessible to outside influences – for instance if a previously unmethylated CpG island of a promoter is methylated due to a genetic mutation. As the hypermethylation of promoters in a few specific genes is observed often in early stages of cancer, demethylation of genes suppressed in the cancer could lead to reexpression of regulatory proteins and reestablishment of DNA repair machinery or even apoptosis of the cancer cell.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic markings, including DNA methylation, are usually mitotically heritable, i.e. a cell dividing itself will pass on epigenetic as well as genetic information. If a drug alters the DNA methylation pattern due to demethylation, or inhibits methylation before meiosis, the epigenetic markings will be altered in future cell generations as well as in the current one. Next to opening up interesting synergistic options for treating cancer, this unfortunately also means that processes in which epigenetic marks are established naturally can be disrupted – which is usually not a problem in somatic cells, in which epigenetic marks are only perpetuated through division, not established anew. This is only the case sensitive periods, in which epigenetic imprintings are developed. Two main sensitive periods, are the production of gametes and gestation. As treating patients with epigenetic drugs during this time may cause their children to have incorrect imprintings, which can lead to embryonic misdevelopment and severe retardations in the unlikely scenario that the embryo survives. For the purposes of treatment, it would thus be inadvisable to treat pregnant or nursing women or children of either generation until puberty is over unless the threat of misimprinting is understood and taken into consideration.</p></div>
