    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>CpGs are generally methylated in Intergenic regions and repetitive elements genome wide and unmethylated at CpGs islands where they group in clusters upstream of gene promoters.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>When CpG islands are normally methylated, they silence gene expression by suppress gene promoters. In cancer cells, CpG Islands preceding tumour suppressing gene promoters and shore regions are often increasingly hypermethylated which cause the silence of the tumour suppressing gene and lead to continuous cell division. The epigenetic trait is inherited by daughter cells through mitosis and therefore lead to spreading of the daughter cells and evade healthy cells which causes disease.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>The DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated in normal cells to maintain genomic stability. The repeats in cancer cells are hypomethylated therefore not densely packaged into hetero-chromosomes. They misalign and cause illegitimate recombination between repeats on different chromosomes which leads to reciprocal translocations. The repeats can also be activated due to hypomethylation, they make copies of themselves and jump around the genome or transpose. This may cause disruption of a gene's coding region and may lead to activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. The result may be deletion, insertion or reciprocal translocations, which causes genomic instability that leads to cancer. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters is lesson common than hypomethylation of repeats, and can lead to activation of genes. which would lead to disease if these genes are related to cancer or other diseases depend on the context and the stage of the disease development.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Disruption of imprinting can occur from either hypomethylation or hypermethylation which lead to cancer. In the H19/Igf2 cluster of normal cells, the imprint control region is methylated on the paternal allele, CTCF is not binding to the ICR to insulate it, therefore the enhancers are acting on Igf2 gene and it is expressed. On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, CTCF bind this insulator element and the enhancers will act on H19 gene and Igf2 gene is silenced.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>In Wilm's tumour the ICRs on both alleles are hypermethylated and therefore there're double expression of the Igf2 gene and no expression of the H19 gene. Igf2 is growth promoting and is associated with Wilm's tumour - childhood kidney tumour. Disruption of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster occurs as a very early event, often seen in preneoplastic tissues, this suggest that these events are early events in tumour regenesis which lead to the disease.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent, it<span> hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. It<span> is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue which can be used as a substitude for cytidine deoxynucleoside. First, decitabine is converted into decitabine triphosphate,  then it is incorporated into the DNA to block the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are the enzymes that catalyze <span>the transfer of a methyl group</span><span> to DNA</span>. By blocking DNMTs, decitabine will block the DNA methylation that promotes cancer and division of tumour cells.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The altered epigenetic trait is passed on to daughter cells through mitosis thus having enduring effects on the epigenome. I would avoid treating patients with epigenetic drugs during the sensitive periods. A sensive period is a period when the genome goes through epigenetic reprogramming where DNA methylation are demethylated and remethylated to remove and re-establish epigenetic marks. There are two sensitive periods in human development: the early development and PGC development periods. Reprogramming in early development <span>is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes from parental germ cells.</span> Reprogramming during primordial germ cells development period,<span> the primordial germ cells must have their original biparental genomic imprinting marks</span><span> erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent everytime they pass through the germline. It is inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods because the drugs that alter DNA methylation have long lasting effects beyond the period of drug treatment and can lead to disorders in epigenetic regulation which can lead to other diseases.</span></p></div>
