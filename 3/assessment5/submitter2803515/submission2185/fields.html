    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands are unmethylated. In cancer cells CpG islands become abnormally hypermethylated. This hypermethylation occurs generally in the promoter genes and causes therefore gene inactivation. The genes that are affected by this process and that mostly contribute to cancer are the tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements there is normally DNA methylation present. In cancer these regions get hypomethylated. These in turn lead to genomic instability (like illegitimate recombinations, activation of repeats and transpositions, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.)</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele at this ICR is normally hypermethylated and lgf2 is active. The maternal allele is not methylated. Therefore CTCF is able to bind to this ICR and block the enhancers to reach the lgf2 gene. This means the gene is silent at the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor the ICR at both the paternal and maternal alleles is methylated. CTFC is unable to bind to the ICRs and therefore the enhancer at both allele's can reach the lgf2 gene. This results in being the lgf2 expressed in both alleles. lgf2 overexpression can result in overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is considered a "DNA-demethylating agent". It works by inhibiting methylation and this results in a less methylated state. This in turn would lead to expression of formerly silent genes. Especially if the re-expressed genes are tumor suppressor genes, this can have a positive impact on cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As expressed by Dr. Baylin, unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased (Note that DNA methylation is mitotically heritable). Once erased, though, they do not return.</p>
<p align="left">Sensitive periods are periods of time where epigenetic reprogramming occurs and envirnmental effects can have a direct effect on the epigenome. Germ cell development and early embryonic development stages are the sensitive periods of development. Treating patients during these periods would be inadvisable because drugs that alter DNA-methlation could have unwanted side-effects during epigenetic reprogramming. For example if using a DNA-demethylating drug, repeats that normally are methylated and should stay so, could become hypomethylated which would result in genomic instability.</p>
