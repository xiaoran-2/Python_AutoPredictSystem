    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylase, an enzyme that removes methyl (CH3) groups from DNA.  Methyl groups are one of the many ways in which transcription is regulated within an organism's genome.  By removing methyl groups from the DNA, the transcription of genes can be upregulated or increased.  Some cases of cancer are caused by the silencing of tumor suppressor genes, genes that typically control cell growth, by the methylation of the DNA that codes for these genes.  By using Decitabine, these genes can be "un-silenced" or turned on by removing the methyl groups, resulting in control/destruction of the tumor.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG sites are areas of the genome in which the bases cytosine and guanine are located next to each other.    Such sites can be methylated, the attachment of a methyl (CH3) group, by the protien 5-methylcytosine.  If a particulare stretch of DNA has a greater frequency of these sites, that area is called a CpG island.<span> Typically, CpG islands occur in gene promoter areas and play a role in the regulation of transcription.  When methylated, these islands block transcription of the gene by recruiting specific classes of proteins (MBDs or Methyl Binding Domain Proteins) that further attract other proteins that alter the chromatin structure, altering transcription rates.  In normal functioning, CpG islands are rarely methylated.  In cancer, it has been found that these CpG are hypermethylated, effectively silencing the gene.  If a class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes is silenced in this way, this can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells or tisssue, i.e. cancer. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>CpG sites also play a part in gene regulation in the parts of the genome where they are less frequent.  These sites are often found in intergenic regions and at repetitive repeats.  These sites are often methylated in normal tissue.  It is beleived that the methylation of repetitive elements sites protects genetic stability.  For example, when repetitive elementss are unmethylated, these sites can recombine in ways that result in chormosome deletions, duplications or even swapping of DNA between two chormosomes.  These repetitive elements can also be copied and inserted into other areas of the genome, possibly in the middle of genes, disrupting the fuction of these genes.   If the wrong gene is deleted, damaged due to translocation or insertion of repetitive elements, disease can occur, spefically cancer if tumor suppressor genes are affected.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is inheritable, meaning that DNA methylation patterns of a cell will be passed on to the daughter cells during cell division.  This inheritance continues through the cell line unless otherwised\ changed.  Thus, any changes to DNA methylation patterns caused by the adminitration of drugs will be effective for multiple generations of cells.  During the life cycle there is two times that the epigenome undergoes major reprogramming: the formation of gametes and the development of the blastocyst.  Gametes undergo epigenetic reprogramming so as to rid these cells of the somatic marks that are not needed and could interfere with the gametes functions.  During development, the somatic cell marks are reset in the blastocyst for proper cell function. These periods are especially sensitive because any interruption of the reprogramming could result in improper creation of epigenetic marks, resulting in loss of proper genome functioning and disease.  If one were to treat patients with drugs that are known to alter epigenetic marks during these periods of development, one would disrupt this reprogramming and imprinting, likely resulting in epigeneitc disease.  This can be inferred from the issues seen with assisted reproductive technology, the greater occurrence of imprinting errors seen in these groups.  </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprint control region found on chromosome 11 that shows parent-of-origin inheritance patterns in its epigenetic patterns.  This cluster is made up of the Igf2 gene, the imprint control region (ICR), the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and an enhancer section further downstream.  The ICR is methylated on the paternal strand while the ICR on the maternal strand attracts a protein called CTCF.  On the paternal strand the methylation of the ICR allows the enhancer region to activate the Igf2 gene, a gene involved in growth, while the CTCF binded ICR region on the maternal strand blocks the enhancers from acting on the Igf2 gene.  In this case, the enhancers then access the H19 lncRNA.  When this imprinting pattern goes wrong and the maternal strand instead acts like the paternal strand resulting in increased activation of the Igf2 gene, this results in the disease known as Beckwith-Weidemann Syndrome. The phenotype of this disease includes fetal and natal over-growth, large tongue, and childhood, tumors such as Wilm's tumor, a tumor of kidney.   </p></div>
