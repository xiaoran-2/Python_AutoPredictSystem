    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands are generally unmethylated (or hypomethylated), while the intergenic region, repetitive element, and gene are generally methylated. In this state, the tumor suppression genes would be active. In contrast, in cancer cells the reverse is true; the CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, while the other regions tend to be hypomethylated. This silences the tumor supression genes, and since methylation state is mitotically heritable, the daughter cells will also have hypomethylated CpG Islands, allowing tumors to grow. For this reason, DNA methylation is a good at maintaining the status quo (allowing tumors to grow by suppressing tumor suppressing genes), and may serve as one of the "hits" described in the Knudson hypothesis. In normal cells, the intergenic and repetitive elements help contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability. In part this is because these areas are in heterochomatin, so are somewhat "protected." In cancer cells, there is increased probabililty of reciprical translocations due to the hypomethylation of the repetitive elements, since there are more likely to be lengths of DNA that are similar between two chromosomes, which could then "swap" during recombination. With hypomethylation of the repeats, it is also possible that they will make extra copies and "jump" to different parts of the genome, causing disruption of the gene where it ends up. Deletions and insertons are another possibility. Since the intergenic regions and repetitive elements have strong promoters, other downstream genes will be abnormally activated by the promoters when they are hypomethylated. Overall, the hypomethylation of the intergenic regions and repetitive elements causes genomic instability; these alterations then cause abnormal DNA transcription and expression leading to aberrant and potentially harmful genes (or newly formed gene sequences), and disruption of the expression of protective genes, which can lead to tumor formation and disease progression.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug (referred to in the lectures as DNA methyl transferase (DNMT) inhibitors or DNMTi. It is a nucleoside analog, meaning that it can incorporate itself into the DNA. It then irreversibly binds DNMT, and prevents it from copying the current methylation state to the daughter cell. It requires cell division/replication to be effective (since that's how it keeps the methylation profile from being passed on), but since cancer cells divide more rapidly than other cells, it can be effective in decreasing tumor size (or inhibiting growth). At this point it it unclear whether the DNMTi's work on just tumor cells, or are affecting all cells (most likely the latter), so the effects may be more general than just on the tumors. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Because DNA methylation is passed down to daughter cells, DNA methylation in one cell could ultimately lead to methylation in millions of subsequent cells. DNA methylation has been shown to have effects on cell division and embryonic development, and helps in mediating gene expression. For this reason, one would want to be very careful when treating anyone currently in a sensitive period. In the context of epigenetics, a sensitive period is a period of development where tissue is susceptible to environmental signals, including in early development and germ cell development, when maternal and paternal genomes are demethylated and reset. In addition, sensitive periods have also been identified in other areas of research (e.g., neuroscience), where there is significant development of different organs (e.g., brain maturation at puberty). It would be inadvisable, therefore, to treat patients in these times of life where altering the epigenetic machinery could cause very significant alterations in normal development of tissue, but also in the subsequent tissue (as described above) throughout the life of the patient.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprinted control region of the H19/Igf2 cluster is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele.  Because the maternal control region is unmethylated, it binds the insulator protein, CTCF, which means that it insulates Igf2 (upstream) from downstream enhancers, so the enhancers act on H19 (which is downstream from the control region) instead. As a result Igf2 is not expressed from the maternal allele. Because the paternal control region is methylated, CTCF can't bind and DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter region, blocking the expression of H19, so the enhancers can then act on Igf2, and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. Because H19 is a growth inhibitor, and Igf2 is a growth promoter, if the maternal allele is not expressed adequately, there will be abnormal growth. In Wilm's tumor, there is a loss of imprinting, causing both alleles to show paternal expression (though this can also occur if only one allele is inherited and it is from the paternal side). This leads to greatly increased expression of Igf2, resulting in overgrowth of tissue, and thus the tumor.</p>
