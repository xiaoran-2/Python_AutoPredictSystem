    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a biochemical process (adding of a methyl group to the cytosine or adenine in the DNA). Almost exclusively occurs at CpG dinucleotides in mammals. It is symmetrical, so it is able to be maintained through cell division. It is important for genomic stability. Methylation at CpG islands is associated with silencing of gene expression because the formation of a repressive chromatin structure, and can prohibit transcription factor binding, and alter gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation (e.g. tumor suppressor gene).</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of transcriptional proteins to the gene, and methylated DNA may be bound by proteins. Those proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as histone deacetylases and other chromatin remodeling proteins that can modify histones, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 has been implicated in Rett syndrome; and methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer.</p>
<p>In healthy tissue, CpG islands are usually unmethylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This is important for maintain genomic integrity because silencing of repeats and mutation of the repeats prevent transposition, silencing of repeats is important to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters, and methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</p>
<p>In cancer is a genome wide lack of methylation. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions or repetitive elements are associated with genomic instability, which can lead to illegitimate recombination between repetitive elements, activation of repetitive elements and transposition, and activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 is a gene for a long noncoding RNA, found in humans. Genomic imprinting is surmised to have arisen due to the conflicting interests of maternal and paternal genes within a pregnancy. CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2<em> </em>from downstream enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19<em> </em>promoter to silence and enhancers can access Igf2<em> </em>to activate. This imprinting control region is differentially methylated at its CpGs according to parental inheritance. Usually, the paternal copy of H19 is methylated and silent, so there is expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>Maternal copy of H19 is hypomethylated or unmethylated and expressed in the offspring cell, but there is no expression of Igf2. Methylation of the H19 promoter is negatively correlated with Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>Imprinted disorder, results from various abnormalities in H19<em>/</em>Igf2<em> </em>cluster. If maternal copy of H19 is hypermethylated and expressed in the offspring cell, there is overexpression of Igf2 what lead to Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>Loss of DNA methylation at ICRs is common in cancer. Aberrant expression of imprinted genes results in specific diseases. Each cluster has at least one ICR, which displays differential methylation established in primordial germ cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. It is nuceloside analogue, irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA, and is replication dependent. Large number of genes found to undergo hypermethylation in various malignancies. Decitabine can derepress silenced tumor suppressor genes and restore their normal function. Decitabine contains a deoxyribose group, and it is incorporated into DNA. DNA methylation helps to maintain transcriptional silence in nonexpressed or noncoding regions of the genome. Hypermethylation can induce inevitable alterations in gene expression. Decitabine are powerful inhibitor of DNA methylation. Decitabine is active in patients with hematopoietic malignancies and cause the demethylation of important genes. Effect of demethylation is not stable, and the hypermethylated state and gene silencing recur upon cessation of drug treatment. Therapy maintenance with methylation inhibitor such as decitabine is necessary to ensure continued transcriptional derepression. Decitabine used alone or in combination, have clinical benefit in many patients with hematologic malignancies.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Epigenetic changes are heritable changes in gene expression that do not result from alterations in the gene nucleotide sequence. DNA demethylation occurs in early development, in primordial germ cell development and at later specific stages of differentiation. Sensitive periods predominantly during establishment of epigenetic marks, rather than maintenance. Sensitive periods are during embryogenesis and gametogenesis (puberty), when epigenetic marks are established.</p>
<p>Epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. The idea of epigenetic therapy is to stay away from killing the cell.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods it is not advisable because during that time all epigenetic marks are erased, and the new one are reestablished during sensitive period. If we use epigenetic drugs during that time, genes that should be methylated probably wouldn’t be and they would be active. It wouldn’t occur epigenetic silencing through methylation of genes that should be silenced because of drugs. </p></div>
