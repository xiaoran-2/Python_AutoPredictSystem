    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpGs are hypomethiliated, on the contrast in cancer cells CpGs are hypermethiliated.In that way the tummor suppresion genes become silenced.This results in giving the cancer cells advantage over the surrounding cells so that the are able to divide faster and not die. I normal cells the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methyliated, but in cancer cells these areas are hypomethyliated.This leads to genomic instabilty and causes illegimate recombination between repetitive elements.It can also cause activation of criptic promoters and disruption to neightbouring genes. In addition hypomethyliaton of CpG poor promoters can lead to activation of genes such r-ras with is found in gastric cancer.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This example is a result of hypermethyliation of imprint control regions in both paternal and maternal allele which cause over-production of igf2(which leads to wilms tummor)</p>
<p>In normal cells the imprint control region of the paternal allele is methyliated. As a result the CFTF cant bind it, so the enhancers act on igf2 and cause the production of igf2 and H19 is silenced.</p>
<p>In normal cells the imprint control region of the maternal alllele is not methyliated.As a result the CFTF bind it, so the enhancers act on H19 and silence igf2.</p>
<p>In Willms tummor on the other hand both the maternal and paternal allele are methyliated.This causes the expresion of igf2 in both alleles and the production of double dose igf2, which is a growth promoting factor assosiated with Willms tummor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor. Decitabine as a nucleoside analogue it gets incoporated into the DNA uppon replication, therefore tumor cells which are replicated more, may be affected more, than the healthy cells because tumor cells are replecated faster . When the DNA methyltransferase comes to bind to the nucleotide with decitabine in order to copy the methyliation to the daughter strand the dna methyltransferase is irrevesibly bound and can no longer be released. So decitabine cause dna demethyliation in tumor cells.</span></p></div>
