    <h1>Submission 2139 from Anon (session_user_id: e8409e44b62cc2bee2a7e712d207a9b817c47651)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class of demethylating agents, which are compounds that can inhibit methylation, resulting in the expression of previously hypermethylated genes. Decitabine works by binding to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are the enzymes that catalyse the methylation reaction, and titrate out these enzymes. A number of studies suggest that DNMT genes are frequently overexpressed in cancer, causing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by aberrant DNA hyper-methylation. Thus, the use of the epigenetic drug Decitabine reduces the aberrant DNA hyper-methylation caused by DNMT overexpression in some cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because, unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Thus epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive epigenetic period is a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulator effects of epigenetic mechanisms. Early life, i.e. the developing fetus and neonate, is a period extremely sensitive to environmental perturbation and epigenetic alterations because reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization. Also, abnormal conditions such as stress, famine or excessive food consumption around adolescence, seem to have an effect, not just on the present epigenetic pattern of the individual, but also on subsequent generations because gametogenesis is still under way.  </p>
<p>Apart from the unknown side effects that the systemic administration of epigenetic drugs can have on different tissues, treating patients during gametogenesis can spread epigenetic alterations on subsequent generations. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, which are found in about 60% of promoters, have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state. However, in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. This causes on the one hand deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Unusually high frequency of DNA methylation at CpG rich sites (CIMP, CpG island methylator phenotype) is associated with diverse clinicopathological characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor location, microsatellite instability, genetic mutations, and allows for a sub-classification of tumors and determines metastatic potential. Another target of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer are CpG island shores, defined as approximately 2 kb regions surrounding CpG islands, which represent regions of tissue specific methylation in normal tissues. Methylation of shore regions is related to gene expression and has also been detected in different tumor cell lines and nerve sheath tumors.</p>
<p>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA. Gene body methylation is present in highly expressed genes and it has been speculated that this may repress transcriptional noise from alternative start sites, inhibit antisense transcription or direct RNA splicing and relates to replication timing. Hypomethylation at satellite repeats have been detected in some malignant tumors using a genome-wide approach. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19-Igf2 locus is subject to genomic imprinting. The H19 locus produces a 2.5-kb noncoding, spliced, and polyadenylated RNA of yet-unknown function. The Igf2 gene encodes a fetal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 2. These two genes are located 90 kb apart and are oppositely imprinted: in normal cells, H19 is maternally expressed and Igf2 paternally expressed. The imprinting of Igf2 and H19 is controlled by a region located 4 kb upstream from the H19 transcription unit, defined as the H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) or imprinting control region (ICR). This imprinted domain is methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele and linked to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), which is characterized by overgrowth phenotypes of affected children as well as a predisposition to develop embryonal tumors such as Wilm’s tumor or rhabdomyosarcomas.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, biallelic expression of IGF2 has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in IGF2. The maternal chromosome reverses to a paternal epigenotype, with a paternal pattern of methylation of the H19 promoter, IGF2 turned on, and H19 turned off, causing increased cell growth. </p></div>
