    <div class="field-value"><p>In DNA there are many different regions; some of these  - interested in epigenetic methylation - are: CpG islands or CGI, intergenic intervals and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>CGI, constituted by sequences of clustered CpGs that are often related to promoters of gene expression,  normally are hypomethylated. Their normal methylation, that involve silencing of specific gene expression, occours in X inactivation. Silencing is lead by 2 mechanisms:</p>
<p>-formation of a repressive chromatin structure  by association of meCpG with MeCP1&amp;2  proteins;</p>
<p>-interdiction of transcription factor binding.</p>
<p>In cancer there are regions of hypermethylated CGI and in general these are found in promoters of tumor suppressor. Different sets imply different cancer type; in literature this phenomenon is called CGI methylator phenotype or CIMP.</p>
<p>Methylation is mitotically heritable so, silencing a tumor suppressor, the cell gain a competitive advantage over the others with more rapid division and/or apoptosis delay, so may become a tumoral cell.</p>
<p>Intergenic intervals and repetitive elements normally are methylated and this is necessary to maintain genomic integrity: cells not containing DNA methyltransferase-1 present genomic instability.</p>
<p>In intergenic intervals methylation is not blocking the expression of genes via silencing traditional promoter but rather silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites so trascriptional interferences are blocked.</p>
<p>Repetitive elements - 50 and more percent of DNA - are trasposons that past themselves into somewhere else in the genome; this pasting can either be from a copy or a cut of element. This pasting or cutting obviously may be mutagenic.</p>
<p>In cancer intergenic intervals and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated, so we see hypomethylation in genome as whole.</p>
<p>Consequecence is genomic instability: in DNA are present deletions, insertions, duplications and/or translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR) have clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in primordial germ cell development - not in early embryonic development. They have different mechanism of action depending on cluster, so their methylation is not synonymous of gene silencing but rather indicate if gene is maternally or paternally imprinted.</p>
<p>H19/Igf2 cluster, that is on human chromosome 11, is controlled by enhancer blocking mechanism; this cluster normally it is unmethylated on the maternal allele and methylated on the paternal allele: this means that it's paternally imprinted.</p>
<p>In paternal allele, methylation of cluster blocks binding of CTCF (that is an insulator protein and insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers). Without CTCF, enhancers can access Igf2 to activate him; furthermore methylation of ICR spreads to H19 promoter to silence.</p>
<p>In maternal allele, cluster is not methylated, so binding of CTCF is not blocked, Igf2 is insulated and enhancers are now free to act on H19 and enhance H19 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor - a kidney tumor interesting embryos or childs, not adult - is present hypermethylation of maternal allele of ICR related to Igf2, so there is a double dose of Igf2 factor and consequent loss of growth control.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mammals, DNA methylation of CpG dinucleotide occours with intervent of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzimes. DNMT3A and DNMT3B lay down methylation of CpG dinucleotide in de novo fashion. Because these dinucleotides are symmetrical respect the other strand of DNA, methylation occours on both strand. In cell division, when DNA is replicated, only the parent strand maintains the methyl group and so there is an unmethylated cytosine in both cell, parent and daughter.</p>
<p>Correct methylation occurs with another enzime, DNMT1, that is specific for hemi-methylated DNA. In this way methylation is mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a  DNA methyltransferase inhibitor: this drug blocks the DNMT1 enzime so it is a hypomethylation agent.</p>
<p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS); MDS presents hypermethylation of CpG islands, and this is contrasted blocking DNMT1. This drug is very toxic and to have anti-neoplastic effect must used at very far lower doses.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, so alterations of methylation has enduring effects on epigenome; effects that are present for entire life of organism. At moment we don't know if these alterations - mitotically heritable - may be transgenerationally transmitted, but we know that epigenetic alterations may be transgenerationally transmitted if they occur in sensitive periods of life.</p>
<p>These periods are during the two phases of epigenetic reprogramming: the first phase is during preimplantation development, when there are rapid and active demethylation of paternal genome and passive demethylation of maternal genome. Imprinted genes are not interested in this period. The second phase is during primordial germ cell development with differential resetting in spermatogenesis and oogenesis.</p>
<p>Therefore, during sensitive periods, treatment with epigenetic drugs may cause involuntary possible transgenerational effects and, when possible, would be inadvisable.</p></div>
