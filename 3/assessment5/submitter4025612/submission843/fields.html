    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation at CpG islands is generally involved in the silencing of a gene. It may be in the promoter or around it or anywhere in the reading frame(structural gene). CpG islands in a normal cell are generally hypomethylated to allow normal gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, CpG island are more likely to be hypermethylated in a locus-specific manner, like suppressing the tumor suppressor genes (Eg:-Retinoblastoma protein RB) to promote tumor. These epimutations are more in number than genetic mutations, common genome-wide and  increase with age. CIMP(CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) involves methylation of sets of CpG islands in different genes.</p>
<p>CpG island hypermethylation and gene silencing are common in tumors as they are mitotically heritable. Epimutations are also rapidly selected as they provide survival advantage. They are also, unlike mutations, reversible, and hence can me undone when (or if) required for therapy. Some diseases caused involve Retinoblastoma etc.)</p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypermethylated to prevent transposition, cryptic promoter activation, illegitimate recombination and overall genomic instability.</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repititive elements are hypomethylated genome wide, leading to aberrant karyotype (deletions, aberrant translocations, insertions etc.) and genomic instability.  </p>
<p>Genome wide hypomethylation of these two regions leads to genomic instability, which causes disease due to the reasons mentioned in the above two paragraphs. Examples  include Immunodeficiency and CranioFacial defects in ICF syndrome in humans (due to mutation of DNMT3B) etc..</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (<strong>*C</strong>) belongs to the class of DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT) inhibitors.</p>
<p>It is a FDA approved, replication dependent DNMT inhibitor used to treat Myelodysplastic syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia(AML).It attaches to the DNA as it is a "nucleoside"(cytidine) analog. Then during replication, when DNMT comes to methylate the residue (Eg:-part of *<strong>C</strong>pG island), it irreversibly binds to the <strong>*C</strong> and cannot get out. Hence DNA becomes globally hypomethylated. It was used earlier in higher (toxic) amounts, but is used today in lower concentrations, leading to decrease of neoplastic cells.</p>
<p>As cancer cells divide more rapidly than normal cells, using the above mechanism, there DNA will be affected more, and hence DNA demethylation will have an anti tumor effect, even maybe for solid tumors and old age patients.</p>
<p>The figures attached is of decitabine (nucleoside analog).<br />References:-<br />Wikipedia (for the figure)<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-5738bb311e58dc8e374f871c/970238/asst-5/970238-52125e2677ddf5.07276771.jpg" alt="" /><br /> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, paternal allele ahs ICR methylated, hence CTCF cannot bind to ICR, and enhancers are free to interact and increase Igf2 expression. H19 transcription remains silent. In cancer cell, the situation remains the same.</p>
<p>In normal cell, maternal allele ahs ICR unmethylated, hence CTCF binds to ICR, and enhancers cannot interact and increase Igf2 expression. H19 transcription is favored and goes from left to right.</p>
<p>In cancer cell, the situation (paternal imprinting) is undone, and the maternal ICR is methylated, hence CTCF cannot bind to ICR, and enhancers are free to interact and increase Igf2 over expression. H19 transcription remains silent and hence H19 is underexpressed. This leads to growth as Igf2 is a growth promoter.</p>
<p>Thus, a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promoter, due to loss of paternal imprinting, leads to a kidney tumor in kids known as Wilm's tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome as epigenetic modifications are mitotically heritable. There is also the possibility of transgenerational epigentic inheritance through the gametes due to incomplete epigenetic reprogramming or messenger molecules.DNA hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor genes, and genome wide hypomethylation may cause genomic/chromatin instability, thus influencing the epigenome.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods in the development of a mammal where altered environmental conditions have an effect on epigenetic control. They are periods of ACTIVE remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>Two major sensitive periods are :-</p>
<ul><li>The period between primordial germ cell development and formation of egg/sperm (gametes)</li>
<li>Pre-implantation and early post implantation period(Early Embryonic Development), from zygote to epiblast.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>It will be an insult to the environment if a drug is taken during sensitive periods, as they are the periods in which ACTIVE remodelling of the epigenome is taking place after erasing nearly all epigenetic marks. Hence, redirecting the epigenome structure using drugs during these periods might cause a faulty epigenomic modification which may lead to diseases like cancer.</p>
