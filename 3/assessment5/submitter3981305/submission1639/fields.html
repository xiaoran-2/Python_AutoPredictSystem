    <h1>Submission 1639 from Anon (session_user_id: 97992a25c1a42c6379549fc76a61f81e76033140)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>The target is the Hypermethylation of CpG islands in cancer cells which possibly caused the silencing of tumour suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Nucleoside analogues irreversibly bind to DNMTs and will be build into the DNA. Those areas are unmethlyted and can’t be methylated again. The gene expression of i.e. a tumour suppressor gene is now activated again. The growth / development is interrupted. This drug needs replicating cells which is usually given in cancer cells.   </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At the paternal chromosome DNA methylation at ICR blocks the binding of CTCF protein.  Without CTCF the promotor region of H19 will be methylated and silenced. Now the enhancers can access Igf2 and activate its transcription.</p>
<p>At the maternal chromosome the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind at that region. This binding isolates Igf2 from the influence of the downstram enhancers. The binding of CTCF to its unmethylated region is called as an insulator effect. The enhancers are unable to activate the Igf2 gene and Igf2 will not be expressed.</p>
<p>With Wilms’ tumour the cells both chromosomes (paternal and maternal) show the methylation at ICR – this means that CTCF won’t bind and the enhancers could reach and Igf2 expression on both chromosomes which lead in an overexpression of Igf2.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Usually CpGs (dinucleotides which could be methylated) in CpG islands are unmethylated and therefore flank active or accessible areas for gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the CpG islands are hypermethylated compared to cells of normal tissue.</p>
<p>Genes in the surrounding areas are silenced which results also in the silencing of tumour suppressor genes).</p>
<p>Usually DNA in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated which cause a more compact chromatin structure and silencing transposon gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated compared to normal tissue. The chromatin is not so densely packed which causes more illegitimate recombination actions (deletions, translocations and insertions) and repetitive elements of transposons and repetitive elements are more transcriptionally active with possibly tumour inducing genes ( genes involved in cell growth etc).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The  sensitive periods are the early development from the fertilized egg to the blastocyte and the germ cell development in the embryo. In this periods the genome will be reprogrammed that the genome will be demethylated for new methylation settings. Any treatment with drugs which cause alteration in methlyation state which will change the expression and silencing of genes. Those changes could cause damage in the child and its offspring.</p></div>
