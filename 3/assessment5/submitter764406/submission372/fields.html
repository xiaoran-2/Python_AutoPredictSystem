    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands are mostly unmethylated, which is important because CpG islands often are located in gene promoter regions. When CPG islands are unmethylated, transcription factors can bind and gene expression can occur. In cancer, there is CPG island hypermethylation. This hypermethylation at CpG islands silences gene expression. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important contributor to cancer because this silencing enables cancer cells to be resistant to apoptosis (cell death that normally would occur with DNA mutations). Normally, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements in DNA are methylated, which is important to maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, there is hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This hypomethylation creates genomic instability. Specifically, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements allows illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats, transposition of repeats, activation of cryptic promoters, and disruption of neighboring genes. These all contribute to the genetic mutations of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, downstream enhancers will bind the Igf2 locus, causing its expression, unless they are blocked by CTCF binding to the imprint control region (ICR) for the H19 gene. Normally, in the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, thus silencing H19. The methylation of the paternal ICR prevents binding of CTCF, allowing the downstream enhancers to access the Igf2 gene, stimulating Igf2 expression. In the maternal allele, however, the ICR is not methylated, which allows CTCF binding and expression of H19; this insulates the Igf2 gene from the downstream enhancers, silencing the Igf2 gene. In Wilm's tumor, the maternal, as well as the paternal, ICR is hypermethylated, so that both alleles express Igf2. Overexpression of Igf2 (a growth factor) drives excessive abnormal growth of immature cells (blast cells) in the kidney, contributing to the nephroblastoma known as Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are normal enzymes that attach methyl groups to DNA at specific locations. Decitablne inhibits DNA methylation by inhibiting the action of DNMTs. The drug can have an anti-tumor effect in tumors that are driven by tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. In these tumors, Decitabine inhibition of DNMTs can inhibit the maintenance of DNA methylation during cell division (by inhibiting DNMT1), thus disrupting the mitotic heritability of tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. In that case, the tumor suppressor genes might resume function and cells with mutated DNA would be more likely to die, suppressing tumor growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment because these epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. Thus, their effects are enduring. In addition, changes in DNA methylation can cause changes in gene expression and alter the balance between genomic integrity and genomic instability. A sensitive period is a time when the environment can have a substantial effect on epigenetic control. Sensitive periods are the times of active remodeling of the genome. For the entire organism, the sensitive periods of development are pre-implantation to early postimplantation development and the period of primordial germ cell development. In addition, individual tissues have specific cell-type sensitive periods during their development. Treating patients with drugs that alter DNA methylation during sensitive periods would be inadvisable because the drugs would interfere with the normal processes of DNA demethylation and resetting of methylation that are supposed to occur during those periods. Clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks during these sensitive periods is necessary for normal development.</p></div>
