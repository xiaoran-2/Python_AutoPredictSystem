    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that affects cell function by altering gene expression and refers to the covalent addition of a methyl group, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), to the 5-carbon of cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide. In cases of cancer,  promoter CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, thus causes the silence of underlying genes, some of which are <span>required for proper cell growth control, and that is a common mechanism in the development of many types of cancer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is to maintain genomic stability. The repeats and the intergenic intervals are tend to be hypomethylated, thus causes the illegitimate recombination between repeats and the activation of repeats and transposition, and even the activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes, all of them are concerned as genomic instability. And the genomic instability is the main cause of many cancers.</span></span></p>
<p>In fact, role of DNA methylation plays in tumorigenesis hav different dependencies. If the tumour is driven by tumour suppressor hypermethylation, then depletion of DNA methylation will suppress tumorigenesis, while the depletion of DNA methylation to a tumour driven by chromosomal instability appears to enhance it.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is indicated for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (</span><span class="caps">MDS</span><span>), being <span>incorporated into </span><span class="caps">DNA</span><span> during replication and </span><span class="caps">RNA</span><span> during transcription,</span><span> thus inhibiting methyltransferase and causing demethylation in that sequence.  There is an enzyme responsible for methylating newly synethesized DNA, the binding of the drug and the enzyme<span> results in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis. <span>Decitabine-induced hypomethylation in cells may restore normal function to genes that are important for the cellular differentiation and proliferation control. And when it comes to the rapidly dividing cells, decitabine will be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine. This results an anti-tumor effect. Additionally, non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to it, so it is safe to normal cells.</span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the imprinted region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and it is methylated on the paternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF bind the imprinted region thereby causes the enhancement acting on H19, resulting in the silence of lgf2. And when the imprinted region is methylated, the enhancement could act on lgf2, thus increasing the expression of lgf2.</p>
<p>In the cases of Wilm's tumour, hypermethylation of ICR causes the methylation on the imprinted region on maternal allele, thus making the CTCF fail to bind the imprinted region and enable the enhancement act on lgf2, which leads to the overexpression of lgf2 in this type of tumours. And lgf2 is growth promoting, associating with the abnormal growth of the tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenetic changes are meiotically and mitotically inheritable, so they will be passed from daughter cells to grandaughter cells during cell division until they are actively erased. That is why altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. There will be a sensitive period during which the environment may easily influence the epigenetic make-up. The period from primordial germ cells to mature eggs and sperms and the period of gametes to epiblast are two sensitive period in development. Both of them are active remodeling of epigenome. During these periods, the epigenetic marks are removed and line down, so the genome will be more sensitive to environmental changes. If patients are treated during this period, some of other changes of epigenome will occur and may cause some unpredictable consequences, for example, congential diseases. Therefore, it is inadvisable to treat patients during these two period.</span></p></div>
