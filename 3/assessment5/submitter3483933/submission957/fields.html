    <div class="field-value"><div> </div>
<p>*DNA methylation is the addition of CH3 (methyl groups) to cytosines that are found in CpG dinucleotides.  The addition of methyl groups is associated with gene silencing when found at promoters, and helps to maintain genetic stability.  In normal cells, the CpG islands are not highly methylated, which allows tumor suppressor genes to be active – keeping cancer at bay.</p>
<p>*CpG islands can become hypermethylated or “more” methylated than in normal cells, which results in silencing of tumor suppressor genes resulting in various types of cancers. </p>
<p>*Normal DNA methylation at CpG islands allows tissues to be normal, and replicate normally.  In situations of disease, the CpG islands typically become hypermethylated, which causes the tissue cells to change from normal to hyperplasia, to neoplasia, to tumor invasive tissue (ie. Cancer or diseased). </p>
<p>*In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated, which silences certain genes found in these regions.</p>
<p>*In cancer cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated or “less” methylated than in normal cells.</p>
<p>*Disruption of DNA methylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements results in instability of the genes found in these regions, often activating them.  Activation of certain genes often has a “domino effect” where the active genes produces too much of its protein, which in can reduce tumor suppressor gene activity allowing for cancer cells to take over.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>
<div>*On the paternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is methylated, and thus has not CTCF binding of the insulator region.  This allows the enhancers to act on Igf2 and Igf2 is expressed by the paternal allele.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>*On the maternal allele, the Imprint Control Region (ICR) is unmethylated, and as a result, the CTCF binds and insulator element.  This causes the enhancers to act on H19, but Igf2 is silenced  (not expressed) by the maternal allele.</p>
<p>*Wilm’s tumour is the result of both the maternal and the paternal alleles being methylated.  Both express Igf2 resulting in a double dose of Igf2, which is a growth promotor.  Wilm’s tumour is a childhood cancer resulting from the overexpression of Igf2 and results in kidney tumours.</p>
<p>*When imprinting is disrupted by methylation, the result can be an either an overexpression of growth promoting genes as seen in Wilm’s tumours, or it can result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes.  Either situation can lead to disease ie. Tumours, cancers, etc.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>*Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>*Decitabine has been used in conjuction with histone-deacetylase inhibitors to treat patients with advanced lung cancer.  The results have so far been positive, showing a significant slowing of growth of the tumours associated with the lung cancers.  These types of tumours are known as “solid” tumours, but it appears that the Decitabine in conjunction with histone-deacetylase inhibitors apparently were able to penetrate into the “solid” tumours themselves.</p>
<p>*It is thought that Decitabine in conjunction with histone-deacetylase inhibitors can enter tumours (specifically “solid” tumours associated with lung cancer) and alter the tumour cells themselves so that the cells are then more susceptible to other treatments such as chemotherapy.  It is also thought that Decitabine in conjunction with histone-deacetylase inhibitors somehow causes epigenetic changes to the tumour cells that are not erased from subsequent generations of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>*DNA methylation, can refer to either the addition or deletion of methyl groups from genes.  Methylation can change gene expression and act like a switch mechanism, either enhancing or silencing certain genes within the genome.  The underlying genome is not changed in its nucleotide sequence.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>*Sensitive periods are important times during the development of an organism or cell, such as the establishment of epigenetic marks that are laid down and removed at very specific times.  If there is a disruption of the normal processes of the cell during these times, the results can be incorrect imprinting or hyper or hypomethylation.</p>
<p>*The sensitive periods of development are the pre-implantation stage and the early post-implantation stage.  During these sensitive periods, the epigenetic controls can be altered due to environmental factors.</p>
<p>*There are drugs that can alter the epigenetic marks of cells being used to treat cancer.  These drugs affect ALL cells in the body and therefore it is important to consider who is getting these drugs and when.  For example, young children still going through development could have improper methylation to developing germ cells which could lead to potentially harmful results.  Thus, it is important to consider the sensitive stages of a patient prior to treatment with epigenetic drugs.</p></div>
