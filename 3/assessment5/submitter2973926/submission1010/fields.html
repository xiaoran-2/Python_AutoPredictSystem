    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are normally not methylated they may undergo methylation in imprintig or inactivations of specific genes specially to maintain the genome stability.</p>
<p>CpG methylation may result in many bad consequences , such as down regulation of tissue specificity. CpG methylation in region upstream to tumor suppressor gene result in down regulation of expression  this gene ,whiche control the cell cycle, apotosis ,and DNA repair machine.</p>
<p>accumulation of dna polymerase mistakes during replication result in defective genes arise and may result in douplications , deletions or even translocations.All thoes may result in genome instability.<br />uncontrole growth of the cell.<br />apoptosis is blocked.so the cell never die. </p>
<p>all of this events above lead to the origination of cancer.<br />there are three regions of cpg islands hypermethylations <br />cpg islands</p>
<p>cpg islands hypermethylator phenotype<br />and cpg shores <br /> cpg hyper methylation takes place stochastically through <br />loss of fedility of dna polymerase and/or  mutations in enzymes <br />Cpg island methylation correlated with many diseases specially in brains , but widely result in cancers.</p>
<p>The DNA hyper methylation cause cancer progressively through many accumulations of layers of mutations. <br />the repetitive elemints usually kept silent  (LINE ,SINE).these methylated elements are interubted  by enzymes  rather erase methyle groups couse of making repites more accessible for transcriptions and other cellular activities .that result in recombinations with other non-homolog chromosome and genomic instability begin to spread.</p>
<p>hypomethilation of repeats originated from mutations in Dnmt 3 and Dnmt 3 B<br />hypomethylation may lead to activations oncogenes.<br /> which ls responsible of the intiation of cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>altaration in dna methylation in ICR regions(hypomethylation or hypermethylation) may result in loss of exprission or promoting of expression of Igf2 growth factors.<br />In the maternal gene the CTCF is binding to un methylated ICR or insulator , this leads to prevent or insulat the effect of enhansers on the maternal igf2 which evventually cause to imprinting it but rather activate H19 gene.</p>
<p>In paternal cluster the ICR or insulator  and the H19 is methylated then th CTCF couldnot bind to  ICR any more this lead to block the effect of insulator and then the enhancers can activate Igf2 .<br />that was about the normal case of the h19 /Igf2 cluster .but in cace of hypermethylation of the maternal ICR and the H19 this cause imprinting also for the maternal gene and Activation of the Igf2 .</p>
<p>If the paternal Igf2 and maternal Igf2 is expressed ,the the cell is subjected to the effect of double dose of the growth factor , and this lead to Wilm's disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine is belong to DNA demethylation drug agents . this drug demethylate methyled genes .and used to treat myelodysplastic syndrom..<br />Combination of deacetylase inhibitor and desitabine ,they can really slow down the growth of the advanced stages of tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation has endurible effects on epigenome because it is heritable process and maintained by enzymes have ability to recognize half methylated strand and methylate the complementary. another mechanisms are The parent of origin specific manner conroled by ICR elemnt.<br />sensitive period is the period in which the epigenetic is reseting for example the demethylation of the whole genome in the sperm after firtelization ,erasure of the whole  epigenetic marks but the ovum under go demethylation depending on cell division when methyltransferase enzyme is excluded ,this period called the early development periods ends after implantation.<br />premordial germ cell period is also sensetive period  where the PGCs are reset their epigenetic marks (methylation state) and staplished these marks in the mid gestation period.<br />Another sesitive periods (adoliscent period ) where the young people is starting formation and maturation of their germ cells .this period is so sensitive because thoes young ppatients under very rapid physiological changes (changes in hormons , transcriptio rate of different genes and even regulation for others ). Dnmt and any other epigenetic treatment or compinations between medicins are not recommended in this period and it may have along lasting harmfull effect inheritable to the next generation (it affect germ cells)</p></div>
