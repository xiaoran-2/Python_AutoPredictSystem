    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are found at promoters and are normally unmethylated in cells, independent of their activity state. However, in cancer this is disrupted and the CpG islands instead tend to be hypermethylated. As they are found at promoters methylation leads to gene silencing. This is because methylated CpGs can be bound by proteins which can have both a DNA binding domain and a transcriptional repression domain as well as being able to recruit other factors to consense the chromatin. Sometimes methylated CpG can prohibit transcription factor binding, also leading to the silencing of the gene. This can lead to silencing of tumour surpressor genes which contributes to tumorigenesis as tumours are able to grow unchecked. The hypermethylation progresses with time, so gradually increases as tumours grow.</p>
<p>Unlike CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitve elements are usually methylated in cells. Methylation maintains geonomic stability in intergenic regions by preventing deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions and also silences reciprocal translocation. Methylation also maintains stability at repetitive elements by silencing repeats to prevent transposition, preventing transcriptional interference with neighbouring genes and preventing illegitimate recombination. However, in cancer these regions are instead hypomethylated and like hypermethylation of CpG islands this progresses with tumorigeneis. This means that as the methylation of CpG islands increases, the methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements decreases. The instability caused by hypomethylation leads to increased tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is methylated at the imprint control region, so the CTCF insulator protein is unable to bind and methylation spreads to the H19 promoter. This means that the ICR and H19 promoter are both methylated and the downstream enhancers are able to access the Igf2 to activate expression. However, the maternal allele is unmethylated at both the ICR and the H19 promoter and so the CTCF insulator protein is able to bind to the ICR. The CTCF protein blocks the downstream enhancers from reaching the Igf2 gene and so it is not expressed and instead act upon the H19 gene.</p>
<p>This is disrupted maternally in Wilm's tumour, as here the maternal allele is hypermethylated at the ICR and also at the H19 promoter, enabling the enhancers to activate the Igf2 gene in the maternal allele as well as the paternal allele. This leads to Igf2 overexpression, which contributes to the growth of Wilm's tumour as Igf2 is growth promoting,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. As DNMTs lay down DNA methylation, Decitabine prevents methylation and so can treat cancer by reducing tumour surpressor gene hypermethylation at the CpG islands, so allows tumour surpressor genes to be activated and work to reduce tumour size. The DNMTi irreversibly binds to DNMTs after they are incorperated into DNA, and so are therefore replication dependent. As cancer cells replicate more often than normal cells, the Decitabine will have a greater effect on cancerous cells, helping even more to reduce hypermethylation of tumour surpressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, any alterations to the marks are also mitotically heritable and so altering DNA methylation would have permanent effects on the epigenome - any increase or decrease in methylation within a cell would we passed onto its daughter cells, so drugs altering the DNA methylation would have effects lasting beyond the period of treatment.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods in epigenetics are when environmental factors can have an effect on epigenetic control. Both pre-implantation and primordial germ cell development are sensitive periods in human development as these are periods when epigenetic marks are laid down. Treating patients during these sensitive periods would be inadvisable because of the long term effects that epigenetic alterations have and the susceptibility of the cells in this sensitive period. Also, in these young stages germ cell development has to be considered as germ cells with incorrect epigenetic marks could lead to diseases and complications in offspring as well as in the patient. </p></div>
