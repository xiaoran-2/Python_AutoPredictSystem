    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>CpG islands are areas enriched with CpGs, and occur often at promoter regions of genes. Methylation of these CpG islands leads to changes in the chromatin structure in that region, and thus, gene silencing. In normal cells, CpG islands tend to be protected from methylation except in cases such as X-inactivation, imprinting, or in the differentiation of some cell types. </span></span></span></p>
<p>In cancer, CpG island hypermethylation is generally observed. Hypermethylation is not uniform across all cancers but rather, varies by type or subtype of cancer, and thus, may be potentially useful for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, and even for therapy. The hypermethylation seems to be observed in cancer at particular CpG islands associated with promoter regions, and can contribute to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Silencing of genes that function to regulate the cell, such as cell cycle checkpoint genes, DNA repair genes, regulators of apoptosis, can lead to cells eventual gaining of the hallmarks of cancer. Indeed, hypermethylation of CpG islands seems to increase as cancer progresses.</p>
<p>Cancer cells also often differ from normal cells in the overall level of methylation. Normal cells have DNA that is highly methylated at intergenic regions and repetitive sequences, such as those associated with transposons and retroviral insertions. On the other hand, in many cancers, genome-wide hypomethylation is observed, and increased hypomethylation is seen as the cancers progress. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive sequences would remove a crucial silencing mark for transposons, and also allow illegitimate recombination between repeats, leading to increased genomic instability. Hypomethylation of originally CpG-poor promoters would also lead to gene activation, and contribute to the development of cancer if those activated genes are oncogenes that impart to the cell properties associated with the hallmarks of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the <em>H19/Igf2</em> cluster, normal imprinting leads to H19 being expressed from the material allele and Igf2 being expressed from the paternal allele. </p>
<p>This selection of gene expression by allele is due to methylation of the imprinting control region between <em>H19</em> and <em>Igf2</em> in the paternal allele, but not in the maternal allele. The net result is in the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the control region all the way to the <em>H19</em> promoter silences expression of <em>H19</em>, but allows enhancers to act on <em>Igf2</em>, leading to its expression. Conversely, the unmethylated ICR in the maternal allele is recognized by the insulator protein CTCF, which blocks enhancer action on <em>Igf2</em> but leaves <em>H19</em> open for expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumor, hypermethylation of the ICR in Wilm's tumor on both alleles leads to the loss of <em>H19</em> expression and the overexpression of <em>Igf2</em> from both paternal and maternal alleles.</p>
<p><span><span><em>Igf2</em></span></span><span><span> overexpression increases proliferation of cells. It is a mitogen (promotes mitosis) for cells in culture, and promotes growth. (</span></span><a href="http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=IGF2&amp;search=Igf2">http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=IGF2&amp;search=Igf2</a> <span><span>). This suggests that aberrant hypermethylation of this ICR may lead to sustained cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent. Chemically it is a nucleoside analog. It looks like a C nucleoside, and inhibits DNA methyltransferase and it is now used for myelodysplastic anemia. By inhibiting DNA methylation, it leads to genome-wide hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Decitabine's metabolites are incorporated into DNA during replication, which means it has some selectivity of action in rapidly dividing cells. These analogs are recognized by DNMT as C, but decitabine forms an irreversible complex with DNMT, leading to inhibition.</p>
<p>For cancers where DNA hypermethylation is important, then the use of DNMT inhibitors may be a good strategy. In particular, when methylation leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes, such as by methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions for such genes as discussed in Question 1, then inhibiting DNMTs could lead to reactivation of expression of those tumor suppressor genes in subsequent cycles of cell division.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically stable because after replication, maintenance DNMT1 “copies” the methylation marks laid on the parent DNA strand onto the daughter strand. If DNA methylation patterns are altered by epigenetic drugs, the resulting new patterns can be maintained in subsequent daughter cells after the original drug is gone.</p>
<p>In cancer, if aberrant DNA methylation that silences tumor suppressor genes is erased, then normal tumor suppressor gene expression is restored. This “reprogramming” from cancer to normal-like epigenetic state can make subsequent chemotherapy more effective.</p>
<p>However, epigenetic reprogramming also normally occurs during early embryonic development and during the development of primordial germ cells into gametes. During this sensitive periods, epigenetic programming must be cleared and reset so that post-fertilization development and differentiation can occur, and later on, so that germ cells/gametes can be reset even as the somatic cells proceed with their developmental program. In addition, imprinted genes have to be cleared and reset during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>This normal development processes could go haywire if patients are treated with epigenetic modifiers, especially non-specific epigenetic modifiers, during sensitive periods such as embryonic development and during periods of germ cell development and maturation.</p></div>
