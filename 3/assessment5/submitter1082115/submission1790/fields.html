    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CpG islands (CGIs) are mostly unmethylated in gene promoters. In cancer cells, CGI methylation increases as diseases progresses. Actually, tumour suppressor hypermethylation occurs more frequently than mutations. Mechanistically, CGI methylation acts by silencing tumour suppressor genes, which induces aberrant cell proliferation. For instance, the <em>MLH1</em> gene promoter is hypermethylated in certain colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>Cancer cells also differ from normal cells with respect to their methylation levels in intergenic regions and repetitive elements; however, in these cases, the DNA is often aberrantly hypomethylated. In normal cells, methylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements silences them. In cancer cells, hypomethylation modifies chromatin structure and makes repeats more susceptible to recombine, favours transposition, or activates cryptic promoters and disrupts adjacent genes. All these processes contribute to genetic instability, which in turn may activate oncogenes or silence tumour suppressor genes and may therefor lead to cancer development. Many human cancers are indeed characterized by aberrant karyotypes, consequences of genetic instability, and by general hypomethylation (except in CGIs) which progresses with the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is a region subject to parental imprinting : on the paternal allele, an imprinting control region (ICR) is methylated, and this methylation spreads to the H19 promoter. This prevents neighbouring enhancers from acting on the H19 gene : they rather activate the expression of the Igf2 gene. On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated and can thus bind to the CTCF insulator element. This prevents the enhancers from activating Igf2 (which is downregulated) and they activate H19 instead (which can further turn Igf2 off).</p>
<p>In Wilm’s kidney tumour, the maternal ICR is methylated similarly to the paternal allele. Maternal H19 is turned off while Igf2 is overexpressed. Overall, this doubles the expression of Igf2 protein. Since Igf2 promotes cell growth, this hypermethylation of the ICR contributes to cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), therefore it hypomethylates DNA. It is a cytidine analogue : once incorporated into the DNA, it irreversibly binds DNMTs. Although its exact mechanisms of action remain unclear, it could act by counteracting hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes and therefore preventing their inhibition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that modify DNA methylation may have long-lasting effects because, by definition, epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, i.e. epigenetic changes are transferred to daughter cells during division. Such heritability does not happen in specific periods when epigenetic marks are reprogrammed: during early embryonic development (before implantation) and when germ cells are formed (mid-gestation). During these sensitive periods, altering the epigenome may have dramatic consequences, either for the developing individual or for its progeny derived from the affected germ cells. For instance, DNA methylation stabilizes random X chromosome inactivation (XCI): treatments which remove DNA methylation may disturb XCI and lead to aberrant gene expression. Another example concerns neurodevelopmental diseases. Studies on monozygotic twins suggest that variations in their DNA methylation could explain differences in psychiatric diseases. These variations may have occurred after embryonic development, for instance during early childhood. Indeed, in rodents, maternal grooming decreases the methylation level at the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in the offspring hippocampus and this in turn affects their response to stress later in life. Overall, though very promising, drugs that alter the epigenome must be carefully monitored to avoid serious side effects, especially on developing embryos and young children.</p></div>
