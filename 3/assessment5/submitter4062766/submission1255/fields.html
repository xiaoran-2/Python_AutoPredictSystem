    <div class="field-value"><p>Vertebrate genomes contains regions with short interspersed DNA sequences that are highly rich in cytosine and guanine mediated by a phosphodiester bond, and therefore referred to as CpG island.  Cpg islands are predominantly nonmethylated, if the gene in question is expressed and most of the CpG islands are the site where transcription is initiated. Methylation at the CpG sites in the promotor of a gene is responsible for gene silencing. But the methylation happens at CpG shores, a short distance from the CpG Island, rather than in the island themselves.</p>
<p>However, in cancer cells methylation happen within the CpG islands themselves, making them hypermethylated. This in turn causes the silencing of the underlying gene. when hypermethylation happens within a promotor of a gene that codes for a tumor suppressor gene, cancer cell growth may ensue due to the silencing of this gene, for example CIMP in  colorectal cancers and gliomas; alternatively, if hypomethylation of an oncogene happens, we can have over-expression of the gene product and cancerous growth resulting.</p>
<p>Most of the genome is made up of intergenic regions and repetitive elements which play an important role in imprinting. In many cancer cells these regions are hypomethylated. It's believed that cancers associated with regions and elements is a result of genomic instability due to hypomethylation. The lack of methylation and chromatinisations leads to reciprocal translocations, deletions and insertions. It is important to note, that when it comes to considering the influence of DNA methylation on the pathogenesis of cancer, context is very important. For instance, in tumor suppressor hypermethylation, depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumorigenesis. Whereas, in chromosomal instability, depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprints are established by two major mechanisms: DNA methylation and histone modification. Imprinting gene expression is done by a cluster of genes known as the ICR. The H19/Igf2 cluster of imprinted-genes enhance-blocking is the mechanism responsible for imprinting. H19 is a long non coding RNA produced at the maternal allele which does not influence imprinting at this cluster, but is a reservoir for microRNA. The unmethylated ICR is bound by a protein called CTCF, an insulator protein. This protein insulated Ig2 from the enhancers down-stream. The enhancers are free to act on H19 on the maternal allele. This is caused by chromatin looping. On the paternal allele ICR is methylated, preventing CTCF from binding and the enhancer downstream are able to activate Igf2. Also DNA methylation spreads and silences H19.</p>
<p>In <span>Beckwith-Weidemann,</span> the H19/Igf2 clusters are disrupted on chromosome 15q15.5 leading to lose of Cdkn1c, a tumor suppressor and upregulation of Igf2, an oncogene. There is an appearance of two paternal-like and lose of the maternal-like allele because of this disruption. With too much Igf2 and no Cdkn1c expression, there is more growth promotion and little to no growth inhibition.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes to the epigenetic machinery occur in a broad spectrum of tumor types. Every class of the epigenetic machinery is mutated in cancer, which leads to downstream consequences in terms of epigenetic mistakes made because of these mutations.</p>
<p>These epigenetic abnormalities (unlike genetic mutations) can be reversed to treat cancer. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) is targeted by decitabine. This drug is approved for use by the FDA in myelodysplastic syndrome progressed to AML. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog that gets incorporated into DNA during replication. When DNMT comes along to bind it to copy the methylation to the daughter strand, that DNMT molecule is bound irreversibly and can no longer be released.  Therefore, the cell has to be replicating for decitabine to function as an inhibitor. Cancer cells dividing rapidly will be affected more than other cell. At low doses decitabine is a potent DNMT inhibitor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Mitotic heritability guarantees that drug-altered DNA methylation is passed onto the daughter cells. These changes are not just passed on to the daughter, but also to the granddaughter cell during mitotic cell division. This may be the reason why changes in DNA methylation last beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p>During genetic reprogramming there are two waves of reprogramming that may occur: the first one happen during germ cell development and the other during early development. These two periods are known as the sensitive periods of genetic reprogramming. During these periods epigenetic reprogramming and genomic imprinting take place.</p>
<p>Very early after fertilization in early development the paternal and maternal nuclei exist as separate pro-nuclei. Within the first six hours of post-fertilization, the paternal genome is rapidly demethylated, whereas the maternal is demethylated more slowly, reaching a global low at the blastocyst stage. This happens because DNMT,the enzyme responsible for methylation, is excluded form the nucleus. After implantation, the epigenetic marks are reestablished. Enzyme inhibitors may, in theory, affect the resetting of epigenetic marks during primordial germ cell development and early development. It would therefore be inadvisable to treat patients during sensitive periods.</p></div>
