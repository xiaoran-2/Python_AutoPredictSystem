    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are regions containing a high density of CpG dinucleotides, ranging from 300-3000bp in length. These islands are biased to promoter regions, occurring in ± 60% of promoters. In healthy cells, promoter CpG islands are usually not methylated, irrespective of their activation status. However, in cancer cells, DNA methylation is often deregulated causing aberrant hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands and consequent gene silencing. CpG island DNA methylation is locus specific and the subset of CpG islands silenced vary between different cancer types. Most notably, epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes occur more frequently than mutations in tumour suppressors and promote tumourigenesis.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions, especially repetitive elements, are normally silenced by methylation so that these areas are condensed as heterochromatin. In contrast, hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements seems to be an early occurance in tumourigenesis. This allows illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation and transposition of repeats and activation of cryptic promoters and consequent disruption of neighbouring genes. These hypomethylation-dependent changes contribute to disease by causing genomic instability, and subsequent cancers, as seen in mice and in humans upon deletion of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, respectively.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the imprinting control region (ICR) blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF and DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter, which leads to silencing of this long non-coding rna (lncRNA). This allows enhancers to access Igf2, most likely through chromatin looping, leading to Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated, allowing CTCF to bind. In this case, the enhancers cannot access the Igf2 promoter and H19 is expressed instead.</p>
<p>In patients with Wilm’s tumour, loss of imprinting of Igf2 occurs due to aberrant methylation and silencing of H19. This leads to overexpression of Igf2, since it is now biallelically expressed. Since Igf2 is a growth factor, its’ overexpression will promote cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analogue which acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that induces non-specific DNA methylation. Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect in tumours where CpG island methylation is a driving force, i.e. in myelodysplastic syndrome, which has progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. The mechanism of action of DNMT inhibitors are still unclear, but since they require mitosis, they seem to preferentially target fast dividing cells such as cancer cells.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable – drugs targeting DNA methylation will therefore have a lasting effect on the daughter cells. A sensitive period may be defined as a period where the organism and/or its progeny is more sensitive to epigenetic reprogramming – these include the pre-implantation period and primordial germ cell development during embryonic development. Further, we know that certain environmental factors present in the early childhood years may have long-term epigenetic consequences – constituting a sensitive period, albeit to a lesser extent than in <em>in utero</em> development. Treating patients during these sensitive periods, i.e. pregnant women or children or perhaps anyone still wanting to have children would be inadvisable due to the possible effects on the subsequent generation, and even the F2 generation, due to the possible effects on primordial germ cell development <em>in utero</em>.</p></div>
