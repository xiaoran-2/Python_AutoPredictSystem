    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Liberation Sans Narrow', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">DNA methylation usually results in silencing of the associated gene.  CpG islands in the genome lack DNA methylation allowing expression of the associated gene.  In cancer, the CpG islands of promoters of tumor suppressing genes become hypermethylated. Consequent silencing of a tumor suppressing gene then leads tumor growth.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Liberation Sans Narrow', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In contrast  intergenic regions and repetitive regions are more heavily methylated, silencing those regions of the genome.  In cancer, these genomic regions become hypomethylated.  Consequent expression of those less methylated regions can result in illegitimate recombination due to misalignment of unmethylated repeats in open chromatin, or in activation of the repeats themselves.  Either case results in genomic instability and increased possibility of cancer due to genetic errors.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer because many imprinted genes have growth related functions.  Either silencing of growth restricting genes or overexpression grow promoting genes can result from disruption of imprinting.  For example, consider the paternally imprinted H19/Igf2 gene with an imprint of DNA methylation on the paternal allele, but not on the maternal allele.  In the paternal allele the downstream enhancers express the Igf2 gene, but in the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the unmethylated imprint control region (ICR) and insulates the Igf2 from being expressed.  Instead, in the maternal allele, the enhancers express the 'next-preferred' gene of H19.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However hypermethylation of the maternal allele prevents binding of CTCF at the ICR, allowing expression of Igf2.  The resulting increased dose of  growth promoting Igf2 – from both alleles leads to Wilm's tumor.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Liberation Sans Narrow', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Decitabine acts as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  DNA incorporates Decitabine upon replication.  The daughter stand then irreversibly binds DNMT1 when the DNMT1 attaches to methylate it, resulting in hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis[1]. Because his process occurs during cell division, the cells that divide more, i.e. cancer cells, more quickly respond to an appropriate dose.</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:'Liberation Sans Narrow', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Because epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, altered DNA methylation endures through DNA replication.  Epigentic marks are reprogrammed twice in the life of an individual: first, when the primodial germ cells of the parent develop: from mid-gestation embryo until adulthood and second in the early development of the individual from after the zygote first forms until implantation. In early development the epigentic marks are removed quickly by active hydroxylation and demethylation of the sperm's paternal genome and more slowly by passive cell division as DNMT1 is excluded from the dividing nucleus of the egg's maternal genome.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:'Liberation Sans Narrow', sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Epigenetic marks have increased vulnerability to environmental influence during these two sensitive periods.  Thus, treating patients during these times could disrupt the resetting of the epigenetic marks of their offspring.</span></span></p></div>
