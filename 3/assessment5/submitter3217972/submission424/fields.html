    <div class="field-value">In normal mammalian cells, methylation at CpG islands occurs predominantly in promoter regions, and acts to suppress expression of the downstream gene sequences.  These marks are mitotically heritable.  In a malignancy, the CpG island methylation increases over time, while global methylation declines (specifically in intergenic regions and repetitive elements).  Most tumors are shown to have hypermethylation at CpG islands.  

CpG island hypermethylation may silence tumor-suppressor genes in many instances of cancer, so that both alleles of this gene are not expressed.  This gives cells a competitive advantage in growth.  Examples of single gene effects of CpG island hypermethylation are the silencing of the RB gene in retinoblastoma, BRCA1 in breast cancer and hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter in colorectal cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands differs among tumor types.  

Cancer cells have less methylation than normal cells in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  This hypomethylation is progressive, begins early in malignancy, and is found in all tumor types.  Hypomethylation in cancer is found predominantly in repeat regions.  This hypomethylation results in genomic instability.  This may be due to the lessening of the condensed chromatin structure associated with methylation.  The more open format allows for illegitimate recombination among repeats and for transposition events. Transposition events may damage a gene that they interrupt, or inactivate a neighboring gene due to cryptic promoters.  In a normal cell these regions are tightly compacted, and are not subject to these events.

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">In imprinted genes of normal cells, the genes of only one of the two parental alleles are expressed.  In cancer cells, the abnormality causes either expression from both alleles, or silencing of both alleles.  

In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, normally the paternal allele is silenced at the ICR and the H19 promoter.  This allows the enhancer genes to interact with the Igf2 gene and allow expression of Igf2.  The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR, allowing binding of the insulator gene, expression of H19, and consequent interaction of the enhancers with H19 rather than Igf2.  Igf2 is then not expressed from this allele.

Different mistakes in the imprinting event lead to different consequences.  In one cancerous state, both alleles of the cluster are methylated at ICR and at H19.  The insulator CTCF cannot bind to the ICR of either allele.  The enhancers of both alleles now interact with Igf2 and so Igf2 is expressed in a double dose.  This is a growth-promoting gene and overexpression results in a cancerous state.  This particular situation results in Wilm's tumor.  The imprinting mistake is an early event, and Wilm's tumor is a childhood kidney tumor.

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">Decitabine is one of a group of drugs that act on enzymes critical to the epigenetic process.  Decitabine is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi).  DNMTs transfer the methylation pattern of a parent cell to the daughter cells during replication, allowing mitotic heritability of these epigenetic marks.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into the DNA during replication.  Subsequently, the methyltransferase binds, albeit irreversibly.  It is then not available to finish the job of transferring the marks to the daughter strand.

Presumably, the cancer cells are replicating at a faster rate than normal cells, and are most disrupted by the action of Decitabine inhibiting the DNMTs.  Thus, at appropriate doses, the cancer cells of a tumor are interrupted, and the normal cells can regain their ground.  The dosage appears to be critical, as high doses are toxic and don't appear to battle the cancer effectively.  Conversely, low doses appear to interrupt the methylation of DNA at an acceptable rate.

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value">DNA methylation patterns in somatic cells are passed to the next generation through mitosis.  Any change to this aspect of the epigenome can, then, be expected to be passed along through multiple cellular divisions.  If a drug, or combination of drugs, can alter the epigenome of a cancerous cell in the correct way, presumably this will be passed to subsequent generations.  If enough cancerous cells can be targeted in an individual, the malignancy can potentially be arrested.  

Because the DNA methylation pattern is altered, probably non-specifically, it would be risky to utilize this kind of drug therapy on a young person with developing germ cells, or a pregnant woman.  The sensitive stages of the epigenetic events during development, the primordial germ cell formation and the pre-implantation period and early development, could be impaired.  The reprogramming of epigenetic marks would be interrupted and the consequences are at present unknown.
