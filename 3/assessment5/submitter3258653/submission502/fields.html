    <div class="field-value"><div>DNA methylation at CpG islands (CGI's) normally serves to suppress gene expression (In most cases. Can result in activation at times).</div>
<div>In cancer DNA methylation is abberated by either hypermethylation at CGI's in the promoter region of tumour suppressor genes or DNA hypomethylation in CpG poor promoters of oncogenes or microRNA's that target tumour supressor genes. This leads to less supression and more activation of the formation, growth and replication of cells, leading to cancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>DNA methylation normally serves as a silencing mechanism at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</div>
<div>In cancer there is hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elecments (as well as introns) genome-wide. This results in activation of these regions and elements that cause unusual transcripts to be transcribed and exert their effects abberantly, genomic instability by unusual chromosomal rearrangements and transpositions to parts of the genome where they can result in abberant gene transcripts.</div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint control regions (ICR's) can lose their imprinting function by either being hyper- or hypo- methylated, and thus losing monoallelic parent of origin expression (silenced or expressed from both parental allelles rather than one). Of particular importance in cancer, loss of expression of growth restricting and over expression of growth promoting genes can occur (possible sign of pre-neoplastic changes).</p>
<p>This is exemplified by the Igf2/H19 cluster, where the ICR is normally methylated on the parternal but not the maternal allele. The insultor CTCF can bind to the unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele resulting in insulation of the Igf2 gene from its enhancers, which instead work on the H19 gene b (associated with growth restriction). In the parternal allele this does not happen and the enhancers work on their more preferable target the Igf2 gene which is associated with growth promotion. In Wilm's tumour there is methylation of the ICR on the maternal allele, resulting in overexpression of Igf2 (from both parental alleles) and therefore too much growth promotion, and no expression of H19 so no growth supression.                              </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a cytidine analogue, DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that is incorporated. Inhibiting DNMT leads to lower methylation levels (hypomethylation) of DNA. </p>
<p>It is thought that in cancer, hypermethlation of tumour supressor genes may be a causative or contributory factor. Thus, hypomethylating these genes may have an anti tumour effect in and of itself, or in conjunction with more traditional cancer treatments. </p>
<p>Decitabine also causes direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells (such as cancer cells) in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have an enduring effect on the epigenome if the methylation patterns are inherited by subsequent daughter cells and even subsequent generations of the oraganism. Alterations to the maintainance DNA methyltransferase(DNMT), DNMT1 and its effect, is one such mechanism which can result in this. Drugs that target DNMT1 may thus lead to inherited, lasting effects.</p>
<p>A sensitive period in epigenetics, is one at which initial epigenetic marks (de novo, laid by DNMT3's for example) are removed or are being laid down and thus any changes during these periods may affect the early development of the organism. These periods include early development and during primordial germ cell development, when DNA methylation patterns are removed and reset to allow gamete formation (in most of the genome).</p>
<p>It would be inadvisable to treat patients during these periods as any changes due to drugs may last if the epigentic marks are entering a reprogrammming stage. On the other hand, drugs can also cause permanent, unwarrented changes to parts of the genome that are not a target.</p>
