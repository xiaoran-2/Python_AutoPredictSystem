    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands (areas in the DNA with a higher concentration of cytosines and glucosynes) are hypomethylated or not methylated. In cancer, however, these areas and also CpG island shores are found hypermethylated, meaning they have a high amont of methylation marks. This hypermethylation of CpG islands (CGIs), that progresses in time, tends to silence tumour suppressor genes andthe  identity of the hypermethylated CGIs varies with tumour type. Hypermethylation of CGIs in one gene or in sets of genes (associated with CGI methylator phenotype - CIMP) may allow diagnosis and prognosis of types of tumour and tumorigenicity.</p>
<p>Unlike, CGIs, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually found methylated in the genome, being found hypomethylated in the case of cancer. These hypomethylation leads to genomic instability enabling illegitimate recombination between repeats, activitation of transposition of these repeats and activation of cryptic promoters with disruption of neighbouring genes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this cluster there is paternal imprinting, so that Igf2 is only expressed from the patternal allele. In the normal situation the CTCF protein binds to the matternal allele (not methylated), blocking access to Igf2 in the maternal allele so that there is only expression from the patternal allele. In cancer (specifically in Wilm's tumour), the methylation in the maternal allele disapeares and there is expression of Idf2 from both alleles. Since Igf2 is growth promoter, its increased expression contributes to the generation of a tumour,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine, which is being used to treat <span>myelodysplastic syndromes, is DNA-demethylating agent that acts by irreversibly binding to DNA methyl tranferases, thus preventing them from methylating DNA. As cancer cells are more actively dividing (higher degree of replication) than normal cells, they have more DNA methyltrasnferases in operation and are thus more afected by this drug. Since haematological diseases, like myelodysplastic syndromes, are usually dependent on tumour suppressor genes hypermethylation, by bind to DNMTs, this drug decreases the degree of methylation the genome suffers, and so the degree os methylation of these tumour suppressor genes.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sensitive periods of development are periods of active replication such as during early embryonic development and during primordial germ cells development, when there is clearing and resetting of DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks. Treating patients during sensitive periods could permanently alter the epigenetic marks on the genome and thus the epigenome of the patient, potencially leading to diseases due to aberrant epigenetic signaling.</p></div>
