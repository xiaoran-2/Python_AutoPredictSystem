    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. mostly, <span>the CpG sites in the CpG islands of promoters are unmethylated if the genes are expressed. <span>Methylation is central to imprinting, along with histone modifications - it controls transcription of genes</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. <span>in cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene.  When this underlying gene is responsible for tumour repression, you can see that cell growth can progress to cancer</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. methylation at the CpG islands suppresses the gene expression by physically constricting the transcriptional proteins from the gene, in addition to causing changes in the </span></span></span>chromatin structure by it's action on histones forming tight inassible chromatin structures</p>
<p>4. Normal function of methylation at intergenic regions is to regulate (restrict or promote) adjacent gene expression.  Methylation of repetitive elements is primarily related to the scaffolding and architecture of the nuclear - genomic stability</p>
<p>5. Hypomethylation of the genome brings about genetic instability </p>
<p>6.  Disruption of methylation at the intergenic regions and repeat elements can cause transcription interferance.  Namely, through the mechanisms of gene deletion, reciprical translation or insertions.  This means gene mutation can occur, the cause of many diseases.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.  Hypermethylation of the paternal H19 genes and ICR means that the enhancers can facilitate the expression of the lgf2 gene</p>
<p>2. Hypomethylation of the maternal ICR with the resultant action of CTCF  silences the expression of the lgf2, with expression of the  H19 gene</p>
<p>3.  In Wilm's, the maternal allele is hypermethylated on both the H19 and ICR, resulting in expression of lgf2</p>
<p>4. Because now both the maternal and paternal alleles are expressing Lgf2 gene, the person has a double does of this gene.  H19 is responsible for restraining cell growth, and lgf2 is responsible for promoting cell growth.  You can see then,with a double dose of lgf2, a person with this genetics will have tumours.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.  <span>DNA-demethylating agents</span></p>
<p>2.  <span> Decitabine hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. </span></p>
<p><span>3.  This drug removes methyl groups, since in cancer there is hypermethylation at the tumour suppressing gene region which means it's silenced.  This drug allows the tumour suppressing gene to regain it's capacity to express</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.  Changes in DNA methylation can be passed through to daughter cells at the germline phase As they are mitotically heritable.</p>
<p>2.  A sensitive period is when the epigenome can be influenced by environmental factors during a clearing or resetting of the epigenic marks on the genome.  For example, in IVF there are two sensitive periods; when the oocytes are harvested (epigenic resetting is occurring then) and when the embryos are cultured invitro at a time when epigenic reprogramming is occurring.</p>
<p>3. At fertilised egg period to the blastocyst time, and then again primodial germ cell development Where epigenic reprogramming is occurring.</p>
<p>4.  If patients are treated in sensitive periods, the epigenic alterations are mitotically heritable, and will be transferred to the gametes.  Because the methylation changes that these drugs induce are not necessarily specific to certain genomes or parts of genomes, it may well have unknown and risky heritable implications.  Tat is why these newer drugs are used on older patients.</p></div>
