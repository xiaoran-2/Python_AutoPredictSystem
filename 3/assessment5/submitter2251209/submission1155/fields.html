<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">CpG islands are clusters of CpGs that function as gene promoters when they are unmethylated and gene silencers when they are methylated. Both circumstances play a role in cancer: hypermethylation silences tumor-suppressor genes and hypomethylation promotes oncogenes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">In general, methylation tends to increase with time, both in normal aging and abnormal tumor growth, making it a more likely contributor to cancer than genetic mutations, especially since it is mitotically heritable. But these methylations are specific and vary with tumor types, which makes it easier to distinguish normal cells from cancerous, to distinguish tumor types and sub-types, to identify the primary tumor when it is unknown, and to provide an avenue of treatment more accessible than dealing with genetic mutations as these epimutations are reversible. They can inform the prognosis -- hypermethylation is associated with metastasis -- and lead to more specific and effective treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">The intergenic region occurs between a gene and a repetitive element. Repeats make up two-thirds of the genome and generally do not code for protein or RNA. Their function is unclear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Normally this intergenic region is methylated and the repetitive element is silenced. In cancers, this region becomes hypomethylated, allowing the genes in the repetitive element to express themselves. This is associated with a genome-wide hypomethylation of the DNA. It occurs to some degree in all tumor types and progresses with time, creating genomic instability. Repeats that are activated by a loss of methylation can then copy themselves and jump around the genome, activating neighboring genes or promoters and causing abnormal karyotypes, such as deletions in chromosome copying, insertions of duplicate chromosomes, and reciprocal translocations which alter the normal linking of genes on the same chromosome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">This pattern occurs in many human cancers and has been studied in mice.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Some genes are imprinted, that is, they are epigenetically marked as to which parent they came from, so that only one allele will be expressed. This is established in the germline and is mitotically stable. Many genes that are imprinted are involved in growth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the H19 gene is an Imprint Control Region. This allele of the maternal parent is unmethylated, which makes the CTCF protein bind to an insulator element, causing the enhancers to act on H19 and express it. The enhancers do not act on the mother's Igf2 and it remains unexpressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">The paternal allele has its H19 gene methylated, silencing it, so that the enhancers promote Igf2 since CTCF is not binding to the insulator. The father's Igf2 allele is expressed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">In summation, the normal situation is that the mother expresses H19, while the father expresses the Igf2 contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">When the mother's H19 gene is methylated, the maternal allele expresses in the same way as the father's, so that both alleles express Igf2 and neither express H19. Igf2 is growth-promoting and the result is Wilm's tumor in the offspring, a childhood kidney tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Decitabine is described as a DNA-demethylating agent. DNA methylation is a factor in aging and in many types of cancers. Methylation suppresses gene function, of which one important type is tumor-suppressor genes. Decitabine is apparently effective against a specified cancer and this makes sense since these methylations tend to be locus-specific. The epimutations caused by this kind of methylation can be reversed, and the effectiveness of this drug indicates that this hypermethylation is in fact a primary factor in myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;"> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;">Decitabine may effect CpG island methylation, which would restore function to these promoters of tumor-suppressors. It may also work to remove a hypermethylation of an imprinted gene as in the Igf2/H19 example, though this is more often associated with genes affecting growth. Acute myelogenous leukaemia affects adults and becomes more common with age, so this is less likely.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.2in;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">DNA methylation suppresses gene function, a factor in many cancers when tumor-suppressor genes are inactivated. Demethylating these genes or their promoters can restore some normal function to the gene, slow or stop the growth of the tumor, and allow other medications to work. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.2in;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Some methylations and demethylations, however, are necessary to normal growth and function. Epigenetic marks need to be cleared between generations to restore totipotency. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.2in;"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">There are two waves of reprogramming. Between fertilization and the blastocyst stage, the paternal and maternal genomes are demethylated, then during germ cell development, DNA methylation is reset. These are the sensitive periods and it would do harm to interfere with this process by administering drugs that affect methylation.</span></span></p>
