    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally CpG islands in the DNA are unmethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer, the CpG islands become hypermethylated. Also, the normally methylated regions, which are in intergenic islands, intronic regions, repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Methylation of the islands could change the transcription levels for some genes. Specially these could silence tumor suppressor genes, leading to hyperplasia, neoplasia, finally leading to full-blown cancer.</p>
<p>The intergenic regions are normally methylated in the DNA. </p>
<p>In cancer, these islands become unmethylated. </p>
<p>Demethylation of the islands could lead to genetic instability, the activation of cryptic promoters which would lead to excessive gene expression of genes involved in tumorogenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal allele of Igf2 is non-methylated and active.</p>
<p>Maternal allele of Igf2 is methylated and inactive.</p>
<p>H19 ncRNA suppresses Igf2 expression. H19 is active in maternal but not in maternal allele. H19 possibly suppresses the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>If H19 locus is methylated, H19 is no longer transcribed, leading to over expression of Igf2 and hence cancer. Or, if the Igf2 methylation of maternal allele is lost, then there is also overexpression of Igf2, leading to cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a Histone methylation inhibitor and thus changes chromatin remodeling.</p>
<p>It reduces methylation.</p>
<p>In cancer there is usually hypermethylation of CpG islands, which can be reduced with Decitabine.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be mitotically and meiotically inherited.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the period in which epigenetic programming is occuring and when paternal and / or maternal epigenetic marks are removed and new ones added.</p>
<p>The sensitive periods in development relate to the time of hte formation of the embryo, and during primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during this time could potentially affect methylation patterns, which could have life long effects on the fetus and possibly the child of the fetus.</p></div>
