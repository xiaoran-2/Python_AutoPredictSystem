    <div class="field-value"><p>The “mean” normal function of DNA methylation is the activation or the silencing of gens, this regulation of the genome expression is a the key feature of the expressed phenotype of the cell.</p>
<p>in normal tissue, a cell which have been altered by mutagene “like UV, heavy metal, Bisphenol…etc”  need to pass by a successful DNA reparation to stay alive, if not the cell will engage in apoptosis pathway..  </p>
<p>It has be establish that in cancer disease, there is abnormality in CpGislands methylation, this lead to anormal pattern of genome expression,  whit  some time an over expression of anti-apoptosis factor like bcl-2, or over expression of metastatic factor..etc.</p>
<p>There is also abnormality in histone methylation which lead to chromatin instability, whit accumulation of DNA mutation that can’t been repaired and in the same time don’t induce apoptosis  cause of leak of epigenetic  integrity due to  intergenic regions silencing, which are a key of this regulation.</p>

<p>methylation in K9 and K27 and CpG methylation lead to silencing the gene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal humain been, there is only one of the allelic imprinted  gene which are active in the adulte, this regulation  allow sexual phenotype difference between male and female,  one of this imprinted gene are illustrate  here:</p>
<p><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7492bca933cd1b079958fd57/970238/asst-5/970238-520a83af93c414.53985414.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>It’s the H19/Igf2 switch allele, which normally lead to the expression of only one of the tow gene in amle/ female benn, but in cancer there is a Hypermethylation of ICRs -  whit loss of normal imprinting; the best example is the Wilm’s tumour. Where the hypermethylation induce over expression of IgF2 whit abnormal czll growth ;</p>

<p>Wilms' tumor or nephroblastoma is cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>Decitanbit is the only HMA FDA-approved, his action is  based on the  Nuceloside analogies ,it bind  irreversibly the  DNMT. By this it has been classified as an anti-metabolic drug, but it could also said that it’s the first epigenetic modulator drug.</p>
<p>When administered, decitabin are included in DNA through mitosis, when DNMT come over decitabin nucleotide it bind it which bloc the methylation. This will stop DNA transcription and cell proliferation. This will lead to a global DNA hypomethilation.<br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7492bca933cd1b079958fd57/970238/asst-5/970238-520a8f68953782.87565322.jpg" alt="" /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The fact that epigenetic  cell program are normally made to stay unchanged in adult mammalian, explain why any change induced by disease or toxin or drug could have an enduring effect on epigenome.  That one reason way its unlikely to see an cencer cell, which also have genome methylation disorder, turn back to normal cell.</p>
<p>Any way there is two major period in mammalian development which can be describe as a sensitive period of epigenetic  program, the first on are post egg fertilization, and the second one are on primordial germ cells  apparition, any perturbation of the epigenetic program implantation on this period can lead to cell development disorder.</p>
<p><br /><img src="https://coursera-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/user-7492bca933cd1b079958fd57/970238/asst-5/970238-520aafc45dfc03.10548158.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This mean that if a pregnant patient is treated by a drug that disturb epigenetic regulation in the first week of fertilization , it can lead to disease or death of  embryos; and if she is treated after this periode it can lead to disorder in germinal cell development,  whit risk on F2 offspring development. </p></div>
