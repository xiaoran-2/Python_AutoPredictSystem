    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, generally found at promoters of genes, tend to be protected from methylation. DNA methylation in these regions mostly indicates silencing of gene expression. Methylated CpG may be associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure or it may also prohibit transcription factor binding thus altering gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, DNA hypermethylation is seen to occur at specific loci like the CpG islands and ICRs (loss of imprinting).The hypermethylated CGIs vary by tumour type and shows progression with time. It results in silencing of tumour suppressor gene and often seen in tumours as the DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and the epimutations are rapidly selected.</p>
<p>Various diseases occur due to hypermethylation in single genes like that of RB gene in retinoblastoma, MLH1 in colorectal cancer,etc.</p>
<p>CIMPs are seen to be associated with certain tumours like colorectal cancer and can be used in panels of biomarkers assisting in diagnosis or prognosis or in monitoring tumour decline or recurrence.<br /><br />DNA methylation at intergenic regions maintain genomic stability by silencing cryptic promoters or  cryptic splice sites. DNA methylation at repetitive elements do so by silencing the repeats or mutating them to prevent transposition, prevents illegitimate recombination and prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters.<br /><br />In cancer, genome-wide hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic intervals causes genomic instability (activation of cryptic promoters, illegitimate recombination leading to abnormal karyotype). <br />Mutation in DNMT3B causes ICF syndrome in humans.<br />Depletion of DNA methylation may suppress or enhance tumourigenesis depending on tumour type and the effect may be stage specific. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CTFC is an insulator protein.</p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster, in the paternal allele, methylation at ICR blocks CTCF binding.Methylation spreads to H19 to silence it.Thus the encancers access Igf2 to activate it.<br />In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated so that H19 is unmethylated and hence expressed.CTCF binding to ICR insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and Igf2 is not epressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, maternal allele shows loss of imprinting and switches to paternal pattern of methylation. As a result, H19 shows decreased expression and there is overexpression of Igf2 leading to uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>Abnormalities in linked Kcnq1 and H19/Igf2 cluster may produce Beckwith- Wiedemann Syndrome. There may b fetal and post natal growth, Macroglossia, etc. since Igf2 is a growth promoter.<br /><br />  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a compound that acts as a Dnmt inhibitor.</p>
<p>It is a nucleoside analogue and thus gets incorporated in the DNA. During replication when Dnmt acts to set down the methylation marks, Decitabine binds irreversibly to it and inhibits Dnmt action. Thus it is replication dependent shows most effect in proliferating cancer cells.</p>
<p><span>It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. It has anti-neoplastic effect in smaller doses where it promotes DNA demethylation. Since many tumours arise due to hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes, Decitabine may prevent such  hypermethylation.</span><br /> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable until it is actively erased. Once erased, the demethylation will be maintained in the subsequent daughter cells. Thus if the drug alters the methylation in the existing cells, the daughter cells will inherit those altered patterns even after treatment has stopped. As a result, the drug may have a lasting effect.<br /><br />During the development of an individual there are periods when the epigenetic marks are removed and then laid down again, known as the sensitive periods.</p>
<p>There are mainly two such periods during development :</p>
<ul><li>Early embryonic development </li>
<li>During Primordial Germ Cell development and gamete formation</li>
</ul><p>Treating patients with drugs that alter epigenetic marks such as methylation, during sensitive periods poses a risk that the drugs would adversly affect the PGC as well. This might lead to defective development of the gametes.</p></div>
