    <div class="field-value"><p>There are two types of DNA methylation,hypermethylation and hypomrthylation.Hypermethylation is an increase in methylation and hypomethyation is a decrease in methylation  CpG (cytosine phosphate guanine) islands are clusters.of dinucleotides which are promotersof genes, Methylation at the CpG islands silence gene expression,the more CpG methylation the less transcription, In normal cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated and the intergenic region has normal methylation.In the intergenic either or both hypomethylation or hypermethylation can result in loss of  expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes. DNA methylation enables a single normal cell to grow into multiple  organs.Silencing of tumor suppressor genes leads to different types of cancer such as eye, colon, breast, and prostrate cancer Both hypomethylation and hypermethylation appear in most types of cancer depending on the type or CpG island location or in the case of hypomethylation the repeat region. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region causes gene  inacttivation which results in cancer.  Certain genes are selected over others for epigenetic silencing these suppressor genes cause cancer. DNA methylation leads to changes in biomarkers which can lead to a wide variety of diseases. Diseases result from silencing associated with aberrant methylation of promoter regions of CpG islands.  .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is an epigenetic process of gene regulation that involves DNA methylation. It results in a differential somatic expression of two parental alleles in a gene pair. The allele derived from one parent is silenced. An epigenetic modification or imprint causes differential transcription.The imprinted gene Lgf2 is from the paternally derived allele the H19 is maternal. Imprinting is associated with extensive hypomethylation of the Lgf2 allele and extensive hypermethylation of the H19 gene. Imprinted genes can be sensitive to the environment because imprinted genes have only a single active copy.The CTCF gene is a transcription repressor envolved in transcription regulation it influences the expression of genes and blocks the interaction between promoters and enhancers.CTCF binds unmethylated maternal gene blocking transcription to the enhancer and no stimulation of Lgf2 but stimulating transcription from H19. The paternal ICR (Imprinted Center Region) does not allow CTCF to bind to it and prevents transcription from acting on H19. The ICR is methylated in the parernal cluster and unmethylatedin the maternal cluster. Wilms is a childhood kidney cancer caused by an error in early embyronic genes.These genes remain in an early form that cannot be turned off by tumor suppressor genes,.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a deoxycytide epigenetic drug that is used to  treat myetodyspatic syndome (MDS) which is a cancer of the blood cells,a form of leukemia. As a hypomethylating agent it hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methytransferse .A hypomethylating agent is a drug that inhibits DNA methylation and is used to treat cancer tumors. Methylation regulates gene expression in cells. An increase in DNA methylation can cause blockage of the suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked the cell division becomes unregulated which can promote or allow cancer. Reverse methylation or demethylation leads to silencing of tumor suppressor genes then tumor suppressor genes are restored controlling normal cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr.Boylin has demonstrated that a combination of a histone deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slows the growth of tumors in lung cancer patients. These drugs appear to be effective when used in conjunction with chemothearpy .However,these epigenetic drugs appear to alter cells for a long lasting period of time. These drug may be problematic in that their use during periods of early developmwnt may have a lasting effect on various human organs and their function. The use of these drugs could result in hypomethylation or hypermethylation from environmental factors or the use of some drugs in later life. The sensitive period is during pregnancy when these drug should not be used.The sensitive period will vary in accordance with the organ under development. During the sensitive period methylation could effect the genes turning the genes on or off. The use of cell altering drugs can have long lasting effects on normal cell developement and division. Chemotherapy uses chemicals similiar to those found in nornal cells.These chemicals react with tumor cells to cause the death of the rapidly dividing cancer cells.   </p></div>
