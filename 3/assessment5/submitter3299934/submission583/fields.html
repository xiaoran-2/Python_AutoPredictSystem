    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used for treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes as well as acute myeloid leukemia. Decitabine, a nucleoside analog, belongs to a class of drugs that block the enzyme DNA methyltransferase – an enzyme that catalyzes the DNA methylation. Inhibiting this enzyme has a hypomethylating effect on the epigenetic state.</p>
<p>Decitabine is incorporated in the daughter DNA strand by cell division. There, the drug molecule irreversibly binds the DNA methyltransferase molecule by counteraction, thus lowering the availability of the enzyme in the cell and lowering the general level of methylation.</p>
<p>The epigenetic “cancer-causing mutations”, unlike the genetic ones, are reversible and treatable with drugs. Due to the specificities of the Decitabine action, its role in cancer treatment is mainly important in rapidly dividing tumor cells, where the effects of its action can be inherited in the daughter cells and exert positive effects for further treatment with standard chemotherapy for example.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At DNA gene promoters, 5mC methylation is present in about 70 – 80% of the CpG base pairs and is inversely correlated with the gene expression. The opposite is observed for CpG islands in these gene promoters – the CpG islands are usually unmethylated and this is what ensures a normal level of gene expression.</p>
<p>In cancer, in contrast to the overall DNA hypomethylation observed, the CpG islands are demonstrated to be abnormally hypermethylated. This leads to the silencing of the underlying gene, the consequences of which might include genome destabilization, mistakes in the regulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes, or silencing of tumor suppressor genes (the latter essential in the cell cycle and abnormal growth control).</p>
<p>Unlike the CpG islands, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions of DNA are usually methylated in the normal cells. This is because DNA methylation might be mutagenic due to the conversion of cytosine through 5m cytosine to thymine. At intergenic regions, DNA methylation is believed to maintain genomic stability or transcriptional interference by silencing some of the promoters in DNA and thus stopping gene expression (instability is observed if the methylation maintenance enzyme – DNMT1 - is removed). At repetitive elements the DNA metylation also maintains genomic stability and integrity. Repetitive elements, using a specific “copy – paste mechanism” throughout the DNA molecule, could, without the proper epigenetic control, cause a great genomic instability. If they are about to be copied at the inappropriate place, a wrong gene might be expressed.</p>
<p>In basically every cancer that has been studied, there is a level of hypomethylation observed throughout the DNA, and the intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be unmethylated This causes a severe genomic instability and events like deletions, insertions, and other genetic processes that are not supposed to happen at this time might occur.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Due to its mechanism of working, DNA methylation is a mitoticaly heritable – there are some markers proposed, which indicate the methylated cytosine on the mother DNA strand, so that the daughter strand will also become methylated there. Therefore, the DNA methylation and its alterations will be inherited in the daughter cells and will have enduring effect on the cell population that is about to be formed.</p>
<p>There are certain periods when epigenetic clearance and reprogramming occur in the cell. These are called sensitive periods and are found to be the premodial germ cells development, the period of production of mature gametes, and the pre- and early post implantation periods. At these points of development active remodeling of the genome and epigenome takes place. These periods are most sensitive and susceptible to changes in the environment and can have a life-long effect due to the mitotic inheritance of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>Treating patients with epigenome-targeting drugs during e.g. pregnancy might have some long lasting abnormal transgenerational effect and impact the future several generations. Therefore an epigenomic treatment therapy is not advisable in periods when it might affect the embryo at the sensitive periods.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting is the inheritance of a parent-of-origin – maternal or paternal - allele of a certain gene. The gene imprinting depends strongly on the so called Imprint Control Regions (ICRs). One cluster of imprinted genes is the H19/Jgf2 cluster, located at chromosome 11 in humans. The imprinted control region of this cluster is methylated on the paternal allele only, so the gene is paternally imprinted. The methylated ICR here allows for binding of the Igf2 enhancers to Igf2 and its expression. The ICR methylation here also spreads to the H19 region, thus silencing it.</p>
<p>The unmethylated ICR on the maternal allele is bound by the CTCF protein, which does not allow for Jgf2-enhancer binding and further leads to silencing of Jgf2. What follows is binding and activation of the promoter H19, as the latter is the second choice of these enhancers.</p>
<p>Disruptions of Igf2 regulation – loss of imprinting, epigenetic disfunction, <em>etc.</em> – might lead to upregulation of this gene. This strongly contributes to excessive growth and tumor genesis because Igf2 is a growth promoting, oncogene. H19/Igf2 cluster misregulation is seen in the maternaly transmitted Wilm’s kidney tumor in children.</p></div>
