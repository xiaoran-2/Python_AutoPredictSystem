    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is rare. However, when there is methylation at a CpG island, it is associated with gene silencing. DNA methylation at CpG islands is noted in the inactive X chromosome in females, where the methylation aids in silencing the chromosome.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, it has been noted that CpG islands – generally found at the promoters of tumour suppressor genes – tend to be more methylated, or hypermethylated, than is generally seen in healthy cells.</p>
<p>Since in cancer cells CpG islands are generally methylated and CpG islands are commonly found at tumour suppressor genes’ promoters, this would mean that the tumour suppressor function of the cell would be silenced. However, this alone would probably not result in the formation of a cancer and you would need another “hit” to trigger a tumour. Nevertheless, this does have implications, as methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark and rapidly gets preferred. Thus when a cancer does develop, this methylation is swiftly spread.</p>
<p>DNA methylation at intergenic regions plays a role in genomic stability without silencing normal genes. At intergenic regions, DNA methylation will silence cryptic promoters acting in the opposite direction to the traditional promoter so that transcriptional interference will not occur.</p>
<p>In repetitive elements, DNA methylation silences the repeats to inhibit transposition, transcriptional interference that may occur because of the strong promoters and illegitimate recombination. DNA methylation of CpGs may also result in the mutation of meC to T, which over time may be useful in the evolution of the organism.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, the repetitive elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated, which results in genomic instability.</p>
<p>This hypomethylation will result in chromosomes recombining when they are not supposed to. Also, hypomethylation may result in the repeats transposing, thus causing the disruption of gene transcription and the activation of others.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, the ICR is methylated. This prevents the binding of CTCF to the ICR, which results in methylation spreading to the H19 promoter and, consequently, the enhancers can access Igf2, resulting in the expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated. This allows CTCT to bind to the ICR, which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers and, consequently, the enhancers cannot access Igf2, resulting in the non-expression of Igf2.</p>
<p>It seems like the preferred loop is for the enhancers to act on Igf2, but where the ICR is unmethylated, the enhancers are forced to act on the H19 promoter.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, there is a loss of imprinting and both the paternal and the maternal alleles are methylated (hypermethylation). CTCF binding is inhibited, H19 silenced on both alleles and Igf2 active on both alleles resulting in double the amount of Igf2.</p>
<p>Igf2 is an oncogene. So, where there is a double dose of Igf2, this could result in the abnormal growth of the cells, causing a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine falls under the DNMT inhibitor class. Decitabine is merged into the DNA. Therefore, when the cell has replicated and DNMT binds to copy the methylation, it is bound irreversibly, and cannot be released, thus preventing hypermethylation.</p>
<p>This means that DNMT inhibitor drugs will affect cancer cells, which divide rapidly, more than normal cells, which divide slowly, as this class depends on mitosis to act on DNMT. So, at low doses – far lower than they were used at the beginning, which just resulted in subjecting the patients to terrible side effects  – the DNMTi, and particularly Decitabine, have an anti-neoplastic effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, by means of the workings of DNMT1, which has an inclination towards hemi-methylated DNA. Thus, DNA methylation can be classified as a stable epigenetic mark. Because of this, if the DNA methylation is altered – thereby possibly silencing an active gene or vice versa – this mark will last throughout the generations of that cell and its “descendants”.</p>
<p>A sensitive period occurs when epigenetic marks are being cleared or laid down. These sensitive periods include early development, primordial germ cell development and slow growth periods (9-12yrs for males and 8-10yrs for females) with an additional period for females in the foetal/infant period.</p>
<p>In these periods, methylation, or demethylation, of the genome is undergoing change and is instable. Thus, to bring in drugs that will alter methylation in cells would be dangerous as this would most result in the disruption of the epigenetic reprogramming and consequently a host of abnormalities, death of the foetus or drastic problems with the gametes (imprinting disorders, early embryonic lethality, placental insufficiency, germ cell tumours, tumorigenesis, blocks in differentiation and infertility).</p>
<p>What would make abnormalities even worse, is the mitotic heritability of these epi-mutations, thus permeating the abnormalities.</p></div>
