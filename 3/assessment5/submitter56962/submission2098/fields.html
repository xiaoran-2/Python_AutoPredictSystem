    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation is altered in cancer at three regions CpG Islands, Intergenic  , and repetitive elements regions . CpG Islands are usually unmethylated. CpG’s are clustered into CpG islands often at promoters of genes.  Typically DNA methylation of promoter increases gene expression, but CpG’s are exception. Here the DNA methylation acts as silencer of Genes.  Small subset of CpG Islands are dynamically  methylated in different cell types to suppress genes  not needed for a particular cell type.  In Cancer CPG’s become hypermethylated  which causes the silencing of the associated genes.  This causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes that control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair.  Cpg Island shores  ( approx. 2kb region encasing CpG Island) are another target of hyper DNA methylation in cancer. These were detected in colorectal cancer and represent tissue specific methylation regions.  Intergenic regions are normally methylated, they act to suppress  cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites. These sites are found at repetitive sequences such are remnants  of retrovirus insertions in the Human DNA.  DNA methylation at repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity silencing mutant repeats (meC to T)  to prevent  transposition, Also the methylation here acts to silence the repeats in order to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Hypo-methylation of these sites is evident in some cancers. For instance Overexpression of satellite repeats was identified in Pancreatic and other epithelial cancers. The family of TET protiens that are associated with demethylation in ES cells are also implicated in hypomethylation of intergenic and repetitive elements regions,</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, thus it acts to demethylitate.</span><span> It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase (DNTMi). It's mechanism of action is not completly clear, but it's effective in Mylodysplastic syndrome that progresses to AML (leukumia). It's likely that it reverses  hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene, hence helps in haematological malignancies. It acts in chromatin region of the gene. It's action is not specific to cancer type cells, and thus must given carefully, should be avoided in the sensitive preriods of development. It would be inadvisable to give this drug to young patients who are in the period of germ cell development.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation mechanism in epigenetics is a dynamic process. It acts as a turn on/off switch for genes and plays a critical role in entire lifcycle of development. The different tissue cells have identical genes but will have different DNA methylation marks acting as either promoters\suppressors that will differentiate one celly type from another, for instance a neuron from a skin cell. During the pre implementaion period  of oocyte to early development until the epiblast is created and the period of primordal germ cell creation are sensetive periods. These are the stages when DNA methylation is cleared and reestablished correctly.  DNA methylation altering drugs can change the DNA methylation marks permanatly, in the sense the alterations are mitotically inherited. Since the drugs are not very specific, in the sense that they don't only alter cancer cells but can effect all other cells, during the sensitive periods of development they can alter methylation of Germ cells or the embroyonic cells in a non desirable way. This could have very bad consequences, and would inadvisable.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Hypermethylation of imprint control region (ICR) can contribute to cancer as lots of genes that are involved in imprintig are involved in growth they are either promoters or suppressors of growth.  Any disruption to these can result in cancer, this can happen either with hypermethylation or with hypomethylation. In the case of H19/lgf2 cluster, <span style="font-size:14px;">CTCF is an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream </span><span style="font-size:14px;">enhancers. DNA methylation at ICR blocks binding of CTCF binding, absent</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to H19 promoter thus it's </span><span style="font-size:14px;">silenced and enhancers can access Igf2  which is activated.  On the maternal  gene the ICR is unmethylated while on the paternal gene it's. so in Maternal gene CTCF does not bind and  lgf2 is suppressed while on the paternal gene it's enhanced and thus expressed. If there is Hypermethylation of maternal ICR as well then now maternal lgf2 will be expressed as well. In this cell you will have twice the normal expression of lgf2 . Lgf2 is growht promoting and this is what is observed in Wilm's tumour.</span></p>
