    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of drugs known as DNA demethylating agents, more specifically DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Decitabine acts as a nucleoside (cytidine) analogue and is incorporated into DNA strands during DNA replication. It inhibits DNA methyltransferase (the enzyme responsible for methylating newly synthesised DNA) by irreversibly binding DNMT1 resulting in DNMT1 depletion and hypomethylation of the daughter strands. This is useful in the treatment of cancer cells as cancer cells are dividing more rapidly than other cells in the body and can thus be accurately targeted by this drug which is division dependent. The anti-tumour effect of Decitabine is by reactivation of epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor and other cancer-related genes by means of demethylation. Decitabine restores normal function to genes critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation and apoptosis sensitivity. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, the precursor of acute myelogenous leukaemia. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells CpG islands are hypomethylated and generally you don’t see methylation at CpG islands. Exceptions are seen on inactivated X chromosomes and at imprinted genes (Genomic imprinting is the expression of one of two alleles of a gene according to the allele’s parental origin). A few small subsets of dynamically methylated CpG islands can be found associated with silencing of gene expression between different cell types.  </p>
<p>In cancer cells CpG islands are more likely to be methylated, even hypermethylated, and as the cancer progress the degree of methylation increases.</p>
<p>Hypermethylation of CpG islands in promoter regions can cause associated gene silencing thereby inactivating tumour suppressor genes and resulting in deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes controlling the cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation (tumour formation).</p>
<p>In contrast to CpG islands, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. Methylation of intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity and silences cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites thereby preventing transcriptional interference. Methylation of repetitive elements maintains genomic integrity by preventing transposition (which can be mutagenic) of these elements. The results of methylation of the repetitive elements are the silencing of repeats and the causation of mutation of the repeats (meC to T) to prevent transposition. Other reasons for silencing the repeats are to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and to prevent illegitimate recombination between similar repeats.</p>
<p>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated.</p>
<p>When the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are unmethylated you see genomic instability resulting in deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplications and/or loss of chromosomes resulting in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated, i.e. paternally imprinted. The insulator protein CTCF cannot bind to the methylated imprint control region, there is no insulator action from downstream enhancers leaving them free to act on Igf2. Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>The maternal allele is unmethylated. The insulator protein CTCF is able to bind to the unmethylated imprint control region thereby insulating Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. The maternal Igf2 allele is silenced and the enhancers act on H19 and enhance H19 expression. The result is that Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele and not the maternal allele.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour there is hypermethylation of the imprint control region of the maternal allele (in addition to the normal methylation of the imprint control region of the paternal allele).</p>
<p>Therefore CTCF cannot bind to the methylated maternal imprint control region and there is no insulation of Igf2; Igf2 is now expressed from the maternal allele in addition to the expression from the paternal allele. The cell now has a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoter, causing the development of tumours due to overgrowth, e.g. Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation in a cell causes an epigenetic change and epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable. Altering DNA methylation has the potential to affect most cells as most cells will divide at some point.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are those periods when active reprogramming and remodeling of the genome is taking place. During these periods changes to the environment can influence the epigenetic makeup.</p>
<p>There are two sensitive periods for epigenetic reprogramming. The first is during pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and the second is during primordial germ cell development which starts in the mid-gestation embryo all the way through to the production of mature gametes.   </p>
<p>During sensitive periods epigenetic reprogramming are taking place and the results of this will be passed on to all somatic cells during development. Certain drugs can disrupt the epigenetic machinery during these periods causing errors of development. Women who are trying to become pregnant or are pregnant should not be treated. Younger patients should also not be treated as they have developing germs cells in sensitive periods and the epigenetic reprogramming of these germ cells can potentially be affected as these drugs are circulated throughout the whole system potentially affecting every cell.</p></div>
