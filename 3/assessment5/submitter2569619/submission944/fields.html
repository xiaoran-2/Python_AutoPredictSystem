    <h1>Submission 944 from Anon (session_user_id: e5a30d44454fe9610e5e23a656d4f312112b3ba0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that belongs to DNA methyltransfereases inhibitors. It is incorporate into DNA, as a consequence are replication dependent, and acts as a hypomethylating agent. How the role of DNA methylation is context dependent, hypomethylation could drive tumor supressor genes to be expresed. This drug is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Generally, In normal cells CpG islands, found in many promoters, tend to be hypomethylated, and intergenic regions and repetitive elements usually are hypermethylated. This state help to maintain genomic stability.</p>
<p>However, in cancer cells this state is disrupted, there are a hypermethylation of CpG islands that silence the underlying gene. Among these silenced genes are tumor supressor genes that controlling cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. So, cells start to growth uncontrollably, become immortal, and DNA damages are not repair and starts tomurigenesis.</p>
<p>In respect to intergenic regions and repetitive elements, in cancer cells,  they are hypomethylated and cause genomic instability as deletions, reciprocal translocations or insertions that contribute to cancer or other diseases by lack, over- or underexpression of genes.</p>
<p>Is important to consider that the consequences of hypomethylation or hipermethylation is context dependent  and depends on location.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer. This cluster is paternally imprinted. In normal cells, on maternal allele the imprinted control region (ICR) is unmethylated. This ICR is bound by an insulator protein called CTCF and this binding is able to insulate Igf2 from downstream enhancers. On the allele, there is a long non coding RNA called H19, too. This H19 is a target for the enhancers because of chromating looping. It is happen when enhancers can not act on Igf2 due to the insulation by CTCF proteins.  On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated and the promoter of H19, too. So, H19 is silenced. There is not  an insulator protein on ICR, therefore, enhancers are free to act on Igf2. However, in cancer cells the imprinted control region is methylated on the maternal allele, too. Therefore maternal allele behave as paternal allele and there are overexpression of Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene, namely promoting growth and causes Willm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In diseases like cancer, produced by epigenetic alterations among other factors, the development of new drugs must take into account some very important points in order to that the treatments of patients are effective. </p>
<p>DNA methylation can affect only during individual lifetime or its lifetime and their offspring (inheritable). It depends on which type cell occur, either somatic or germ cell, respectively. Morever, in human life there are sensitive periods defined as a lapse of time during epigenetic marks are activelly remodeled. During these sensitive periods of prenatal (preimplantation and early postimplantation) and postnatal (primordial cells development) development, nutrition and other enviromental stimuli can alter the establishment of epigenetic gene regulation.</p>
<p>The changes that produce epigenetic drugs can contribute to express or silenced genes. Therefore, should not be used during periods when epigemona is being remodeled ie. sensitive periods, because could alter the individual epigenetic map causing diseases for him and their offspring. Some studies suggest that the action of these new drugs, although not completely effective in some cases, could sensitize tumor cells to conventional chemotherapy, for this to be more effective.</p>
