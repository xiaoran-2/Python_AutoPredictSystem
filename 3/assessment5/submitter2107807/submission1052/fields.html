<table width="725" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td class="xl65" style="width:725px;height:170px;">CpG  islands tend to occur at promoter sequences and methylation of CpG islands tends to silence the downstream gene(s). Accordingly, CpG island methylation is somewhat less extensive (hypomethylation) than at other loci to allow for the genes to be useful. In cancer cells, CpG islands tend more often to be hypermethylated than in normal cells, silencing the downstream gene(s).  If the silenced gene is in fact a tumor suppressor, or a regulator of an oncogene, then cancer is more likely to occur.   Conversely, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are typically hypermethylated in a normal cell. These regions generally contain miscellaneous junk that is not useful to the cell, such as transposons and obsolete or mutant versions of genes that have been replaced by better functional copies elsewhere. In cancerous cells, these regions tend to be hypomethylated relative to the situation in a normal cell, which has the effect of activating either transposons (which will increase the frequency of mutations as the transposons copy themselves into random new locations and possibly disrupt useful genes) or "bad" genes -   genes that were once helpful but no longer do good things. To the extent any of these disrupted genes are tumor suppressors, or any newly-activated genes are oncogenes or regulators of tumor suppressors, then cancer is more likely to occur.</td>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2, or insulin-like growth factor 2, is believed to be the principle growth factor expressed in fetuses. The paternally imprinted copy is typically methylated at the imprint control region (ICR) while the maternal copy is not. Normally, methylation of the paternal ICR prevents the transcriptional repressor CTCF from binding the ICF and results in methylation spreading to the nearby lncRNA H19 promoter, inactivating it. H19 is a reservoir for microRNAs. This allows the nearby enhancers on the paternal chromosome to activate Igf2. Meanwhile, on the maternal chromosome, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, and H19 remains active. As a result, the enhancers on the material chromosome are activated, but CTCF acts to insulate the maternal Igf2 from the enhancers, so maternal Igf2 remains inactive, and the enhancers act instead on H19. In Wilm's tumor of the kidney, a form of the Beckwith-Wiedeman imprinting disorder, Igf2 is overexpressed due to paternal disomy, loss of imprinting expression, or some other defect that causes the enhancers to overstimulate Igf2 production, and underproduce H19. As H19 restricts growth and Igf2 promotes growth, the overall effect is to promote growth, and in Wilm's syndrome, excessive growth in a child's kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a class of drugs called DNA-demethylating agents. Decitabine increases the likelihood that a given locus will be demethylated, and so will generally increase the transcriptional activity at the site. If the locus affected codes for is a tumor-suppressor gene, or a promoter or enhancer of a tumor suppressor gene, then its activity may slow or stop tumorogenesis.  According to the article, it appears likely that epigenetic changes caused by these drugs may also enhance the effects of existing therapies, getting a "two-for-one" benefit from their use. So far decitabine has only been approved for myelodysplastic syndromes, although it appears that azacitidine, another DNA-demethylating agent, may also be effective in solid tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation typically inhibits gene expression in its vicinity and thus alters cell function. It is chemically stable (unless acted upon by a demethylase) and so its effects can continue for the life of the cell.  It is also mitotically heritable (in part due to its attachment to chemically symmetric CpG groups, which permit methylation marks to be reliably copied during DNA duplication), and so its effects are generally replicated in the daughter cells of a cell treated with epigenetic drugs. A sensitive period is one in which significant epigenetic changes are occurring and so a time when things can easily go wrong.  The two most sensitive developmental periods are during germ cell development and during embryonic implantation (pre- through early-post-implantation). Treating patients during these periods would be more likely to disrupt general epigenetic programming, clearing and reprogramming processes and also to produce heritable (germ cell line) effects. At this point, it doesn't appear possible to precisely control where epigenetically active drugs work; they seem to work on a general process that is occurring in many cells and cell types simultaneously, so side effects would be likely.</p></div>
