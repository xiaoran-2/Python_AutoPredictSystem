    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands, found in the promoter regions of some genes, are unmethylated in normal cells. If the CpG islands are methylated, this would be to silence certain genes by condensing the chromatin via MeCP1 and MeCP2. In tumour cells, the CpG islands are hypermethylated to silence certain genes, especially tumour suppressor genes. Without expression of the tumour suppressor genes, the tumour cells are free to grow and divide.</p>
<p>In healthy cells, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are methylated to maintain genomic stability by preventing alternate splicing and transcription as well as transposition of certain genes. In tumour cells, most of the genome is hypomethylated, including the intergenic regions and repetitive elements. This increases genomic instability as genes can be translocated between repeats and chromosomes can be deleted, inserted or translocated. Cryptic promoters can also be expressed to rearrange the genome. Hence, genomic instability can damage the cell’s genome, producing a tumour cell which left unchecked can grow and divide.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting can be disrupted by altering DNA methylation in the ICRs of a locus in both homologous chromosomes. This will allow the locus of one chromosome to behave like the locus of the other homologous chromosome, underexpressing tumour suppressor genes or overexpressing growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>In healthy people, the homologous chromosomes of the H19/Igf2 locus differ in the ICR methylation. In the maternal chromosome, the ICR is unmethylated, allowing CTCF to bind to it. CTCF insulates Igf2 to prevent its expression, allowing the downstream enhancers to stimulate H19 expression. In the paternal chromosome, the ICR is methylated and spreads to the H19 promoter. This silences H19 expression, allowing the downstream enhancers to activate Igf2 expression.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICRs and the H19 gene in both homologous chromosomes are hypermethylated, preventing H19 from being expressed. The downstream enhancers in both homologous chromosomes can stimulate Igf2 expression, doubling the amount of Igf2 expressed. As Igf2 is a growth promoting gene, this will lead to Wilm’s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating drug and a nucleoside analogue. It is integrated into the DNA during DNA replication, where it irreversibly binds to DNMTs. This prevents DNMT from maintaining DNA methylation, particularly the CpG islands.</p>
<p>In tumour cells, CpG islands and shores are hypermethylated, inhibiting the expression of tumour suppressor genes. Given that small doses of Decitabine are used to inhibit DNMT specifically in tumour cells, as the cells divide, DNA methylation on the CpG islands is diluted as DNMT cannot maintain CpG island hypermethylation. As a result, tumour suppressor genes are expressed to inhibit tumour cell growth and division.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="Question"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">In tumour cells, DNA hypermethylation is passed from the parent cell to daughter cells via mitotic heritability. However, DNA methylation can be added or removed. Therefore, by inhibiting DNMTs, no new DNA methylation will be generated. Also, once DNA methylation is removed, they do not come back. Via mitotic heritability, the daughter cells will inherit decreased DNA methylation from the parent cell, so it will express genes that will arrest tumour cell growth and division and make them more susceptible to conventional chemotherapy. </span></p>
<p class="Question"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are cleared to achieve totipotency in cells. Sensitive periods include early development, when a zygote divides into a blastocyst, and primordial germ cell development, where epigenetic marks are cleared in germ cells as they develop into gametes. The latter period occurs in prepubescent children, so it is inadvisable to treat them with epigenetic drugs as it can affect how epigenetic marks and DNA methylation are cleared and reset in developing germ cells, especially imprinted genes. This can result in offspring whose cells all possess an altered epigenome, affecting how it grows, divides and functions which can result in imprinted disorders. </span></p></div>
