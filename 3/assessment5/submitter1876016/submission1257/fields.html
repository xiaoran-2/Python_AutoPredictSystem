    <div class="field-value"><p>Cells in the blastocyst have low DNA methylation and are capable of developing all of the characteristics of the individual’s DNA. This contrasts with adults whose cells are differentiated for specific functions. The differentiation into specialized cells is brought about by suppression of genes which are inappropriate for the particular cell type. The mechanism of suppression is associated with methylation at CpG islands, which leads to the formation of heterochromatin, and hence to silencing of genes not required for the cell to function. The regions of DNA which are required by the cell remain unmethylated.</p>
<p>Cancer is linked to hypermethylation at CpG islands, associated with excessive histone methylation and the silencing of  associated tumour suppressor genes, resulting in the rapid duplication of tumour cells.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are normally methylated and hence inactive but for them cancer is linked to hypomethylation. This is known to lead to chromosomal instability through insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations at intergenic regions and through recombinations and transpositions at repetitive elements. In adition, hypomethylation at CpG-poor promoters may lead to oncogene activation. Consequently the hypomethylated regions are likely to lead to the creation of cells with inherent and possibly cancer inducing defects.</p>
<p>Thus a combination of hypomethylation throughout the DNA, leading to faulty copying of cell types, and hypermethylation at CpG islands, which stops the suppression of these cells, is associated with cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is associated with hypermethylation at CpG islands and their shores, one example of this being Wilm’s tumour, which is caused by a loss of imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster.</p>
<p>In the case of the H19/Igf2 cluster, the paternal allele is methylated at H19 and at the input control region. This allows enhancers to act upon Igf2, which is growth promoting.</p>
<p>For the maternal allele H19 and the ICR are both unmethylated. This allows an insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR, which insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers and leaves it inactive.</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour there is a loss of imprinting and the maternal allele appears methylated  with the same pattern as the parental allele, with no CTCF binding. This means that Igf2 is expressed in both alleles, providing double the growth promotion. The loss of imprinting may be caused by mutation, uniparental disomy or more rarely by epigenetic disruption.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting is a common feature of cancer, and in this case the upregulation of Igf2, an oncogene, may lead to Wilm’s tumour of the kidney, which is found in childhood but not in adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. As the class name implies, it binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA upon replication, and so becomes more effective with each successive generation of cells.</p>
<p>It is believed to reduce the methylation at CpG islands and hence the silencing of tumour suppressor genes associated with these islands. The principal mechanism is demethylation of the DNA, which facilitates the change to active euchromatin in which the base pairs are open for chemical interactions. There may also be other positive effects from associated demethylation of histones.</p>
<p>As a consequence, successive generations of demthylated cells lead to a reduction, rather than growth, in the tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In mitosis, the reconstructed DNA of CpG regions will initially be hemi-methylated. However, the action of DNMT1 normally produces two methylated CG strands, leading to stable duplication of the CpG island. If cells within the tumour were demethylated, by the action of azacitidene, then cell division might lead to the disruption of this process and increased susceptibility of subsequent generations to the action of standard chemotherapy treatments.</p>
<p>Periods of epigenetic reprogramming are defined as sensitive periods. In mammals these are principally the two key stages of early development: from fertilization to implantation of the blastocyst and during formation of primordial germ cells within the developing foetus.</p>
<p>Dutch studies on human records suggest that there is a further “slow growth period” before sexual maturation which is sensitive to food supply. There may also be sensitive periods for particular organs, but neither of these suggestions is linked to understood mechanisms of genetic reprogramming.</p>
<p>Because epigenetic drugs are designed to bring about changes in epigenetic marks on the DNA they should not be given to pregnant females, most especially during the two key stages in early development, when they may interfere with the extensive reprogramming which is taking place. </p></div>
