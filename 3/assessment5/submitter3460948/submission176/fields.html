    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell the imprint control region on the paternal allele is methylated so that the insulator CTCF can not bind to it and so H19 is not expressed and enhancers that are downstream the H19 promote IGF2 expression. On the maternal allele the imprint control region is not methylated and can bind to the CTCF insulator element. When this happens enhancers promote H19 expression and maternal IGF2 is silent. In cancer cell both the paternal and the maternal imprint control regions are methylated and so that CTCF can not bind to it and H19 can not be expressed. As the result both IGF2 are expressed and its amount is doubled in comparison to its amount in normal cell. IGF2 is a growth promoting protein so its enhanced amount promote aberrant cell growth as observed in Wilm's tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal cell CpG islands that are mostly found in the promotors of the genes are not methylated . In almost all neoplastic cells these CpG islands in gene promotor regions are hypermethylated which means that such gene is silent - not expressed. And it is very likely that such hupermethylated CpG islands are located in the promotors of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes as clear from their name prevent the cell from neoplastic transformation: they could be growth suppressors or proapoptotic genes or thy could lead to the cell cycle arrest etc. So if several of them are silenced that contributes to the disease. On the other hand in normal cell the intergenic regions and repetetive elements are usually methylated to maintain genomic stability and silencing of cryptic transcription start sites and cryptic start sites. In cancer cell all these elements and intergenic regions are hypomethylated wich leads to illegitimate recombination between repeats or their activation. Both of these results in high genomic instability which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Illegitimate recombination can disrupt expression of tumor suppressing genes or actiate or duplicate oncogenes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA hypomethylating agent. It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.It functions in a similar manner to azacitidine, although decitabine can only be incorporated into DNA strands while azacitidine can be incorporated into both DNA and RNA chains. Decitabine is used for treating <span>myelodysplastic syndromes.</span> In cancer CpGs in many gene promotors are methylated, some of these genes are tumor suppressors, so when treated with Decitabine, these tumor suppressors are demethylated and can be expressed again. [Cancer and epigenetics., <span>Kantarjian H, Issa JP, Rosenfeld CS, </span><em>et al.</em><span> (April 2006).

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is inherited by daughter cells through cell division, so after treatment drug effect would last as it it will be passed through cell generations. </p>
<p>Sensitive period in terms of epigenetics is a period of time when the epigenetic marks are erased and then restablished. The sensitive periods in human development are the early preimplantation development of the embryo and the period of primordial germ cells development.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods are inadvisable because the drug change the epigenetic make up not only in target cells but in all sensitive cells.</p></div>
