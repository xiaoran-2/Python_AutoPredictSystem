    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>

    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic active drug <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">such(</span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"> histone-deacetylase-inhibitors) which act via </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">re-activation of large panel of genes including tumor suppressor genes responsible for cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in hematologic malignancies. The drugs have been well characterized as inhibitors of DNMTs (DNA methyl transferase), their application is promising because of their low toxicity to normal cells and their specific biological effects on a large number of cellular processes.Decitabine is used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes .As a nucleoside analogue incoperated into DNA replication , DNMT comes along to bind with DNMT1which bind to copy the methylation to the daughter strands. DNMT is bind irreversibly and can nolonger be released meaning DNMT is division dependent to help the cell replication .Decitabine belongs to a group of drugs called hypomethylating agents. Decitabine produces its anticancer effects by causing a chemical reaction that damages the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage caused by decitabine inhibits protein synthesis and results in cellular death.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.

</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p><span><span>Epigenetic drugs can alter tumour cells in some lasting way,</span> unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.The drugs inhibited tumor growth, lmplying that the demethylating drug had produce a memory antitumor response and gene activity was altered in stem cell-like cancer cell. Sensitive period is a period of epigenetic reprogramming,the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks in development it is the time when IVF and AC are coming into play and are being effective rather than being distructive.Treating during sensitive period is inadvisable because it is the period of epigenetic reprogramming so if you treat in this period the memory antitumor response that the cell has produced will be erased . </span></p></div>
