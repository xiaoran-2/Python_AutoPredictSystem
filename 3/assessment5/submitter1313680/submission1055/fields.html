    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation does not typically occur at CpG islands in cells of normal health.  In contrast, the hypermethylatation that can occur in CpG islands by cancerous cells disrupts normal processes by silencing genes that should have been euchromatic.  Meanwhile, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are being hypomethylated, (especially at repeats).  This can create incompatible recombination, (since genetic information that would otherwise be inaccessible is exposed during cell division), as well as deletions and insertions, genomic instability ensues.  In cancer, and other diseases, promoters that otherwise would be inactive can be 'turned on' by the removal of inherited methylation marks, causing activation of genes downstream that are detrimental to the organism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The methylated paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind, allowing enhancers to express Igf2, this is the only active copy in a normal paternal imprint.  The methylation also spreads downstream to H19.  The unmethylated maternal allele is the only one producing H19, with CTCF binding, which insulates Igf2 form downstream enhancers.  These enhancers then act upon H19.  Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is the phenotype associated with this particular issue, which can be due to uniparental paternal disomy, improper imprinting on the maternal allele, and rarely epigentic disruption creating a loss in imprinting.  CTCF cannot bind when methylated, enhancers are then able to express Igf3, causing growth promotion at one loci, while removing the offsetting growth suppression genes involved.  This commonly causes a pre-disposition to embryonic and childhood tumors, such as Wilm's tumor in the kidney. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the DNAMTi type of drugs.  It works by being incorporated into the DNA when it is replicating, creating an irreversible bond with DNMT.  These type of drugs rely on cell division to be effective, making them especially suitable for cancer treatments as cancer cells have a greater rate of cell division than their neighbors.  There may be other effects that are unknown at this time.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>These drugs alter the mechanisms themselves, when cells replicate they internalize some component that is then passed to all daughter cells, which alters the cells not just during treatment, but for all future generations.  It would be very concerning to use such treatments in a patient that is in a sensitive period, where the epigenetic marks that are needed to have good health are still being set.  These are times when the germline is setting methylation marks, such as in the blastocyst stage of development and during the pre-puberty stage when the next generation's codes are being set.  Care should also be taken when treating young patients, as the long term effects of these epigenetic treatments have not been well studied.  Many of the patients that have taken these drugs having already lived a large percentage of their lives and the impact of these drugs genome wide has not been well studied.</p></div>
