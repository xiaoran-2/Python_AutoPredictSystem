    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>CpG islands are found near the promoters of most genes. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides allows binding of meCpG binding proteins, which have a transcription repression domain, which prevents transcription, silencing the gene. Methylation can also prevent binding of transcription factors, which also leads to silencing of the gene. In cancer cells, CpG islands are hypermethylated, which leads to repression of the genes that they regulate. Many of these genes are tumour suppressors and abnormal methylation silences these genes, allowing tumorigenesis to occur. CpG island methylation in cancer cells increases with time. Repression of these genes leads to uncontrolled growth and division, and in many cases blocks apoptosis in these cells.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements silences these sequences. Methylation maintains genomic stability and also silences cryptic transcription and splicing sites, preventing transcriptional interference. Methylation of repetitive elements prevents the transposition of these elements, which also maintains genomic stability.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In cancer, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated, which leads to genomic instability as the activities of these sequences are not repressed. Transposition occurs and cryptic promoters disrupt normal gene expression which enhances tumorigenesis.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p dir="ltr"><span>The ICR (imprinting control region) of the paternal allele is methylated, which prevents binding of the CTFC protein to the ICR. The lack of binding means that the enhancers found in the cluster act on Igf2 rather than H19, causing the former to be expressed. In contrast, the ICR of the maternal allele is unmethylated, which allows the binding of CTFC. CTFC, when bound, prevents the enhancers acting on Igf2, and rather they act on H19, which causes it to be expressed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In Wilm’s tumour, the ICRs of both alleles are methylated, which prevents the binding of CTFC in the case of both alleles, which causes Igf2 to be overexpressed while H19 not to be expressed at all. Overexpression of IGf2, a growth promoter is associated with Wilm’s tumour.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine removes the methyl groups added to CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands and prevents additional groups form being added to the DNA, which cause the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. The removal of methyl groups will promote the transcription of these genes, which can reduce the growth of the tumour. The removal of DNA methylation is permament, so this eipgenome is passed onto daughter cells. The increased genomic instability of these daughter cells contributes to the slowing of the growth of the tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic mark due to the action of DNMT1, which methylates the daughter strand of hemimethylated DNA after DNA replication during cell division. Therefore, any alteration in the methylome of a cell will be transmitted to the daughter cells.</p>
<p>A sensitive period is a period of time during which epigenetic reprogramming is done (after fertilization and early embryogeneis and during the development of the germ cells). These periods are defined as sensitive because the epigenetic reprogramming can be affected by external factors. In the case of the development of germ cells, for females the sensitive period is during embryogenesis when the germ cells are formed, and for males the sensitive period is during early puberty (in humans between 9 and 12 years of age). Treatment during sensitive periods would affect the epigenomes of germ cells and epigenetics drugs that have a positive effect on cancer cells will have a negative effect on healthy cells (both somatic and germ lines) as they inhibit epigenetic machinery and the laying down of epigenetic marks. If this occurs in germs cells during their development, these will be passed on to future offspring.</p></div>
