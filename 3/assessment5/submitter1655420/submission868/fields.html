    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can be altered in different ways in cancer cells. Hypermethylations in case of CpG islands and hypomethylations of intergenic regions and repetitive elements, depending on the regions where they occur, could lead to genome instability and uncontrolled proliferation of cells.</p>
<p><strong>CpG islands are usually unmethylated</strong> and have no effect on the promoter’s state, which could be active or inactive. <strong>Cancerous cells</strong> can show <strong>hypermethylation</strong> at promoters’ CpG islands, which results in the related gene being silenced. This could lead to uncontrolled cell <strong>proliferation and genome alterations</strong> when this silencing due to CpG island methylation occurs in the promoters of <strong>tumor suppressor genes</strong>. Tumor suppressor genes can have different roles related to cell profileration, such as inhibition of cell division and initiation of apoptosis in case of excessive damage. Inadequate functioning of these genes can therefore contribute to the development of tumors.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in <strong>intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> serves the function of <strong>genomic stability</strong>, ensuring that there is no loss or gain of chromosomes or bad recombinations between which would result in an abnormal karyotype. Normally, repeats are <strong>methylated and heterochromatinized</strong> ensuring that only proper alignment between chromosomes is possible (e.g. 2-chromosome fitting with 2-chromosome but not with 15-chromosome). In <strong>cancerous cells, hypomethylation</strong> may occur, resulting in misalignments between chromosomes which lead to <strong>faulty recombinations</strong>. Hypomethylations can also lead to the <strong>activation of repeats</strong>, resulting in these regions being copied and transposing (i.e. jumping around within the genome and fitting themselves in at some location). Different problems can occur at the site where these copies jump in, as they could (in)activate genes or actually jump in the coding region itself, leading to different degrees of transcriptional aberrations with a wide array of potential effects on the cell and its surroundings. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer by affecting the amount of expression of a certain gene. The H19/Igf2 cluster which was covered in the video lecture provides an example of overexpression of a growth-promoting gene product due to hypermethylation of its imprint control region (ICR).</p>
<p>ICRs can be hypermethylated or hypomethylated, depending on their function. In a normal situation, the <strong>ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster is methylated</strong> on the<strong> paternal</strong> and <strong>unmethylated</strong> on the <strong>maternal allele</strong>. For the <strong>paternal allele</strong>, this results in enhancers binding on <strong>Igf2</strong>, which is <strong>expressed</strong>. The unmethylated ICR on the <strong>maternal allele</strong> cause CTCF insulator elements to bind, resulting in enhancers acting on H19, which implies that <strong>Igf2 is silent</strong>. The overall result from this methylation pattern is that an appropriate amount of Igf2 is expressed for the cell to function and grow appropriately. In <strong>Wilm’s tumour</strong>, there is a <strong>hypermethylation</strong> of the ICR on the <strong>maternal allele</strong> as well, resulting in enhancers binding on the maternal Igf2. This leads to a doubling of the expression of Igf2. This increase in Igf2 is associated to Wilm’s tumour as <strong>Igf2 is a growth-promoting factor</strong> similar in structure to insulin.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (azacitidine) belong to the class of “<strong>DNA-demethylating agents</strong>”. As its name implies, this class of epigenetic inhibitors counteracts the hypermethylation that can occur at certain sites along the genome in case of cancer.</p>
<p>Decitabine is chemically similar to cytidine (commonly abbreviated as ‘C’), one of the 5 nucleosides found in DNA and RNA (A-C-G-T/U). It causes <strong>hypomethylation of DNA</strong> by inhibition of the DNA methyltransferase.</p>
<p>The <strong>anti-tumour effect</strong> of decitabine (at lower doses) is a result of this hypomehylation, as tumours can no longer use hypermethylation to their benefit. An example can be found in question 1, as the <strong>hypomethylation of CpG</strong> islands by decitabine would allow for the <strong>expression of tumour suppressor genes</strong> which could inhibit further cell division or initiate apoptosis (amongst other effects).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can have <strong>long-lasting effect</strong> on tumours because the <strong>epigenetic changes</strong> corresponding to cancers are passed on to <strong>daughter cells</strong> and beyond. However, if these epigenetic <strong>modifications are removed</strong> (or restored to the ‘healthy’ state) by drugs, they will <strong>not reoccur </strong>after cell division. Even though these epigenetic drugs may not affect the viability of a tumour cell, they could have great effect on a tumour's growing ability.</p>
<p>One issue with using these drugs refers to ‘sensitive periods’. Ideally, the drug would only affect the tumour cells with little or no effect on healthy cells. However, there are a number of <strong>sensitive periods</strong> during the human life cycle, during which the use of these drugs is not advised. Particularly sensitive periods are periods of <strong>extensive epigenetic reprogamming</strong> (i.e. during <strong>embryonic development</strong> or during the production of <strong>germ cells</strong>).</p>
<p>Treatment of patients during these sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs would not be advised as these drugs could <strong>interfere with the growth or development</strong> of their (potential) <strong>offspring</strong>. For both male and female patients, <strong>infertility</strong> can be an issue. In addition, for female patients, these drugs should be avoided during <strong>pregnancy</strong> as they could affect the growing embryo. </p></div>
