    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in methylation in the DNA of cells are produced by cancer. Consequently, silence/expression of usually expressed/silenced genes in a normal cell can, for example, enhances the hability of growing of such cells over the normal cells.</p>
<p>In normal cells a CpG island is unmethylated if the respective gene is expressed and methylated if it is silenced. In cancer, CpG islands related with tumour suppressors or growth genes are methylated, so silenced.</p>
<p>In contrast repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually found methylated, so silenced. However, in cancer, this regions are found unmethylated. The main consequence of this is genomic instability. Due to repetitive elements, chromosomes mix with each other causing reciprocal translocations, for example.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the case of the cluster H19/lgf2 and in a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) of the paternal allele is methylated. The methylation expands to the promoter of the H19 gene and therefore, it is silenced. The result is that the enhancers can only act on the lgf2 gene. However, in the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF binds to it, so the promoter of the H19 gene is unmethylated. In this case the enhancers can not act on the lgf2 gene because CTCF inhibit it but they can act on the H19 gene because it is unmethylated. To sum up, in the paternal/maternal allele the gene H19 is silenced/expressed and the lgf2 gene is expressed/silenced.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumour the imprinting is lost therefore both alleles are methylated and behave as paternal allele. This causes an overexpression of lgf2 (double dose than in a normal cell) which is associated with growth promotion.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, a drug that reduces methylation in the DNA. As we have seen, it is know that cancer is associated with methylation of CpG islands of tumour suppressors or with methylation of imprint control regions (ICR). Therefore, demethylation of this areas of the genome have an anti-tumour effect because they recover its initial state.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Methylation of the DNA is heritable, it is passed from a mother cell to its daugthers. So, when a treatment that has modified the methylation of the DNA is given up its effects can endure generations of cells after the one that recieved it. For that reason, it should be contraindicated taking this drugs in sensitive periods. This are the ones when epigenetic reprogramming in the genome is taking place, for example in an embryo or in the formation of germ cells. If this reprogramming of epigenetic marks (methylation specifically) is altered in some way its non-desired changes in otherwise healthy embryonic or germ cells will be passed through the subsequently cell generations.</p></div>
