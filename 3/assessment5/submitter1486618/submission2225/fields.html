DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is one of the regulators of gene transcription. A</span>bout 70-80% of all CpG dinucleotides are methylated in mammals. In mammalian genomes, CpG islands are typically 300-3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately 60% of promoters  of genes. They have a high CpG density and are usually kept free of methylation independent of their activity state.</p>
<p>Aberrant DNA methylation patterns - hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue - have been associated with a large number of human malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.</p></div>
