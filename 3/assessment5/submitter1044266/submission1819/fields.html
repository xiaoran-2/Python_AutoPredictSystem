<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general the genome not just made of CPG island but most of the genome made of repetitive  element and intergenic region this is anther places where you can found CpG were methylated in normal cells, but in cancer these region( RE and IR) tende to be hypomethylated, so thy have less methylation what we see in normal ceels.</p>
<p> The function of the DNA methylation was maintain genomic stability ( genetically the genome was normal) no loss or gain chromosome or have illegitimate recombination between repeats. In normal cell this type of recombination between repeats would not happened because repeats will be heavily methylated and also hetrochromtized.</p>
<p>In cancer cell If we have hypomethylation of repeats or Intergenic region the recombination will occur due to hypomethylation on repeats or intergneic region and then causing genomic instability.  </p>
<p>So in context of cancer, we have hypomethylation (less methylation) of this  repetitive element and intergenic region and the recombination can occur because they no  </p>
<p>The repeats can also be activated because of hypomethylation, this means the repeats has the capacity to make copy of themselves and jump around the genome  or transpose this can result in consequence problem where they jump to, because cause  disrupt of coding region of the gene and also  may activate neighbouring  gene</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So what happen in cancer the CpG poor promoter become Hypomethylated  and this is association  with activation of associated gene. Example: activation oncogene R-Ras gene in gastic cancer, because 1 hypomethylation of CpG poor promoter, other example activate MicroRNA (miR2) that target tumor suppresser PTEN and silencing in tumor suppresser . </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deleltion of Dnmt1 can enhance or suppress tumourigenesis</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some tumor are driven by tumour suppresser Hypermethylation that making the continuing cell divided rapidly, then depletion of DNA methylation appears to suppress tumourigenesis, but on contrast some Type of cancer are driven by chromosomal instability this case if you depleted DNAmethylation you have exacerbating the geneome-wid Hypomethylation which contributed chromosomes at instability and enchance tumourigenesis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So alteration in DNA methylation at ICRs ( Hypo or Hypermethylatin), can result in loss of expression of growth restrictions genes, cover expression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We don’t find exclusively Hypomethylation on imprinting control region ICRs in cell cancer .</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We would like to start with Hypomethylation in ICRs one normal cell with specific example such H19/1gf2 cluster.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal cell, in case of Igf2 gene, the ICRs of this gene, if its methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele means unmethylated CTCF binding insulator element , so in this case the enhancers activate H19 but igf2 will be silence from maternal allele and no  expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On paternal allele because the ICRs methylated the enhancers can active Igf2 because the CTCF can not bind to insulate this, so the iGf2 expressed from paternal allele.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In cancer cell with loss of imprinting we have Hypermethylation of ICRs on maternal allele as well cause expression of Igf2, on maternal</p>
<p>now we have double dose of Igf2 on comparison with what we have seen in normal cells and because Igf2 is growth promoting cause W. tumor, so this specific example show a loss of printing is observed very wide-range of tumor types.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All nucleoside analogue, they are incorporated into DNA in the time of replication so when the DNA methyletransferase ( DNMT comes to bind that nucleotide to copy the methylation to daughter strand that Dnmt bind irreversibly and can no longer be released.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the cancer cell will be more affected because divided much rapidly and replicated more. For example Decitabine …drugs is DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Decitabine is indicated for treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). It is a chemical analogue of cytidine, a nucleoside present in DNA and RNA. Cells in the presence of Decitabine incorporate it into DNA during replication andRNA during transcription. The incorporation of Decitabine into DNA or RNA inhibits methyltransferase thereby causing demethylation in that sequence. This adversely affects the way that cell regulatory proteins are able to bind to the DNA/RNAsubstrate.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) . Furthermore, differentiation specific demethylation was observed in hematopoietic progenitors  and in murine erythroid progenitors, which was associated with high DNA replication rates, arguing for a mechanism of passive demethylation  The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes – controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair – by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands  Interestingly, no global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach </p></div>
