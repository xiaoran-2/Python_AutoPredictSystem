    <h1>Submission 344 from Anon (session_user_id: e015779ed43d40450bc4b19f5fe43794ee39fc03)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dectiabine is a DNA-demethylating agent. Decitabine works by reducing the methylation of DNA in the cancer cells. Thus this will reduce the hypermethylation of the CpG islands which can lead to the reactivation of some genes that were deactivated by the hypermethylation. Some of these genes might be tumour suppressor genes, hence in activating them, it can have an anti-tumour effect.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The imprint control region of the paternal allele is normally methylated, hence the enhancers can act on Igf2, thus Igf2 is expressed in the paternal allele. On the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated, thus it can bind an insulator element which result in the enhancers acting on H19 and not Igf2, thus Igf2 will not be expressed.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, this methylation pattern is disrupted and the imprint control region on both alleles are methylated resulting in an overexpression of Igf2 and no expression of H19. This thus contributes to diesease as Igf2 is growth promoting thus resulting in tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands silences gene expression.In cancer, CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation usually occurs at CpG islands near promoters of tumour suppressor genes. Thus with this hypermethylation, these genes are silenced thus contributing to cancer formation. DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements serve to maintain genetic stability. DNA methlyation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements are reduced in cancer. DNA hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements in cancer cells result in DNA instability, ie recombination between repeats and activation of repeats and transposition. It can also lead to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes via micro RNAs</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The modification of the DNA methylation will be preserved when the cells divide as DNA methyltransferase 1 will copy the methylation pattern of the DNA onto the new strand of DNA produced, hence preserving the epigenome. A sensitive period is one where the cells are undergoing epigenetic reprogramming. The two sensitive periods are just after fertilization and during mid-gestation. It is not advisable as the epigenome is being reprogrammed hence any epigenetic modification is likely to be erased or affect many cells and not just the cancel cells.</p></div>
