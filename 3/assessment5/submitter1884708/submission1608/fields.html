    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, there is usually hypomethylation at CpG islands and usually hypermethylation at the intergenic areas and repeats. In a cancer cell, there is usually hypermethylation at CpG islands (in the promoters of tumor-suppressor genes) and hypomethylation in the intergenic areas and repeats. Lack of methylation at intergenic regions and repeats can lead to genomic instability. CpG island hypermethylation, which is mitotically heritable, can silence tumor-suppressor genes, which could be one insult that could contribute to tumor formation. Tumor-suppressor hypermethylation happens more often than genetic mutations do, and which CGI is hypermethylated depends upon the tumor type. As cancer advances, so does this DNA methylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Under normal circumstances, on the maternal allele, the imprint control region is unmethylated and bound by CTCF, which insulates Igf2 from enhancers. Meanwhile, under normal circumstances, on the paternal allele, there is DNA methylation at the ICR, and it has a silencing affect. So, on the maternal allele,  H19 ends up acting on the enhancers, which loop back onto it instead of Igf2. And, on the paternal allele, the enhancers act on Igf2, an oncogene, which promotes growth. If you have a loss of imprinting, you get overexpression of growth-promoting genes (or loss of suppressor genes), and you basically end up with two alleles that act like the paternal allele. This leads to too much growth, which contributes to disease (Wilm’s tumor).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, which means that it’s a DNA-demethylating compound. DNMT inhibitors like decitabine get incorporated into the DNA. When a DNA methyltransferase comes over to bind with the DNA, where the inhibitor is, the DNA methyltransferase gets locked in and can’t go off to methylate DNA. The idea is that if you can stop the methylation of DNA, perhaps you can restore function to the gene at issue. Now, these DNMT inhibitors work during cell replication. Cells that are proliferating rapidly (i.e, cancer cells), presumably, are more affected than normal cells. However, we don’t know about the long-term effects of these DNMT inhibitors on noncancerous cells, which do eventually divide as well.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If an epigenetic drug is acting on rapidly proliferating cells, and DNA methylation is (as we know it is) mitotically heritable, that means that the future generations of those cells can therefore be altered by that initial administration of the compound.  By “sensitive period” we mean periods during development when epigenetic marks are being laid down or removed, such as during early embryonic development and during development of the gametes. You wouldn’t want to alter DNA methylation with such a compound during those times because you wouldn’t want to interfere with the natural epigenetic machinery that is doing important work.</p></div>
