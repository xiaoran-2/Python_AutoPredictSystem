    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

    <div class="field-value"><p>In cancer cells an inversion of the normal DNA methylation pattern can be observed. While normally heavily methylated areas like intergenic regions and repetitive elements lose their methylation, normally unmethylated regions like CpG islands are getting hypermethylated. This inversion contributes to the survival and proliferation of cancer cells by shutting down cell growth regulation mechanisms and by increasing genomic instability. </p>
<p>The suppression of cell growth regulation mechanisms happens via hypermethylation of CpG islands. The CpG islands are clusters of Cytosin-Guanin dinucleotides (connected via a phosphate), which can often be found in promoters for tumor suppressing genes, so when  these normally unmethylated and active regions get methylated in cancer cells they are silenced and subsequently the tumor suppressing genes are no longer expressed. </p>
<p>Genomic instability in cancer cells is promoted by the hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements. In normal cells these areas are shut down and inaccessible due to methylation, this reduces the risk of improper chromosome alignment and subsequently illegitimate recombination during mitosis and therefore contributes to genomic stability. In cancer cells these areas are no longer inaccessible and lead to all kinds of chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore the hypomethylation and therefore reactivation of normally silenced regions can also lead to the (over)expression of oncogenes.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Wilm's tumor develops because both alleles, maternal and paternal, of the H19/Igf2 cluster express the Igf2 gene, which is normally not the case, only the paternal allele is supposed to produce the growth factor Igf2.  </p>
<p>In the H19/Igf2 cluster an imprinting control region (ICR) lies between the Igf2 gene and some enhancers that can activate Igf2 expression. The methylation state of this ICR decides whether Igf2 is expressed or not.</p>
<p>In the maternal allele the ICR is supposed to be unmethylated, it acts as a binding region for an insulator protein (CTCF) that constitutes a barrier between the Igf2 gene and the enhancers. They can no longer activate Igf2 expression and instead propagate the expression of another gene (H19) that lies between the ICR and the enhancers. In the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, so the CTCF cannot bind to the region, subsequently there is no obstacle between enhancers and Igf2, the Igf2 gene is expressed.</p>
<p>In patients with Wilm's tumor the ICR is methylated in both alleles, so the maternal allele "behaves" like the paternal allele, they both express the oncogene Igf2, the double dose of this growth factor leads to the formation of the tumor.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (like the very similar substance Vidaza) is one of the first FDA approved drugs that affects the epigenetic processes. It is a DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor and therefore causes hypomethylation by irreversibly binding DNMT.</p>
<p>The exact mechanisms how the drug works and how specific it is, are not entirely known, especially negative long term effects (e.g. genome-wide hypomethylation is known to cause genomic instability) on normal cells cannot be excluded. However two modes of action are believed to be at work, the hypomethylation might prevent the silencing of tumor suppressor genes that usually occurs in cancer cells and especially at higher dosage the substance is cytotoxic. Since the drug's effect is replication dependent, cells with high division rates (like cancer cells) are more severely affected.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects beyond the period of treatment because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and if such a drug is applied during sensitive periods of development its effect can even be generation-spanning.</p>
<p>Mitotic heritability is explainable by the function of DMNTs. During replication the original two (methylated) DNA strands separate and the complimentary (unmethylated) DNA strands are produced. Afterwards the maintenance DMNTs check for hemi-methylated DNA and modify it to ensure that both strands are methylated in the same way. So DNA methylation is not diluted during mitosis, the daughter cells have the same methylation patterns as the original cell.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are times when epigenetic reprogramming occurs, this happens during early embryonic development and during the formation of the primordial germ cells. At these stages epigenetic markers are removed to allow the formation of totipotent cells which become the basis for all the differentiated cell types in the new organism.</p>
<p>Substances that interfere with epigenetic (re)programming can lead to improper silencing or activation of genes, to imprinting errors and to genomic instability. In the worst case this treatment could affect 3 generations at once (e.g. pregnant mother, baby in her uterus and the primordial germ cells in the baby)</p>
