    <div class="field-value"><p>According to Knudson hypothesis cancer is the result of diverse failures in DNA. But we can find some characteristics common in all cancers.</p>
<p>If we have a look inside the genome we can resume the regions in three groups:</p>
<p>-          Genes: that contains information to produce proteins</p>
<p>-          Intergenic regions: as the name indicates regions between two genes</p>
<p>-          Repetitive elements: regions that we can find lot of times in the genome</p>
<p>Those regions are modulates by epigenetic factors, as methylation. Methylation  regulates the genetic expression by two ways. The first one because maintain the chromatine in the close structure and the second one because inhibit that transcription factors join with chromatine.</p>
<p>That’s why methylation play an important role in studies against cancer, because is one mechanism of regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>In normal cells we will find intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements (but not CpG islands) methylated, meaning these regions are inactive. It doesn’t occur the same with CpG islands (regions near tumour suppressor gene’s promoter) that are not methylated, so activated.</p>
<p>In cancerit happens the opposite thing; intergenic regions, introns and repetitive elements (but not CpG islands) are not methylated (heterochromatine hipomethylation that causes genomic instability), but CpG islands are methylated (hypermethylation of CpG islands) so suppressor promoter genes are inactivated.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It seems to be relationship between Igf2 (Insuline Growth Factor 2) a gene that play an important role in fetal development and H19, a gene that codify for a noncoding RNA.</p>
<p>In normal cell the gene Igf2 from father locus is active, this fact made that upstream H19 sites are methylated, making H19 parental locus inactive. This fact generates a positive response to cell growth. In the other hand, the Igf2 from mother locus is inactive so there are not methylation upstream H19 gene, what it means that maternal H19 gene is active and it will regulate cell growth (less cell growth).</p>
<p>In Wilm’s tumour cell, the paternal Igf2 gene is active and H19 inactive, as in normal cell, but maternal pattern is changed. Igf2 is active so H19 is inactive. This fact produces a high cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we know, cancer is the effect of diverse failure in DNA (Knudson hypothesis).</p>
<p>Decitabine is one DNA demethylating agent capable to remove methyl groups from DNA, during replication, and cancer cells are the most replicative cells in the body.</p>
<p>Some epigenetic studies with AML patients showed that leukemognesis was stopped by decitabine because this leukomogenesis is produced by aderrant DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Also we need to know that CpG islands in tumour cells are hypermethilated so decitabine can play an important role in cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>As we know acetilation is related with activation of genes, so an histone- deacetilase inhibitor (DACi) produce that some genes are more active, as tumour supressors.</p>
<p>In the other hand if we combine this fact with an DNA- demethylating agent, as azacitidine, that stop aberrant DNA methylation it mades cancer cells more vulnerable to recover their initial non aberrant state.</p>
<p>But we need to be carefull with using this type of combinations because we don’t know what kind of effects can cause in the DNA in the future. So we need to identify sensitive periods in human bodies (those periods were the genome is most sensitive to changes in the environtment because there are active periods of remodeling genome) and try to avoid treat patients in this periods.</p>
<p>In humans those sensitive periods are the same as Assertive Reproductibe Technologies (IVF) and there are two:</p>
<p>-          Period of primordial germ cell development</p>
<p>-          Preimplantation and early post implantation period</p>
<p>Treating patients that are pregnant and pregnancy is in these periods can affect the baby or next generation in the future.</p></div>
