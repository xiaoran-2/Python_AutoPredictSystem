    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p>            When considering DNA methylation and its role in cancer, it is important to remember that, depending on the context, both the addition of methylation and the removal of methylation can have an adverse effect. CpG islands, some imprint control regions, intergenic regions, and repetitive elements all play a role in cancer depending of their methylated state.</p>
<p>Methylation of DNA can occur normally at cytosine/guanine pairs. The cytosine is a symmetrical dinucleotide, which allows for this epigenetic mark to be passed on through DNA replication with the help of DNA methyltransferase enzymes. CpG pairs are often clustered near a gene promoter and are generally un-methylated. When these CpG pairs do become methylated however, they most often lead to silencing of that gene. While there are a few instances where methylation of these islands is considered part of normal development, hypermethylation at these loci is often associated with cancer. Hypermethylation of certain tumor suppressor genes causes silencing of these genes leading to the absence of these tumor suppressor proteins. Without these proteins, cancer cells can grow rapidly and unhindered. These instances of hypermethylation are additionally rapidly passed on to daughter cells due to their mitotic heritability.</p>
<p>DNA CpG pairs at intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated in normal development, which silences these areas preventing transposition, transcriptional interference, and illegitimate recombination. When these regions are left unmethylated, these hypomethylated states often allowed for these adverse effect to occur which can contribute to cancer and tumor growth.  A varied amount of adverse effects can occur in these instances. Repetitive elements may not be silenced leading to incorrect dosages of particular proteins, DNA may become misplaced, or even deleted entirely. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have lasting effects on the genome because of its heritability. Enzymes like DNMTs that target hemi-methylated DNA are responsible for copying these marks from mother to daughter strands. Sensitive periods for epigenetics programming occur when epigenetic marks are being removed and reset, including in germ cell development and early development. It would be inadvisable to treat a patient with these epigenetic inhibitors during a sensitive period because the mechanisms of theses drugs are often not specific to diseased cell types. Drugs, such as Decitabine, that depend on replication for an effect to occur will have the greatest effect on rapidly reproducing cell types, like cancer cells, but almost all cells do undergo replication and this leaves a large amount of possibility for an error to occur in a normal cell types. During the sensitive periods, these errors are even more likely to be passed on to future generations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         Many forms of cancer display loss of imprinting, which means that alterations in the methylation patterns can occur on either the maternal or paternal allele. In the H19/Igf2 cluster, Igf2 is normally expressed in the paternal allele and H19 by the maternal allele. The paternal allele is methylated and thereby blocks a protein called CTCF from binding. This allows the downstream enhancers to act on their preferred Igf2. The H19 gene is methylated in the paternal allele due to heterochromatin spreading from the previous methylation. This methylation on the H19 gene occurs at a CpG island and leads to silencing. The maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by the CTFC protein. This blocks the enhancers and causes them to act instead on the H19 gene.</p>
<p>         Wilm’s tumour occurs when the maternal allele expresses the same methylation patterns as the paternal allele. This leads to a double dose of Igf2 and a lack of H19, which is tumor growth promoting. This specific hypermethylation generally occurs early in development and in fact Wilm’s tumour is a childhood kidney tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of Myeodiplastic Syndrome. It is classified as a DNAmethyltransferase inhibitor. These drugs are incorporated in DNA and bind irreversibly to DNAmethyltransferases during replication. As cancer cells are rapidly replicating, they are more strongly targeted than normal cells, but it can be assumed some effect will take place whenever there is DNA replication. The use of Decitabine for the treatment of tumors is still being researched, but it seems that these drugs make tumor cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. It has been observed that these drugs are often associated with hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, which may also help to explain this effect.</p>
