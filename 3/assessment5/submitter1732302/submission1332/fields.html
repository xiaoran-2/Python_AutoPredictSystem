    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5-position cytoseine in DNA and is carried out by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT's). DNA methylation is an essential process in epigenetics that ensures genomic stabilty and regulates normal gene expression. Normally there is no methylation at CpG islands.  CpG islands are regions of the genome in which cytosine and guanine are bridged with a phosphodiester.  They tend to be located near transcription start sites and are associated with gene promoters.  There <em>is</em> methylation further down the chromosome, at introns and intergenic and repetitive regions. An exeption to this rule is X-inactivation, when DNA methylation <em>does</em> occur at CpG islands and hence silences genes on of the X chromosomes at gastulation. This is a necessary process however.  </p>
<p>In cancer cells,  CpG islands (this having nothing to do with x-inactivation) are methylated while introns and intergenic and repetitive regions are turned off.  Hypermethylation of CpG sites within promoters of genes can lead to gene silencing, specifically tumor suppressor genes.  The tumor suppressor genes play an essential role in controling genes.  Apoptosis, the programmed dying of genes, stops,  and the defective genes multiply with no checks.   Hypomethylation at the intergenic and repetitive regions can cause oncogene activation by allowing cancer genes that are normally silenced to to grow and multiply unchecked, a phenomenon that does not exist in normal methylation patterns.  Hypomethylation at intergenic and repetive regions also leads to genomic instablity.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, called an antimetabolite, is a deoxyribonucleoside.  It inhibits DNA methytransferase (DNMT) and can be incorporated only into the DNA strands (as opposed to both DNA <em>and</em> RNA).   Decitabine demethylates regions that were previously being methylated and hypomethylates DNA.  Methylated  CpG islands silence tumor suppressor genes.  The Decitabine would demethylate the CpG islands  and subsequently activate tumor suppressor genes. Apoptosis recommences, which helps stop the (previously) unchecked growth of cancer cells.  Hence the drug helps reverse the methylation causing the cancer.  From what I have read, AZA (Azacitidine),a similar drug and a ribonucleoside, is slightly more effective because it can be incorporated both on DNA and RNA.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The epigenetic shifts that caused cancer are reversible.  Hence when drugs that alter DNA methylation are used, they are able to change the make up of the genes they are targeting.  The hope is that the drugs can work on the global genome or on a specific locus. If the drugs do not kill the cancer cells, perhaps they can make them open to chemical changes that can eventually change their function; and hence make them mor susceptible to standard chemotherapy.  There are times when it is inadvisable to use such drugs, the sensitive periods, which are during primordial germ cell development and early embryonic development.  Were a woman pregnant, then the child would in turn be open to epigenetic changes that could affect his/her health later on.  Likewise, there are times when the cancer cells are growing that make them more susceptible the therapies being used.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This is an example of imprinting, a process in which one gene is expressed (monoallelic gene expression) because of DNA methylation and histone modulation. The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of disrupted imprinting.  Normally the imprint control region (ICR) on the paternal allele is methylated.  Because nothing is binding on the ICR, the H19 is turned off and the enhancers act on and promote Igf2.  On the maternal allele, the ICR is <em>not</em> methylated and <em>is</em> bound by CTCF, an insulator protein.  It insulates the Igf2 from the downstream enhancers, silencing the Igf2.   The enhancers act on the H19 and it is activated.  Hence on the maternal allele, the Igf2 is <em>not</em> active and on the paternal allele it <em>is</em> active.  In the case of Wilm's tumor, the ICR is methylated on <em>both</em> alleles; there is no CTFC binding the maternal ICR.  Hence there a double dose of Igf2 is activated, no H19 is silenced and Wilm's tumor results.  </p></div>
