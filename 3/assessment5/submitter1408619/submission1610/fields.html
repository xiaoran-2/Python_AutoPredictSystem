    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are DNA regions with high content of the sequence CpG, which are usually found in the promoter regions of genes. Although most CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the Cytosine base, CpG islands generally exhibit no methylation. In many types of cancers, however, CpG islands and neighbouring regions (island shores) appear as heavily methylated. This hypermethylation implies the silencing of the corresponding gene, which may disrupt some biochemical pathways. If the gene is a tumor suppressor gene, it usually leads to tumor development and the advancement of the cancer disease.</p>
<p>In contrast, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are generally methylated in normal cells. This epigenetic modification enforces genome stability by preventing the open exposure of these DNA regions, whose genetic sequence is highly nonspecific and thus prone to illegitimate recombination between wrong chromosome strands during DNA replication. In most types of cancers, however, it has been found that these regions are much less methylated. This leads to chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations, insertions or deletions, which in turn can drastically alter the expression of some genes. When an oncogene is activated in this way, or a tumor suppressor gene is silenced, a tumor usually advances to a more malignant state.</p>
<p>It is then clear that the role of disrupted DNA methylation in cancer is dependent on the region of DNA where the hyper- or hypomethylation takes place.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The paternal allele is normally methylated at the ICR (Imprint Control Region) of the H19/lgf2 cluster. This methylation blocks the binding of the insulator protein CTCF, which allows some downstream enhancers to activate the expression of the Igf2 protein. By contrast, the maternal allele is not methylated at the ICR. This favors the binding of the insulator CTCF, which in turn silence the enhancers and inhibit the expression of Igf2. In summary, imprinting at this cluster makes the protein Igf2 to be expressed only from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In the case of Wilm's tumor, the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated. This aberrant hypermethylation results in the same pattern of protein expression as in the case of the paternal allele. That is, Igf2 is expressed from both alleles, which produces an overdosage of this growth factor. The Igf2 behaves in this case as an oncogene, favoring the abnormal growth of some cells in the early stages of development of the individual, resulting in cancer. Wilm's tumor is in fact a kind of kidney cancer which usually develops in children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor. DNMT is an enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to DNA during DNA replication and therefore it plays an important role in the mitotic inheritance of this kind of epigenetic information. Decitabine works as a nucleoside which permanently binds the DNMT molecule to the DNA, thus blocking from that moment its enzymatic activity. The result is a nonspecific hypomethylation of DNA in new somatic cells.</p>
<p>Tumor cells reproduce much more than normal cells. Their abnormal reproduction rate may have been favored by the silencing of a tumor suppressor gene through DNA hypermethylation of its promoter. In that case, Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect, because the subsequent demethylation will result in an increased expression of the tumor suppressor gene in the new generations of cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a kind of epigenetic mark which is permanent, which the exception of some periods of epigenetic reprogramming during the early stages of development of the embryo. It is mitotically heritable, which implies that all generations of daughter cells will also have the same pattern of DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation may thus be long-lasting or even irreversible in the cell and its generations of daughter cells. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are lapses of time in which epigenetic marks are erased and rebuilt. They take place during the first days or weeks of development of the embryo. They are very dependent on the type of cell (germ or somatic), on the target tissue, on the parent-of-origin and on the kind of epigenetic mark. As a general rule, somatic cells have one cycle of epigenetic reprogramming before cell differentiation, whereas primordial germ cells endure two cycles.</p>
<p>Treating patients with drugs which have wide effects on the epigenome does not seem advisable when they could affect the sensitive periods in the development of an embryo. If the drug is administered to a pregnant woman, it could reach the embryo and have strong adverse effects on its development.</p></div>
