    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>At CpG islands levels of DNA methylation are generally low, regardless of whether the underlying gene is active or silenced.  Thus this mechanism is not used for gene regulation at CGIs to a major extent, though it has a silencing effect where present.  In cancer, the CGIs (and sometimes also the adjacent CpG island shores) become increasingly hypermethylated as the tumour progresses, an effect seen originally in colorectal cancer and subsequently confirmed in other pathologies including glioma and breast cancer.  This inappropriately silences genes whose expression is vital for health, including tumour suppressor genes, facilitating cancer progression.</p>
<p>The situation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is in several respects the inverse of CGIs.  DNA methylation levels are normally kept high, to silence genes in these regions and stabilise them as heterochromatin.  In cancer, they become progressively hypomethylated in all tumour types so far tested.  The resulting more open euchromatin structure is associated with genomic instability, by mechanisms including facilitiating illegitimate recombination and transposition of repeats, and activating cryptic promoters for oncogenes with deleterious effects (such as R-RAS).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele, methylation and silencing of the H19 imprint control region allows expression of downstream enhancers which activate Igf2 expression.  In the maternal allele, the H19 ICR is unmethylated and the CTCF insulator protein is able to bind and inactivate Igf2.  In Wilm's tumour the H19 ICR becomes hypermethylated, causing the maternal allele to resemble the normal paternal allele.  Igf2 expression is thus activated on both alleles, leading to overexpression of this insulin-like growth factor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor.  Like azacitidine it is based on a 1,3,5-triazinone structure in which the carbon at the 5-position of a cytosine base is replaced by nitrogen; they differ in the sugar portion, with azacitidine having a ribose and decitabine a 2'-deoxyribose.  The drugs mimic deoxycytidine well enough to be incorporated into DNA stands.  Methylation is chemically blocked by the 5-aza modification; instead, DNMT may bind irreversibly at this part of the DNA strand and become inactivated (details still unclear).  Reduced levels of active enzyme reduce DNA methylation globally.  Hypermethylation of GpG islands is thus less likely, and there is less inactivation of tumour suppressor genes than in an untreated cancer patient, slowing disease progression.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically stable: after DNA replication, methylated CpG regions on the old strand are mirrored onto the new strand by action of DNMT1, so these markers persist through many somatic cell generations.  Epigenetic reprogramming requires removal of the methyls, either actively by enzymatic hydroxylation to unstable hydroxymethylcytosine, or passively by dilution of marker during multiple cell divisions in the absence of DNMT1.  Such reprogramming is concentrated into relatively brief "sensitive periods" when old methyl signals are cleared before new ones are laid down.  One such period is in the early embryo, when methylation goes through a minimum at the blastocyst stage.  Another is in primordial germ cells prior to gamete formation.  Exposure to non-specific epigenetic drugs such as azacitidine during these periods might be expected to disrupt the resetting of epigenetic marks, and hence of cell differentiation.  Treatment of pregnant women with such drugs is therefore hazardous, affecting embryo formation in early pregnancy and PGCs later in pregnancy.  In girls there is an additional sensitive period pre-puberty, when PGCs are present in the maturing ovaries.</p></div>
