    <div class="field-value"><p><span> <span>Mammalian cells possess the capacity to epigenetically modify their genomes via the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of the cytosine ring within the context of the CpG dinucleotide. A<span>pproximately 70% of the CpG residues in the mammalian genome are methylated. </span></span>In mammals, methylation is found sparsely but globally, distributed in definite CpG sequences throughout the entire </span><span class="ontologyTermLink">genome</span><span>, with the exception of CpG islands, or certain stretches (approximately 1 kilobase in length) where high CpG contents are found. The methylation of these sequences can lead to inappropriate gene </span><span class="glossaryTermLink">silencing</span><span>, such as the </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a title="silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells" href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Tumor-Suppressor-TS-Genes-and-the-Two-887">silencing of <span class="ontologyTermLink">tumor suppressor</span>genes in <span class="ontologyTermLink">cancer</span> cells</a>.</span></p>

<p>In healthy cells, CpG dinucleotides of lower densities are found within coding and <a title="Noncoding DNA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncoding_DNA">non-coding</a> intergenic regions.

<p> </p>
<p>The entire genome of a cancerous cell contains significantly less <a class="mw-redirect" title="Methylcytosine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylcytosine">methylcytosine</a> than the genome of a healthy cell. In fact, cancer cell genomes have 20-50% less methylation at individual CpG dinucleotides across the genome.<sup class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics#cite_note-HermanBaylin2003-5">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics#cite_note-FeinbergTycko2004-6">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics#cite_note-EggerLiangAparicio2004-7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_epigenetics#cite_note-Esteller2005-8">[8]</a></sup> In cancer cells “global hypomethylation” due to disruption in <a title="DNA methyltransferase" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methyltransferase">DNA methyltransferases</a> (DNMTs) may promote <a class="mw-redirect" title="Mitotic recombination" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitotic_recombination">mitotic recombination</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Chromosome rearrangement" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_rearrangement">chromosome rearrangement</a>, ultimately resulting in <a title="Aneuploidy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneuploidy">aneuploidy</a> when the chromosomes fail to separate properly during <a title="Mitosis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis">mitosis</a>.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;

    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.

CTCF can no longer bind to the insulator, and so the enhancer is now free to turn on the father's IGF2 promoter.</span><span>The </span><em>H19</em><span> gene encodes an RNA molecule with no open reading frame, but with tumour suppressor properties and maintaining maternal imprint of IGF2.<span>n a majority of Wilms' tumors (WTs) there is an abnormal bipaternal pattern of expression at three imprinted loci, H19 and IGF2. </span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine, an epigenetic modifier that reactivates genes otherwise suppressed by DNA promoter methylation, is effective for some cancers. It <span>inhibits the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) by forming covalent adducts with the enzyme, leading to its sequestration and cellular depletion. As a result of reduced DNMT activity during subsequent cell division DNA methylation is increasingly diminished. Consequently, cytosine methylation is reduced in newly replicated DNA, but not in the DNA of resting or non-dividing cells. In addition, Decitabine has been shown to induce depletion of DNMT1 through proteosomal degradation</span><span>. In cell line models, these nucleoside DNA methylation inhibitors proved to effect methylation and to re-activate epigenetically silenced tumour suppressor genes</span><span>. Importantly, Decitabine induced re-expression of genes known to mediate drug response, for example </span><em>MLH1,</em><span> resulting in enhanced chemosensitivity to cytotoxic drugs </span><span>.</span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy.<span>Unlike other forms of gene regulation (those involving transcription factors, for example), epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might therefore be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells.</span><span>It is generally believed that early life (germline- prenatal and somatic- postnatal and chenmical exposure) constitutes a period during which there is increased sensitivity to the regulatory effects of epigenetic mechanisms. During the sensitive period the re-programing of the methylation takes place hence to use drugs that change methylation states would hamper the natural re-programming process.</span></span></p></div>
