    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Igf2 is expressed from paternal allele.  Due to DNA methylation at ICR, the binding of an insulator protein CTCF on paternal allele is blocked.  The DNA methylation further spreads to H19 promoter, which results in silencing of H19.  Therefore, the enhancers can access Igf2, to enhance its expression.</p>
<p>In contrast, ICR is unmethylated on maternal allele.  The CTCF binding, which occurs on maternal allele, insulates Igf2 from the enhancers.  In this case, the enhancers can't access Igf2; instead, they access/ enhance H19 promoter, and Igf2 isn't expressed from the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Due to ICR hypermethylation in Wilm's disease, CTCF binding is blocked on both parental alleles.  The H19 is silenced and Igf2 is expressed on maternal allele, similar to paternal allele.  A biallelic (from both parental alleles) expression of Igf2 occurs that results in excessive expression of Igf2.  The overexpression of Igf2, which is an oncogene promoter, leads to excessive growth and therefore cancer.  Therefore, ICR hypermethylation and associated loss of imprinting, which are common and early features of cancer, lead to an overexpression of growth promoting gene in Wilm's disease. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA demethylating agent, or DNMT inhibitor (DNMTI), with an antineoplastic effect.  Through inhibiting enzymes responsible for DNA methylation, Decitabine restores expression of tumour suppressor genes, thus reducing cell division and slowing proliferation.  Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue that irreversibly binds DNMTs after they are incorporated into DNA; thus uses a replication dependent mechanism.  Decitabine is currenly used in myelodysplastic syndromes that ofren precede acute myelogenous leukaemia.  In combination with hystone deacetylase inhibitors, DNMTIs were shown to be also effective against solid tumors.  Concerns include lack of specificity and risks of affecting normal cells, especially considering mitoric heritability of epigenetic changes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are mitotically inherited, therefore, alterations of epigenetic marks that are brought by these drugs are thought to have a long-lasting impact.  The discussion in the article about Decitabine discussing that epigenetic changes are "mitotically heritable until they are actively erased, at which point they can't return", can also be considered in this context. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are the periods of epigenetic reprogramming, including early embrionic development and germ cell development periods.  During these periods, the processes of clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks occur, to ensure totipotency of cells.  The reprogramming of imprinted genes also happens in the germ cell development period.  Changes in setting or erasing epigenetic marks in these periods can have a long-term and significant impact, including transgenerational impact, in light of mitosis and differentiation of cells, and lack of specificity inherent to the mechanism of cancer drugs that can affect not only cancer cells but also normal cells.  Alterations of critical processes such as DNA methylation (irreversible binding of DNMT) that are essential for resetting epigenetic marks can affect normal cells and their viability in long run, cause widespread changes in chromatine structure, cause genome instability, imprinting disorders, irregulation between epigenetic processes, anomialies and other changes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>DNA methylation</strong> <strong>at CpG islands</strong> involves adding a methyl group to Cytosine at CpG dinucleotides. CpG islands are often found at gene promoters and usually unmethylated.  DNA methylation is a mitotically inherited inactive epigenetic mark that is associated with gene silencing when found at promoters. The gene silencing occurs through forming condensed chromatin structure, primarily through binding of methylated CpG binding proteins that either alter transcription themselves or by recruiting other agents.   </p>
<p>A locus specific DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands is a typical characteristic of cancer that serves to condense chromatin structures and silence tumor suppressor gene expressions.  It is "a hit", according to Khudson theory of multiple hits in cancer.  The identity of affected CpGs is unique for specific types and subtypes of cancer. </p>
<p>Based on the course materials, DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes.  Through silencing tumor suppressor genes, a locus specific DNA hypermethilation at CpG islands contributes to disease. </p>
<p>In contrast,<strong> DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements</strong> serves to maintain genome stability/integrity,through silencing cryptic transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites; silencing of repeats or mutation of MeC to T, to prevent transpositions; silencing repeats to prevent illegimate recombinations.or transcriptional interference from strong promoters. </p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethilation is a characteristic feature of cancer.  Hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repeats leads to genome instability caused by replications, deletions, insertions, translocations, transpositions of the repeats, illegitimate recombinations between repeats, that can further lead to activation of oncogenes, silencing of tumor suppressor genes, activation of cryptic promoters disruption to neighboring genes. and other changes that would allow division and growth of cancer cells.  The course materials referer to the evidence of increases in genome instability cause by hypomethylation in specific tissues in mice and DNMT3B mutations in humans.</p>
