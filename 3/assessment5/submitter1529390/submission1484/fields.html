    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally at CpG islands, DNA is not methylated. This hypomethylated DNA is less dense and more open which allows for easier gene expression . Where DNA is hypermethylated at CpG islands and CpG island shores it usually results in gene silencing or much reduced gene expression. As methylation marks are mitotically inherited this means the gene silencing will be maintained. When this occurs in tumour suppressor genes or genes controlling cell proliferation we have tumorigenesis and potential cancer development. Normally DNA would be methylated in intergenic regions and repeats. This methylated DNA is heterochromatinised and not available for recombination or transcription thereby conferring stability on the genome. Early on in tumorigenesis, DNA hypomethylation occurs genome wide. This reduced methylation results in a less dense, looser arrangement of the DNA and renders it susceptible to aberrant recombinations in repeats, deletions, insertions and other transcriptional errors. In intergenic regions and especially in repeats the hypomethylation progresses with tumour progression resulting in genome instability for example in ICF syndrome. </p>
<p>DNA methylation affects different tumours in different ways depending on whether they are tumour suppressor hypermethylation or genome wide hypomethylation driven. In the former DNA methylation depletion would result in cancer suppression, in the latter it would enhance cancer development. The stage of cancer, whether early or advanced, also changes the potential therapy game plan. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is an example of an insulator model of imprinting. The imprinted control region (ICR) is methylated on the paternal allele which blocks binding of CTFC insulator protein, allowing enhancers to access Igf2 gene for expression and spread of DNA methylation to the H19 promoter gene thus silencing it. In the maternal allele the ICR is bound to CTFC protein which insulates Igf2 gene from enhancers thus silencing it. The enhancers act on H19 promoter gene thereby expressing it. Imprinted genes are known to be involved in growth. Errors in imprinting can thus result in fetal and post natal overgrowth for example in Wilm's tumour where DNA hypermethylation at the ICR on both the paternal and the maternal alleles results in increased expression of Igf2 (growth factor) predisposing to early renal tumorigenic growth in children. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a cytoside analogue that gets taken up into the DNA during replication and then binds to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) irreversibly so that it cannot be released for further methylation. This mechanism only works in dividing cells. Since tumour cells are dividing more than normal cells, this means that more methyltransferases are put out of use in cancerous cells. This results in reduced availability of DNMT1 for methylation. In other words it is a DNA demethylation agent. Its action in tumour suppressor genes results in hypomethylation of the CpG islands on the promoter of the tumour suppressor gene. The result is less dense, less compacted chromatin which facilitates gene expression and suppression of the tumour. It is thought that Decitabine might affect all dividing cells but it is unclear whether this will result in long term effects.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Once epigenetic changes such as DNA demethylation are effected through epigenetic drug therapy, subsequent daughter cells will inherit those altered epigenetic marks. Over time the tumorigenic epigenetic marks will be removed and this may alter the response by those cells to traditional chemotherapy i.e. they may respond more favourably. Periods of epigenetic reprogramming (i.e. clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks) during<span> pre-implantation and primordial germ cell (PGC) development and genomic imprinting during gametogenesis are sensitive periods. Imprinted genes are essential for the viability of the fetus so epigenetic marks need to be stable and heritable to endure throughout development. Imprinting comes about through DNA methylation of imprint control regions (ICRs). DNA methylation must therefore be highly conserved during these times. An epigenetic drug that alters DNA methylation might result in errors in imprinting, resetting or reprogramming of the genome and should be avoided during sensitive periods.</span></p></div>
