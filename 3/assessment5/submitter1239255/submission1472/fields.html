    <div class="field-value"><p>addition of methyl group on the DNA-cytosine CPG - dinucleotides , as they are symmetrical, thus are maintained thrugh cell division CpG islands are mostly found at promoters for genes,  methylation at the CpG islands leads to the silencing of the gene allowing specific genes to be transcriptionally active and certain genes to be silent. The methylation marks on the CpG islnds increse with the increase in the size of tumors and its stage. In cancer the CpG island before the cancer supressor genes that are generally unmethylated thus resulting in expression of the suppressor genes, are methylated therefore causing the silencing of the tumor supressor genes, causing prolifertion. The methylation in the intergenic regions and repetitive regions on the DNA results in the bsence of transcription of such DNA , in case of cancer these regions are hypomethylated thus result in the activation of oncogenes.hypomethylation at the repeats causes illegitimate recombination between chromosomes.<br /><br /><br /></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent(DNMT inhibitor).</p>
<p>When there is an increase in DNA methylation, it results in the blockage of the activity of "suppressor genes" that regulate cell division and growth. When suppressor genes are blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, promoting cancer. Decitabine works by demethylating the supressor DNA or by preventing the methylation of them, thus the normal function of the supressor genes is restored and maintained.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, it gets incorporated into the DNA during strand synthesis and when DNMT binds to it for methylation, the DNMT gets irreversibly bound to it, thus preventing copying of the methylation marks. As cancer cells are rapidly multiplying, the rate of replication is very high thus they are majorly affected by Decitabine causing their death, thus preventing tumor growth. Some normal cells might be affected too, but the ratio of cancer cell deth is much higher. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased, they do not return nce erased . Epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells and passing the same onto future generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive period is the phase of development where the environment has a sizble effect on the epigenetic makeup. Usually the epigenome is being remodeled during this time where suitable methylation marks are being removed and new ones being established.The sensitive periods are :</p>
<p>Primordial germ cell development</p>
<p>Preimplantation and postimplantation periods.</p>
<p>Using drugs that modify/alter the DNA methylation during the sensitive periods of development would cause inaccurate or incomplete transfer or establishment of methylation marks onto the DNA or onto the newly synthesised ones thus radically changing the expression of the concerned genes in the DNA, which might give rise to a diseased state, causing even cell death or tumerogenesis, infertility or imprinting disorders. there is a possiblity of transfer of these altered methylation to the offsprings.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The maternal ICR is un-methylated, thus CTCF is free to bind to the ICR. The looping is blocked by the bound CTCF( an insulator protein, insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers) and thus secondary prefference is given to the H19 gene and the enhancers bind to H19 and result in formation of lncRNA.</p>
<p>The paternal ICR is methylated and thus CTCF cannot bind to the ICR, here the enhancers are able to loop and bind to the Igf2 and cause its expression, the H19 is silenced due to heterochromatin spreding(DNA methylation spreading)</p>
<p>in patients with Wilm's tumor, loss of heterozygosity of the maternal allele, biallelic expression of <em>IGF2</em> has been observed in association with loss of methylation at a DMR in <em>IGF2.</em></p>
<p>The ICR1 region has too many methyl groups attached (hypermethylation), this abnormality disrupts the regulation of both genes. Specifically, hypermethylation of the ICR1 region leads to a loss of <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene activity and increased activity of the <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene in many tissues. A loss of <span class="geneSymbol">H19</span> gene activity, which normally restrains growth, and an increase in <span class="geneSymbol">IGF2</span> gene activity, which promotes growth, together lead to overgrowth and an increased risk of tumors.</p></div>
