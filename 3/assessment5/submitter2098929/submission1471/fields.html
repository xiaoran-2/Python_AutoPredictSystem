    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer results when oncogenes are activated and also when tumor suppressors are inactivated. Expression of both the oncogenes and tumor suppresors are influenced by the epigenetic marks on the DNA. DNA methylation often occurs at CpG Islands, Intergenic Regions and Repetive elements. DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5' region of cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides to form a 5-methyl cytosine. CpGs are clustered into CpG Island which is often located at the promoter region of genes. Methylation of the CpG Island clusters, causes silencing of downstream gene.</p>
<p>In normal cells, CpG Island is usually unmethylated. In Cancer cells, increased hypermethylation is observed on CpG Islands. Since many tumour suppressor genes have CpG islands, Hypermethylation of these CpG Island results in the repressed expression of this tumor suppressors hereby increasing tumor formation or progression. CpG island promoters are found in several genes. Distruption of the methylation pattern of the methylation pattern of this island may result in diseased states. Several Neurological, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases has been linked to a distrupted methylation of the CpG island.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the intergenic regions and repetitive element that contains CpG dinucleotides are methylated. This methylation silences repeat hereby preventing transposition of DNA segment, it also prevent the potential of transposited repeat to interfere with the transcription of a normal gene. But in cancer cells, increased hypomethylation of the CpG dinucleotides are observed in the intergenic regions and repetitive element, and recent evidences has shown that absence of DNA methylation in the intergenic regions of DNA results in Genomic instabilities. In other disease condition, alteration of the methylation pattern of intergenic region and repetive element would either activate or deactivate other important genes. This distruption might result in a diseased state or a malfunction of cellular metabolism.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When the ICR on the maternal is not methylated, it is bound by CTCF. CTCF is an insulator protein, and it insulates the igf from the enhancers that are upstream. (essentially, the enhancers cannot get to the igf2 gene on the maternal allele). Because of this insulation, the downstream enhancers then bind to the H19 gene , hereby enhancing its expression.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele, when the ICR is methylated, the CTCF cannot bind, hence the downstream enhancer is able to enhance the expression of igf2. H19 on the paternal allele is silenced due to the methylation of its CpG island</p>
<p>When the ICR of some imprinted genes are hypermethylated, like in the case of igf2 gene cluster, as seen in Wilm's tumor, CTFC insulator protein is unable to bind, this then lead to the methylation of the H19 domain. Eventually, imprinting is lost and both alleles begins to express the igf2 genes. This leads to the overexpression of igf2, a growth factor, hereby leading to tumor formation</p>
<p>Since over 150 genes are imprinted genes, a dysfunction on any of these may result in either the underexpression or overexpression of genes in so doing may result in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belong to the class of DNA-demethylating agent. They are inhibitors that targets DNA methyltranferase, hereby preventing the addition of a methyl group to the 5' regions of a CpG dinucleotides. In cancer therapy, Decitabine act as a nucleoside analogue, hereby binding irrevesibly with DNMT and inhibiting their acctions.</p>
<p>When DNMT are inhibited, they are unable to methylate hemi methylated DNA sequences, so as the DNA replicates, one strand of the DNA will not be methylated.</p>
<p>Since tumor results from the overexpression of oncogenes and reduced expression of tumor suppressor, A DNMT inhibitor like Decitabine would act primarily by unmethylating the tumour supressor genes. When such genes are unmethylated, they would help in suppressing tumor formation. But since the effect of demethylation is systemic, there is skeptism on the potential impact. Though results from clinical trials have proved successful and less toxic than conventional chemotherapies against cancer</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have effects that last beyond the period of treatment if the drugs are administered to patients during the epigenetic “sensitive period”. Administration of such drug will bring about a permanent change in the epigenetics marks on the individual's DNA. Such modified epigenetics could then be transfered to future generations.</p>
<p>"Sensitive period" refers to the periods when the epigenetic marks are still being established. This period corresponds to periods when the gametes are being developed (Primodial Germ Cell formation), and during the early development of the foetus(early embryonic development). In males, the sensitive period is just before they enter puberty, at this stage, the sperm cells are being developed. In females, it corresponds to when the eggs are being developed and also when the foetus is growing in the mother.</p>
<p>Administration of drugs at period of active resetting of the epigenetic marks might lead to a modified epigenetics &amp; trangenerational transfer of the modified epigenetics. Since we dont know the detailed mechanisms of this drug agent, and also based on the fact that the drugs are systemic, it may result in the formation of new syndromes as is already reported for some cases ART.</p></div>
