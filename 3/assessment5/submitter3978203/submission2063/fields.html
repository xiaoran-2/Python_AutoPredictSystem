    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When talking about the DNA methylation on the CPG islands, we refer to some mechanism of gene silencing; these mechanism of silencing is much expressed in cancer. In the way that cancer is expressed when the gene for the specific condition is expressed.  Sometimes the hypermetilation of the CPG island in cancer can make the CPG to serve as elements for fighting cancer.  In other words they could serve tumor suppressor genes or simply codify for that type genes, by this controlling the over expression of unwanted cells that proliferate in an uncontrolled manner.  Another roll for the DNA methylation is when they act in the intergenic regions or repetitive regions with the porpoise of maintaining the integrity of the genome and by it protecting it from unwanted diseases.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is one of the latest discoveries in cancer treatment related to epigenetic. These drug is related or has a very similar mechanism to azacitidine, wich is a DNA methyltransferasa inhibitors, some researchers say that it acts by removing inhibitory methyl groups from the cytosine residues of promoter sequences, which presumably restores downstream gene transcription, it also can act as a tumor suppressor, cause them activated it will basically destroy most of cancer cells or malignant tissues.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Sometimes the DNA methylation can be altered and by that causing the restoring of the downstream transcription.  This effect could make the genome one more stable and stronger, with these new characteristics’ the genome could be transmitted from one generation to the other and by it giving growth to more stronger progeny.  In the process of the cellular changes or growth id where the organism id more susceptible to diseases and also could be more sensitive to new way of treatments</p></div>
