    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, CPG islands are left unmethylated (hypomethylated). As CPG islands are located in about 60% of promoters, this state enables the regulation of gene expression as an inverse or reverse key approach.  That is the lack of methylation at CPG islands at a promoter results in a gene being expressed. </p>
<p>Cancer cells have been found to contain hyper methylation of CPG islands. In fact it has been found that in general,  the amount of methylation at CPG islands increases over time as the cancer develops to metastasis.</p>
<p>The mechanism through which this occurs is varied depending on the tumour type. However it will generally involve the methylation of tumour suppressor genes. As methylation is mitotically inheritable, this results in generations of cells without tumour suppression and thus enabling the rapid growth of the tumour. An example of this is the BRCA1 gene which has been found in a large proportion of breast cancers.</p>
<p>Normal cells will have hyper methylated intergenic regions and across repetitive elements. This allows the cell to control genomic stability by minimising the chances of translocations of the chromatin. This is achieved by ensuring, in particular repetitive elements remain hypo methylated and subsequently tightly bound.</p>
<p>In the case of cancer, repetitive elements become hyper methylated. As a result the chromatin becomes open and subsequently increases the likelihood of chromosome translocations. This causes illegitimate recombination between repeats and the activation of cryptic promoters and the disruption of neighbouring genes. An example of this instability is the hypo methylation in mice due to the deletion of Dnmt1 (responsible for maintaining methylation), which results in embryo death and cancer in adults.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>An example of genomic imprinting is the H19/Igf2 cluster. Genomic imprinting is characterised by the monoallelic expression of a gene, based on the parent of origin of that allele. This comes about as the imprinted genes resist de methylation during early development.</p>
<p>The expression of imprinted genes is controlled by imprint control regions (ICRs). The control of ICRs is governed by DNA methylation. So if maternally imprinted then paternal ICR is methylated.</p>
<p>In the case of the maternal allele, being unmethylated results in the addition of CTCF binding to the ICR. This binding insulates Igf2 expression resulting in enhancers working on the H19 site to produce H19.</p>
<p>For the paternal allele In the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated. This results in the blocking of CTCF binding as well as the methylation spreading down to the H19 cluster (heterochromatin spreading). As a result the enhancers act upon Igf2 resulting in its expression.</p>
<p>Wilm’s tumor of the kidney, comes about from the effective multiple expression of the paternal allele for Igf2. Igf2 is an oncogene of growth promoter. The effective double expression of this gene promotes rapid growth. It comes about by mutations which can cause the loss of imprinting, via uni parental disomy or having two paternal copies being inherited or epigenetic disruption.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNMT inhibitor. DNMT are enzymes that maintain methylation in the chromatin. Decitabine is used for Myelodyspastic syndrome that has progressed to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue. It is easily incorporated into a cell. Decitabine action is dependant on replication of the cell. Once incorporated the Decitabine binds to DNMT and does not release. Rendering the DNMT it binds to as non-functional, this in turn reduces DNA demethylation.</p>
<p>Because the action is dependent on cell replication and we know cancer cells are generally replicated at a faster rate than healthy cells, Decitabine has a greater effect on cancer cells than healthy cells though the impact on healthy cells is still not known. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hypermethylation has been found to be a common biomarker across nearly all cancers. This is particularly the case across CPG islands. With cancer it has been found that tumor suppressor hyper methylation is even more common than actual mutations.</p>
<p>As DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, once it has occurred it is quickly developed. Depending on the mutation that takes place the cell may in fact become the dominant cell type as a result of the epigenetic change. In other words they may develop a competitive advantage. If a drug is able to alter DNA methylation in a positive way, it is possible for a cancer to be stopped or slowed and for healthy cells to proliferate due to the mitotic heritability of the positive change to the cells DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The sensitive period for development, is when epigenetic marks are being laid down. An example of this sensitive period is the pre implantation period of early development as well as during primordial germ cell development. Any epigenetic change during this period can have wide ranging consequences as it only takes a change to a single cell to impact a large number of cells over a short period of time. </p></div>
