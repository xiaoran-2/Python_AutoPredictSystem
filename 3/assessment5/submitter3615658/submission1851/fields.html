    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark that ensures tissue- and cell-specific gene expression pattern. DNA is methylated on cytosine residues (in Cytosin-Guanin dinucleotides, CpGs) by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Clusters of CpGs, called CpG islands, are frequently found in the promoter region of genes. These are usually unmethylated. Generally DNA methylation inversely correlates with gene expression. However, CpG islands are usually unmethylated independently of their activity.</li>
<li>In cancer, CpG islands or shores of CpG islands often become hyper-methylated, which causes silencing of the respective genes. In colorectal cancer tumours that belong to the “CpG island methylator phenotype” (CIMP) are characterised by methylation of several gene promoters. Which tumour suppressors become silenced by hyper-methylation is tumour-dependent. Methylation is increasing with tumour progression, but also with age.</li>
<li>Cancer is characterised by improper activation of (several) oncogenes and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressors are often involved in DNA repair (e.g. MSH, MLH, BRCA) control of cell proliferation (APC, RB, p16) or apoptosis (p21). Usually both alleles need to be inactive. While the inactivation of the first allele (first hit) is often caused by mutations, the second hit can be often silencing through hyper-methylation of the promoter.</li>
<li>Repetitive elements and intergenic regions are usually methylated, thus silenced. Silencing repetitive elements and intergenic regions maintains genomic integrity, inhibits transposition and prevents activation of cryptic promoters.</li>
<li>One hallmark of cancer is global DNA hypo-methylation and CpG island hyper-methylation. The hypo-methylated regions are mainly the repetitive elements and intergenic regions. Hypo-methylation can be caused by inactivation of DNMT1, by deamination of <sup>me</sup>C by AID, followed by base excision repair, or oxidation to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine. Some of the hypo-methylated regions coincide with late replication foci and regions associated with nuclear lamina.</li>
<li> Hypo-methylation of repetitive elements may trigger genomic instability and inadequate initiation of transcription. Activation of intergenic regions might lead to gene disruption, transpositions or illegitimate recombinations.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The H19/Igf2 cluster is on chromosome 11 and is paternally imprinted. The ICR is methylated on the paternal allele. This methylation had spread to the promoter of H19 (a long noncoding RNA) which becomes also silenced. Enhancers located downstream of H19 can bind to Igf2, which is upstream to the ICR. The mechanism is called chromosome looping.</li>
<li>On the maternal allele, the ICR is not methylated. CTCF, an insulator protein binds to this region. Thus the enhancers are not anymore able to reach Igf2, which becomes silenced. H19 is expressed. The enhancers would preferably loop to Igf2, but this looping is inhibited by the insulator CTCF binding to the ICR.</li>
<li>In Wilm’s tumour both alleles behave like the paternal allele: either the ICR becomes methylated also on the maternal allele, or there is a uniparental (in this case paternal) disomy: the person/cell has two copies of the paternal chromosome 11.</li>
<li>Disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster would cause upregulation of Igf2, a growth factor, which gives growth advantage to the tumour cell.</li>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Decitabine, or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a cytidine anlaogue, is a DNMT inhibitor.  It is considered a DNA demethylating agent. However it is not an active demethylating agent, it is an inhibitor of methylation (of the newly synthesized DNA strand).</li>
<li>Decitabine will be incorporated into the DNA instead of cytidine. There binds irreversibly the DNA methytransferase 1 (DNMT1), the key maintenance methyltransferase, inhibiting methylation of the newly synthesized DNA strand. Methylation will be reduced with every cell division.</li>
<li>In cancer, promoters of tumour suppressor genes are often hyper-methylated, causing loss of gene expression. Decitabine would inhibit the methylation of these promoters in the dividing tumour cells, enabling the re-expression of these tumour suppressors.</li>
</ol></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>DNA methylation is a feature that is passed on during cell division to the daughter cells; it is mitotically inherited. Treatment with drugs that inhibit methylation will inhibit methylation of the newly synthesized DNA. After several cell division cycles the DNA methylation will be erased and will not re-occur. Inhibition of DNMT3 would inhibit de novo methylation (e.g. during gametogenesis).</li>
<li>Sensitive periods are those where the methylation marks are erased and epigenetic reprogramming occurs or when the environment has the strongest influence.</li>
<li>Sensitive periods are:<ol><li>Immediately after fertilization and early embryonic development when the first epigenetic reprogramming occurs.</li>
<li> Development of the primordial germ cells.</li>
<li>There seems to be another key period until the second birthday of the children (Barker hypothesis).</li>
<li>The Slow Growth Period, the time before puberty (9-12 years for boys and 8-10 years for girls).</li>
<li>Maturation period of germ cells.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>These drugs, at least now, are lacking specificity. The mechanism of action is not precisely known. Treating patients during sensitive periods (during epigenetic reprogramming or maturation of germ cells) would influence imprinting or affect development of future generations as well in an un-controllable way.</p></div>
