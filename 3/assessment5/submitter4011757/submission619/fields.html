    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation at CpG islands is associated with the silencing of gene expression. CpG islands are usually located at the promoters of genes. Individual CpG dinucleotides within the genome are generally methylated. CpG island methylation is important for the regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>CpG islands are disrupted in cancer. In cancer cells, CpG islands located before tumor suppressor gene promoters are usually hypermethylated. CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions is  often decreased. Hypermethylation of gene promoters may result in gene silencing. If genes involved in the cell cycle are silenced, this may result in tumorigenesis. The DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumor suppressor genes and at ICR's can result in a loss of imprinting. Tumor suppressor hypermethylation is generally more frequent than mutations.</p>
<p>The normal function of DNA methlation of intergenic regions and repetitive elements is thought to be to maintain genomic integrity. Without appropriate methylation at intergenic regions, an abnormal karyotype could result, including deletions, reciprocal translocations and insertions. Silencing of transcription start sites or cryptic splice sites is also thought to play a role. DNA methylation at repetitive elements results in silencing repeats to prevent transposition, by mutation of the repeats to prevent transposition, by silencing of repeats to avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters and by preventing illegitimate recombination because the DNA is tightly packed.</p>
<p>Early in cancer, there is a genome-wide hypomethylation. There is hypomethylation at intergenic regions, repeats and there is genomic instability. DNA hypomethylation at these locations can contribute to oncogenesis by causing chromasomal instability and reactivation of tansposable elements and latent oncogenes. Hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause a loss of imprinting. </p>
<p>Disruption of a tumor suppressor gene requires the complete loss of function of both copies of the involved gene.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p> The Igf2 cluster on human chromasome 11 is controlled by enhancer blocking. The Igf2 gene encodes insulin-like growth factor II.</p>
<p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster , the paternal allele is methylated at the ICR which blocks blinding of CTCF. Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it and enhancers can now access Igf2 to activate it. The paternal allele is silenced when methylated.</p>
<p>At the H19/Igf2 cluster, the maternal allele is unmethylated and bound by the insulator protein CTCF which insulates Igf2 from downstream enhancers. The enhancers are now free to express H19 on the maternal allele.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumor results when there is hypermethylation of ICR which results in a an overexpression of Igf2. The loss of imprinting results in both copies of the maternal and paternal alleles being methylated so there is a double dose of Igf2.</p>
<p>Alterations of DNA methylation at ICR's can result in the loss of expression of growth restricting genes  and overexpression of growth promoting genes as seen in Wilm' tumor. In Wilm's tumor the maternal chromasome reverses to a paternal epigenotype resulting in increased cell growth.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA approved drug that works as a hypomethylating agent. Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT). DNMT inhibitors are a nucleoside analogue.</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors work by irreversibly binding to DNMT after they are incorporated into DNA. They are replication dependent. Rapidly dividing cells are most affected by this drug.</p>
<p>Decitabine has an anti-tumor effect by its hypomethylating action. This drug is incorporated into DNA when DNMT comes to bind it to copy methylation to the daughter strand, DNMTi is bound irreversibly and cannot be released. The full mechanism of action of Decitabine is not fully understood, but hematological cancers may be dependent on tumor suppressor gene hypermethylation. It is thought that myelodysplastic malignancies may be dependent on CpG island hypermethylation.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dr. Baylin discussed that epigenitic changes are passed on by cell division to daughter and grandaughter cells until they are actively erased. This may be how epigenetic drugs can have an epigenetic effect to inhibit tumor growth without having to kill all of the cells. </p>
<p>Tumorogenic cells often have an inverted CpG methylation profile. In cancer cells, CpG islands preceding tumor suppressor gene promoters are often hypermethylated and CpG methylation of oncogene promoter regions and parasitic repeat sequences is often hypomethylated. Hypermethylation of gene promoters can result in gene silencing. If genes involving the cell cycle are silenced, cells may grow in an uncontrolled fashion leading to malignancies. (Wikipedia-Cancer Epigenetics)</p>
<p>A sensitive period of development  is a period when an altered environment may have a lasting effect on epigenetic control.</p>
<p>The two most senstive periods of development in mammals is from pre-implantation to early post-implanation and from the development of primordial germ cells to gametes.</p>
<p>Treating cancers during sensitive periods could permanently alter the epigenetics of an individual to favor tumor development. There is epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells and in early development to clear epigenetic marks.  </p></div>
