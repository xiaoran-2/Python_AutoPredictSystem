    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

    <div class="field-value"><p>Gene promoter CpG islands tend to be protected from DNA methylation but methylation can be found in CpG islands, which then results in specific gene expression silencing. Concretely, in cancer there is a hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumor suppressor promoters, leading to silencing of tumor suppressor genes like anti-apoptotic genes or growth suppressor genes. Silencing of those genes is beneficial to cancer cells, so they are rapidly selected and changes are passed mitotically to daughter cancer cells, promoting cancer development.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is essential for maintaining genomic integrity in intergenic regions and in repetitive elements, but also contributes to silencing of cryptic promoters or cryptic splice sites that would interfere with normal transcription. Regarding genomic integrity, the function of DNA methylation is to silence the promoters of genes needed for transposition of repetitive elements. In cancer, the loss of methylation in these regions brings to illegitimate recombination and transposition that result in deletions, insertions or translocations: that is, in genomic instability. This causes disruption of genes that may participate as tumor suppressor genes, and also the activation of neighboring genes that may act as oncogenes, leading to promotion of cancer.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation can be achieved by alteration of the epigenetic machinery such as DNA methyltransferases either by increasing their activity or by decreasing it.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19/Igf2 cluster is known as a paternaly imprinted cluster because DNA methylation takes place in the paternal chromosome. In contrast, the maternal imprint control region (ICR) is unmethylated. Concretely, determination of this imprinting is accomplished by the insulator protein CTCF, which can bind to the unmethylated ICR but not to the methylated ICR. On the one hand, in the unmethylated maternal chromosome, CTCF blocks the association of the Igf2 gene with some downstream enhancers, not allowing Igf2 expression, and therefore allows such association between the H19 gene with those enhancers, allowing H19 expression. On the other hand, CTCF cannot bind to the methylated paternal ICR, resulting in the activation of the Igf2 gene and silencing of the H19 gene by spreading of the ICR methylation in the paternal chromosome.</p>
<p>Abnormal methylation in the maternal ICR of the H19/Igf2 cluster leads to an abnormal behavior of the maternal chromosome as a paternal chromosome, which results in an overexpression of the Igf2 gene and silencing of the H19 gene. This methylation of the maternal ICR contributes to Wilm’s tumor because there is an increase of Igf2 expression, which is actually a growth promoting gene: an oncogene.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is found in a class of drugs called hypomethylation agents and is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor. In particular, Decitabine is an azanucleoside that turns into azacytosine after a chain of cell metabolic reactions, which is then incorporated into DNA as a cytosine. Azacytosine-guanine dinucleotides are recognized by DNA methyltransferases as CpGs and, after theri binding, Azacytosine blocks DNA methyltransferases function to consecutively trigger degradation of such enzymes, resulting in a decrease of methylation in the DNA.</p>
<p>Therefore, Decitabine and similar drugs like Azacytidine can be used to treat hypermethylation tumors such as myelodysplastic syndromes by impeding the incorporation of methyl groups onto the DNA and, for instance, allowing reactivation of tumor suppressor genes after subsequent replications.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is mitotically heritable, therefore it can last through the daughter cells of the cell whose DNA methylation was altered. This inheritance can be accomplished just after replication by recognition of hemi-methylated strands of DNA by DNA methyltransferase I, which then lays down methylation on the daughter strand. However, mitotically inheritance doesn’t last forever because reprogramming of the epigenome takes place at least twice during mammalian development in the so-called sensitive periods: the early development period and the primordial germ cell development period.</p>
<p>These two stages of development are called sensitive periods because the epigenome is susceptible to undergo changes due to the environment. For instance, treating patients during sensitive periods may have inappropriate outcomes for their offspring because germ cells can be non-deliberately epigenetically modified during their development.</p></div>
