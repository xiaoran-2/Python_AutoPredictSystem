<ul><li>FROM CLASS NOTES</li>
</ul><p>CpGIslandsare clusters of unmythelated CpGs in the regulatory part of the gene. Mythelation changes gene expression by coating the CpG dinucleotide with methyltranserase enzyme.</p>
<p>Describe how DNA methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer. This normal process of gene silencing is accomplished through histone modification and mythelation. When this process is disrupted the is a hypermethylation of the CpG islands which turns off the tumor suppression and allows cancer tumors to develop.</p>
<p>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease. If the methylated cytosine in the DNA stops the binding of transcription factors it can cause genetic diseases like mental retardation and immune dysfunctions. The brain has to have DNA methylation to grow properly.</p>
<p>Describe the normal function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.</p>
<p>The intergenic region, about 80% of the genome, contains promoters that can change the surrounding regions and supports downstream replication and appropriate DNA methylation. Normally in cells the CpG islands are hypomethylated.  “But you find that the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements through the intergenic regions and indeed, even in the introns of genes.” </p>
<p>Describe how DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.</p>
<p>The genome, the repetitive elements, and these intergenic elements are usually hypomethylated in healthy cells. However, the process switches where the DNA methylation happens. These areas become hypermythelated and the tumor suppression gene is silenced and the potential for cancer develops as the cells reproduce and expand in specific tissues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Explain how disruption of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to disease.</p>
<p>In somatic cells the disruption described above causes disease that is tissue dependant for the type of disease that develops.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>KCNQ1 imprint control cluster is unmethylated, as it is in the paternal allele Result in expression of this long noncoding RNA. Most of the genes imprinted are then silenced.</p>
<p> Kcnq1 imprint control region is methylated as it is in the maternal chromosome, then this results in silencing of that Kcnq1 Ot1 methylation of the imprint control region, restricting the growth of a cell and inhibiting the growth.</p>
<p>The imprint control region is unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele, and this means it's paternally imprinted, the DNA methylation imprint is on the paternal chromosome. There is a long noncoding RNA being produced and then the area of the maternal allele is called H19 is being produced.</p>
<p>On the paternal allele when this imprint control region is methlyated CTCF can no longer bind. And there is no insulator action these enhancers act on Igf2. Igf2 is expressed only from the paternal allele. This creates the imprinted expression of Igf2. H19 is now no longer active on the paternal allele is DNA methylation spreading and at the imprint control region can spread downstream into the H19 promoter; it is silenced because it's a CPG island promoter.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.  This drug is a cytidine analog</li>
<li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation. The drug causes hypomethylation by blocking DNA methylization.</li>
<li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.  The drug would support a return the the hypomethylated state unblocking the silencing of the tumor suppression. This would allow appropriate function and theoretically an interference with the repetitive process in cell reproduction for the disruption of the disease process. This would allow for tumor decrease and support other forms of chemotherapy functioning.</li>
</ul><p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ul><li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome. </li>
<li> </li>
<li>The changes in the cell structures are passed through the daughter cells. When the process is returned to the normal healthy state the replication process is returned to the normal process and that supports the functioning of the traditional chemotherapy.</li>
<li> </li>
<li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period. In the replication process a sensitive period is one where the environment can have a negative impact on epigenetic development and transgenerational inheritance.</li>
<li>Identify sensitive periods of development. There are two, the first is in the individuals own reproductive system when an intervention could negatively impact the cell structures within ova. The second is by creating adverse impacts on the development of primordial germ cells.</li>
<li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. The impact can be within the current existing reproductive cells and the changes in primordial germ cells would negatively impact future generations reproductive capability.</li>
