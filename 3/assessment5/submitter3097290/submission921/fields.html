    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal (healthy) cells CpG islands are unmethylated because the nearby promoters should lead to expression of the downstream gene sequence. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. In cancer DNA methylation is completely reversed, CpG islands are heavily (hyper-) methylated, while intergenic regions and repetitive elements are not (hypo-) methylated. This leads to genomic instability. In cancer CpG islands and CpG island shores of tumour suppressor genes are silenced ICRs lost their epigenetic imprinting. Thus the tumour supressor genes cannot do their job in controlling cell growth, which leads to diseases.</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements leads to tightly packed chromatin (heterochromatin), where the DNA is less acessible to the transcribtional machinery (e.g. RNA polmerase, transcrption factors).</p>
<p>In cancer there is a genome-wide hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of repeats/intergenic intervals leads to genomic instability through illegitimate recombinations between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activating of cryptic promoters and disruption of neighbouring genes. Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in activation of genes e.g. R-RAS in gastric cancer, where miRNA(miR21) targeting tumour supressor PTEN is activated. Thus the contribution of DNA methylation to cancer is genome-wide hypomethylation and tumour suppressor hypermethylation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Paternal and maternal alleles carry the epigenome of parents. During sensitive periods in embryogenesis and gametogenesis epigenitical marks are erased. In this periods external effects like nutrition, famine,  metabolic disorders etc. can led to subtle changes in DNA methylation, which are inherited and consequently can have enduring effects on the epigenome. Treating patients during sensitive periods with epigenetic drugs would mean that demethylation and methylation might superimpose and cause undesired epigenomic states.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the imprint control region (ICR) is hypermethylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. lgf2 is upstream of the ICR and the H19 promoter downstream follwed by enhancers.On the maternal allele ICR interacts with the CTCF protein, which insulates the lgf2 growth factor from the downstream enhancers. On the paternal allele ICR hypermethylation blocks binding of CTCF. Without CTCF DNA methylation spreadfs to H19 promoter to silence and enhancers can access lgf2 to activate. If there is hypermethylation on the maternal allele as well, lgf2 is expressed too.So we have a double dose of lgf2 and the lgf2/H19 clusters both on the paternal and maternal allele cause Wilm's tumour. Thus the tumour is caused by an imprinted disorder on the maternal allele.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class of DNA methylation transferase inhibitors (DNMTi)s. It induces hypomethylation in neoplastic cells and may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation. In rapidly dividing cells the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent aducts between DNA-methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine.</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine (another demethylation agent) slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. This result was notable for two reasons. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed succesfully against a solid tumour (solid tumours are harder to treat because the drug has to penetrate them). And second some of the participants showing not much response to trial showed unexpectedly good reaction to subsequent chemotherapeutics.</p></div>
