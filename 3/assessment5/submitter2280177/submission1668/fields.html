    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal

    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal functioning cell the CpG islands are hypomethylated, but the genome in general is methylated in the repetitive elements, the intergenic regions and in the intrones of the genes. On the other hand in a cancer cell the CpG islands are more likely to be methylated and the rest of the genome is hypomethylated.</p>
<p>In cancer cells the DNA methylation of the CpG islands leads to <strong>silencing of tumour-suppressor genes</strong>. The cells that have this epimutation are more likely to <strong>divide quicker</strong> and to <strong>die less</strong>. CpG methylation <strong>progresses with time</strong> and <strong>differs by tumour type</strong>. Also changes in the DNA methylation in Imprint Control Regions can cause loss of expression of growth restricting genes or overexpression of growth promoting genes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells in <strong>all tumour types</strong> the intergenic intervals, the repetitive elements and the intrones are hypomethylated. That happens <strong>early in tumourgenesis</strong>. DNA methylation is maintaining genomic stabilyty in the normal cells and the lack of methylation in the cancer cells is the reason for the occurence of more karyotype abnormalities like - deletions, translocations and insertions, which means that the <strong>genome is unstable</strong>. For example recombination in the repeats of a normal cell will not happen because they are heavily methylated and they are densely packaged in heterochromatin. Wheares in a cancer cell the hypomethylation gives the repeats the possibility to make copies of themselves and get transposed. If they jump though out the genome they may cause <strong>activation of</strong> neighbouring genes and <strong>disruption of genes</strong>. In cancer cells there is also hypomethylation of the CpG poor promoters which is associated with an <strong>activation</strong> of the associated genes. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell the Imprint control region of the <span>H19/Igf2 cluster is <strong>methylated in the paternal</strong> and <strong>unmethylated in the maternal allele</strong>, therefore it is <strong>paternally imprinted</strong>. The long non-coding RNA H19 is produced only from the maternal allele, because when the ICR is unmethylated it is linked with a <strong>CTCF protein</strong>. This protein <strong>insulates</strong> the Igf2 from the subsequent enchancers. This way the enchancers are able to interact with the H19 and to enchance its expression.When the ICR is methylated the enchancers bind to the Igf2 which is the more prefered loop of the DNA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">In cancer cells occure changes in the DNA methylation in ICRS which lead to <strong>loss of imprinting</strong> - genes no longer express this impriting which is resulting in expression of both parental alleles or in their silencing. These changes can be both hypo- and hypermethylation depending on the role of the gene. In the case of  </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><strong>Wilm's tumour</strong> both alleles are <strong>hypermethylated</strong>. That results in extraproduction of the </span><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:21px;">Igf2 as the enchancers would prefer to  bind with it and not to the H19. Igf2 is a <strong>growth promoting factor</strong> and this example shows how in cancer these factors are more likely to be overexpressed in order to make the cell grow faster.</span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a demethylating agent which is a drug that <strong>inhibits DNA methylation</strong>.If the methylation is not inhibited then the chromatine will be more densely packaged.  If we consider that this methylation happens in a tumour-suppressor genes that would mean that by methylating these genes the expression of the tumour suppressors would be silenced. The anti-tumour effect of the Decitabine comes from its ability to prevent this DNA methylation, therefore it can <strong>prevent the silencing</strong> of the expression of the tumour suppressor which on the other hand would protect the cell from becoming a cancer cell. <br />The Decitabine is a <strong>nucleotide analogue</strong> that binds to DNMTs after they are incorporated in the DNA. It is <strong>replication dependant</strong> and the mechanism of the reaction of this class of drugs is still <strong>unclear</strong>.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In his reaserch Dr Baylin used <span>azacitidine which is  a drug that is a <strong>demethylating agent</strong>. This drug inhibits the methylation of the DNA, therefore it makes the DNA molecule not so densely packaged. This can have effect on the future treatment with <span>chemotherapeutic drugs because the DNA will be less packaged which means that it will be <strong>more accesible to these drugs</strong>. The long lasting effect of the treatment in the individual is due to the fact that DNA methylation is <strong>mitoticaly heritable</strong> and can be passed to the next cell generations. <br /></span></span></p>
<p>The sensitive period is a period of <strong>epigenetic reprograming</strong> when is happening the <strong>clearing and the resetting of epigenetic marks</strong>. This clearing of the epigenetic marks is happening in the <strong>development of the germ cells</strong> and also in early <strong>embryonic development</strong> (including the stages of preimplantation and early postimplantation). The sensitive period is <strong>susceptible to the changes</strong> in the environment.</p>
<p>Any changes in enviroment during this period have an effect on epigenetic control, which can result in <strong>change in the epigenetic outcome</strong>. Treatment of patients during sensitive periods is not advised because it will change the epigenetic marks and might have effect in future generations (if the treated patient is young and is still forming germ cells).</p></div>
