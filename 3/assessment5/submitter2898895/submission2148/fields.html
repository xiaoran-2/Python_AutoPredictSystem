DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>According to Hassler and Egger (2012) CpG islands are commonly found associated to gene promoter sequences. DNA methylation is usually absent in this sequences in normal cells whether these genes are actively transcribed or silent. This observation agrees with the fact that DNA methylation of promoter sequences usually correlates with silencing of transcription.</p>
<p>This authors explain that it has been observed in cancer cells that there is a tendency for promoter CpG island to become hypermethylated which then leads to silencing of transcription from those genes.</p>
<p>In a series of lectures, Blewitt (2013) has explained that usually those genes code for tumor supressing factors, which would normally stop excessive cell proliferation by means of controlling the cell cycle, activating apoptosis, or controlling DNS repair mechanisms (Hassler and Egger, 2012).</p>
<p>The Human genome includes regions which code for repetitive elements such as satellite repeats and even many remnants of retroviral genome inserted into chromosomes (Hassler and Egger, 2012). DNA methylation within this genes is usually associated with actively transcribed genes and while it is not absolutely established, it has been postulated that serves the purpose of repressing transcription from alternative start sites as well as inhibiting anti-sense transcription (Hassler and Egger, 2012). It has also been explained by these authors that it may inhibit direct RNA splicing and would relate with replication timing.</p>
<p>Sigalotti et al (2011) explain that in cancer cells it has been observed that cancer development and progression is characterised by overall genomic hypomethylation, mainly of repetitive elements.</p>
<p>Hypomethylation interferes with basic epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, heterochromatin formation and X chromosome inactivation (Hassler and Egger, 2012). Given the importance of these processes is not surprising increased hypomethylation of certain repetitive elements has been related to poorer prognosis in colon and ovarian cancers (Sigalotti et al., 2011).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an FDA-approved deoxyribonucleoside drug belonging to the DNA-demethylating agents class(Hollenbach et al., 2010). Its method of action is by inhibiting the DNA methyl Transferase enzime in the cell nucleus. This drugs has been used to treat patients presenting Myelodysplastic Syndromes.</p>
<p>Hollenbach et al., (2010) explain that Decitabine is believed to have a “dual mechanism” to affect cancer cells by means of inhibiting cell proliferation at high doses and also a DNA hypomethylation-mediated effect on gene re-expression at low doses. The latter would interfere with processes of cell differentiation and tumor suppression as well as stimulating immune mechanisms.</p></div>
