    <div class="field-value"><p>I hope this is a bit understandable, English is not my native language.</p>
<p>In normal/wildtype situations CpG islands are usually unmethylated. The function of CpG island near the promotor of genes are to silence the expression of the gene, this happens because its harder for transcription factors to bind to methylated DNA which leads to a lower amount of transcription of that specific gene. In cancer hypermethylation of CpG island can occur. This means that CpG island that are usually not methylated are now becoming methylated. An example of methylation of CpG islands contributing to the disease is the hypermethylation of CpG island near tumor suppressor genes, because these genes are expressed less now, the cell has less abillity to suppress tumor growth. Hypermethylation of sets of genes also happens often in cancer. This is called CpG Island methylator phenotype (CIMP).</p>
<p>DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements provides genomic stability. It prevents for example transpositions of repetitive elements (so a transposon for example wont end up being transposed into an active gene or lead to unwanted recombinations) and overall prevents insertions, deletions and reciprocal translocations. In cancer there can be genome wide hypomethylation of repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and GcP poor promotors (and ICRs). This hypomethylation means there is less methylation than in a normal situation. This can lead to the previously explained genomic instability, repeats and transposons could be activated, the recombination of repeats could lead to an abnormal karyotype. Unmethylated GcP poor promotors could lead to the over-expression oncogenes making it even worse. These effects are usually location specific.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The ICR on the paternal allele is methylated (H19 is methylated too in this state) which leads the enhancers to help the expression of lgf2 on the paternal allele.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated which leads to the binding of the CTCF insulator, the insulator insulates the Igf2 gene from downstream enhancers. This leads to the silencing of Igf2, meanwhile these enhancers do help with the expression of H19.</p>
<p>With Wilm's tumor both paternal and maternal allele are methylated. Now both the paternal and maternal allele express Igf2 which leads to a double dose of Igf2. Because Igf2 is growth promoting it contributes to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the class DNA methyl transferase inhibitors (DNMTi).</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analog, on replication they get incorporated into the DNA, when the DNA methyl transferase (DNMT1) binds to it to copy it to the daughter strand it is bound irriversibly. Its stuck and can not be removed anymore which leads to the daughter strands staying demethylated. Because this process is linked to the replication of cells (its incorporated into the DNA), cancerous cells are more affected than less quickly dividing normal cells. The use of a specific not too high dose of Decitabine causes tumor cells that depend on (hyper)methylated DNA regions to become demethylated. This leads to the death of these tumor cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altered DNA methylation is mitotically heritable (it gets maintained every cell division). So if changes to DNA methylation were made, these changes would be sustained for a life time.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of epigenetic reprogramming. In this period epigenetic marks like DNA methylation get cleared and rebuild in a specific way, depending on the role the specific cells have. The two main periods this happens are the period of early development of the embryo and at the primordial germ cell developement. The paternal and maternal genome get reprogrammed at both of these periods, and imprinted genes are mainly reset near the primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>Treatment during sensitive periods could lead to the reprogramming going wrong leading to unwanted long lasting side effects for the patients or the patient its offspring, depending on which sensitive period the patient got treated.</p></div>
