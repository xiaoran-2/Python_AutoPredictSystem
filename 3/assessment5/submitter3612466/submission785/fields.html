    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells the CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, and the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns are generally hypermethylated. In cancer it's the other way around. The CpG islands are likely to be hypermethylated, and the repetitive elements, intergenic regions and introns hypomethylated. </p>
<p>One way this can contribute to disease is by hypermethylating the tumor suppressor genes at the promotorregions of the genes, so the cells start to function abnormally.Transcriptional activity, DNA repair mechanisms and defence against carcinogenes may be inactivated. THe methylation of CpG islands tends to increase over time as the cancer progresses.</p>
<p>The global hypomethylation of the genome has influence on the stability of chromosomes, and can result in loss of imprinting and reactivation of for example retroviruses. All these factors can contribute to developpment of the tumour. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele the ICR is methylated, and cannot be bound bij CTCF. Therefore the enhancers can promote Igf2 expression. The methylation on the paternal allele can spread to the H19 promotor and silence it.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele the ICR is unmethylated, and is bound by the CTCF protein which insulates Igf2 by restricting enhancer acces to Igf2. These enhancers act on H19 increasing expression of the H19 allele.</p>
<p>In Wilms tumour the imprinting in the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted. There is loss of imprinting and overexpression of Igf2, which is a growth promoter,also of oncogenes, resulting in the appearance of 2 paternal like alleles, so biallelic expression of Igh2 is found, resulting in a tumor. Also there is a loss of tumor suppressing genes.</p>
<p>This alteration in methylation, resulting in loss of imprinting, especially of tumor surpressing genes and overexpression of growth promoting genes is what is often seen in cancers. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, a DNA demethylating agent, a DNMT inhibitor.</p>
<p>It hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylayion of DNA and cellular differentiation.</p>
<p>It can irreversibly bind DNMT after being incorporated in the DNA, and is division dependant. Therefore cancer cells are affected, because they repicate more than normal cells.</p>
<p>It reduces the proliferation of tumor cells, and lowers histone overmethylation, which is silencing the surrounding genes, including the tumor surpressor genes.</p>
<p> </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is knownthat cancer can be caused by DNA methylation changes.</p>
<p>Epigenetic patterns are established, maintained and transferred into subsequent generations of somatic cells. But the epigenome retains a certain kind of plasticity and can be altered by environmental factors, for example the use of drugs, disrupting the ordered epigenetic patterns, leading to inappropriate function of genes, for example promoting or inhibiting cell growth or survival, or altering the decisions whether genes should be silenced or avtivated.</p>
<p>There are 2 sensitive periods in the development of the embryo, 2 stages of reprogramming of epigenetic marks.</p>
<p>The pre implantation period is when the largest reprogramming occurs. After implantation the epigenetic marks are reestablished and maintained in somatic cells, and the primordial germ cell development.</p>
<p>When the woman is pregnant, 3 generations are exposed to the drugs she is using. She herself, the embryo, and the primordial germ cells which will be the next generation. Therefore it is not advisable to use drugs during this period, because it can affect all 3 generations.</p>
<p>Also drug use to treat childhood tumors should be well considered, because disrupting the epigenetic machinery can be critical for all cell types, not only the cancer cells, and most of the time, the long term consequences are not known </p></div>
