    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are typically not methylated and are often found in the promoters of genes. However, a methylated CpG island is almost synonymous with silencing of the gene. In cancer, CpG islands of tumor repressor genes tend to become hypermethylated. And if a set of genes are hypermethylated, the phenotype is termed CIMP (CpG island methylator phenotype). This unusually high methylation of CpG islands leads to silencing of the underlying tumor repressor gene, which may control cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair. The silencing of these genes may then lead to the uncontrolled cell growth that is characteristic of cancer. As the cancer progresses, the tumors seem to accumulate more methylation. This may be because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable so cancer cells can pass their methylation patterns to their daughter cells. Furthermore, these patterns or epimutations may be rapidly selected for due to their conferring survival benefits to the cell.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, intergenic regions and repetitive elements tend to be methylated. It is likely that methylation in intergenic regions functions to maintain genomic integrity because we see that DNMT1 null cells display genomic instability. DNA methylation may also contribute to genomic stability by silencing cyptic start sites or cryptic splice sites. For repetitive elements, DNA methylation may silence the repeats to prevent transposition, lead to mutation of the repeats (meC to T) in promoters to prevent transposition, silence repeats to prevent transcription of neighboring genes due to strong promoters from the repeat or cryptic promoters, and prevent illegitimate recombination by compacting the chromatin. In normal cells, hypermethylation of these regions inhibits events that destabilize the genome, such as those described above. However, in cancer cells, hypomethylation of repetitive elements and intergenic regions may lead to cancer by causing disrupting this control and leading to genomic instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer cells frequently display loss of imprinting, or they no longer show monoallelic parent-of-origin specific expression. Thus, genes are either expressed or silenced from both parental alleles. A lot of imprinted genes associated with growth and this may be a reason why they contribute to cancer development. Both hypo- and hypermethylation of the imprint control region (ICR) can occur, depending on the particular ICR and the function of the genes found within that region.</p>
<p>For the H19/Igf2 cluster, the ICR is methylated in the paternal allele. Thus, the enhancers can act on Igf2, leading to its expression. For the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and CTCF can bind to the ICR. The enhancers can then act on H19, leading to the expression of H19. However, Igf2 will be silent in the maternal allele. In Wilm’s tumor, the H19/Igf2 cluster ICR is hypermethylated. Both the maternal and paternal alleles will be methylated, leading to expression of Igf2 from both alleles. Since Igf2 promotes growth, this phenotype contributes to tumorigenesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) so it leads to reduction in DNA methylation. Decitabine is a nucleoside analog so it can be incorporated into the DNA during replication. When DNA methyltransferase comes along to try to methylate the DNA, it becomes bound to the incorporated decitabine nucleoside irreversibly. Thus, decitabine only works on cells that are actively dividing. And since cancer cells rapidly divide, they are more severely affected by decitabine. Decitabine leads to DNA demethylation, leading to an anti-neoplastic effect. The hypermethylation of CpG sites in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes leads to the silencing of these genes and this contributes to cancer. This allows Decitabine to have an anti-tumor effect by reducing hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, the mechanism of action is still unclear and decitabine may have other effects on cancer cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and methylation patterns can be passed on to daughter cells, granddaughter cells, and so on. Thus, it possible for drugs that alter DNA methylation to have enduring effects on the epigenome ever after treatment with the drug is stopped. I would not recommend administering epigenetic drugs to younger patients. Since these drugs that affect DNA methylation are non-specific to cancer cells, they can potentially affect all cells throughout the body. We know that germ cell development and embryonic development are sensitive periods, which are periods where epigenetic marks are being established. Environmental insults to individuals during this time period may have great and lasting adverse effects on the DNA methylation of these individuals. Younger patients who may still have developing germ cells are one group of patients where I would not recommend DNA methyltransferase inhibitors because these drugs can adversely alter the patients’ epigenetic machinery.</p></div>
