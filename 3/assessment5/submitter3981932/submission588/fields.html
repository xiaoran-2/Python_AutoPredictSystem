    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally, CpG islands, often placed at promoters of genes, tend to be protected from methylation when the gene is expressed. Methylation at CpG island lead to silencing of the gene. In cancer, we observe a CpG island hypermethylation. When it occurs in the promoters of tumors suppressor genes, it silences these genes and consequently, favours cancer. For example, BRCA1 gene is silenced in breast cancer.</p>
<p>In intergenic regions and repetitive elements, DNA is methylated to maintain genomic integrity. But in cancer, these regions are hypomethylated. This leads to a genomic instability : illegitimate recombination between repeats (deletions, translocation, insertions), activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Then, genomic instability enhance tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>However, cancer by alteration of DNA methylation is context dependant.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the paternal allele H19/lgf2 cluster, H19 ICR is methylated. H19 is not expressed and CTCF is not activated. Therefore, enhancers, downstream, can access and activate lgf2. In the maternal allele, ICR is not methylated. H19 is expressed and CTCF is activated. Enhancers can access to H19, and CTCF can bind and block enhancers from Igf2 activation.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the ICR is hypermethylated in both alleles (maternal and paternal). Thus, Igf2 is overexpressed. The double dose of Igf2 leads to a tumor since Igf2 is a growth prommoting.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The epigenetic drug Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agents. It is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It decreases DNA methylation and increases expression of genes that have been silenced because of the disease. By hypermethylating, Decitabine can put back to normal gene expression and weaken the tumour.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylations are reversible, and are inherited by mitose. Thus, when DNA methylation is altered, the effects last during cell multiplication. Chemotherapy has more effects after the epigenetic drug treatment because the tumour cells remain altered even after the treatment.  A sensitive period is when epigenetic marks are set. Early development, and primordial germ cells development are the sensitive periods. If a patient is treated during a sensitive period, the drug may disrupt DNA methylation and have bad consequences on the baby of a pregnant woman, or on the primordial germ cell of the baby or child.</p></div>
