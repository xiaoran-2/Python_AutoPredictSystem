    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA Methylation silences gene expression, however normally CpG Islands are found in an unmethylated state. Hence its normal function  can best be taken as it being unmethylated at CpG islands, hence encouraging gene expression. However, in the case of cancer it is seen that there is hypermythylation of the CpG islands i.e. there is heavy methylation which is directly opposite to the normal function of unmethylated state. This hypermethylation contributes to the desease by silencing tumor suppressing genes and other helpful ICRs, as hypermethylation silences gene expression for all genes. It is also believed in the Knudson hypothesis for causation of cancer that DNA methylation can be one of the hits (cancer is caused by multiple hits to the DNA). </p>
<p>Also DNA methylation is normally found at the intergenic regions and repetitive element locis of the gene. hence in a normal function these regions are kept silent by the methylation and this in turn keeps the genetic integrity of the DNA. However when one sees a cancer gene; it is observed that apart from the hypermethylation at CpG islands, the rest of the gene especially the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated i.e. unmethylated and this leads to genomic instability. The fact that these two loci are unmethylated results in them being freely expressed and also quite unstable. Genomic instability has been proven in the laboratory in  mouse trials where deletion of DNMT1 leads to genetic instability, also observed when mutations of DNMT3B in humans results in ICF syndrome. Hence, the genome wide hypomethylation which makes the gene unstable combined with the silencing of tumor suppressing genes at CpG island hypermethylation result in cancer; in other words, these both are two hits to the DNA under Knudson hypothesis.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the normal version of the H19/lgf2 cluster, the ICR of the paternal allele is methylated and the allele on the maternal side is unmethylated. This is caused by the fact that the Integrated Control Region (ICR) is bound by an insulator protien CTFC when unmethylated. CTFC also insulates the action of the downstream enhancers from Igf2 reducing its expression, leaving the enhancers to act on H19 which in turn leads  to the expression of the Long non coding rna H19 on the maternal side. On the paternal side the methylated ICR prevents CTFC from forming, this results  in the downstream enhancers to act on Igf2 hence enhancing its expression. In the case of Wilm's tumor we have hypermythylation, hence both maternal as well as paternal alleles are methylated and in both cases Igf2 is enhanced leaving no expression of H19. </p>
<p>Igf2 is a growth promoting gene expression, hence the "double dose" of this results in the over expression of the growth promoting genes and this results in the forming of a tumor in the patient known as Wilm's tumor, which forms at a very early age. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA Hypomythelating or DNA Demythelating agent class of epigenetic inhibitor. The drug acts to remove DNA methylation from genes it comes in contacts with, hence stimulating their expression. This could be a case where the drug is made to act on DNA that is associated with tumor suppression but due to the hypermethylation of its CpG island di-neuclotide it is unable to be expressed. Hence an injection of Decitabine to the DNA of the tumor would result in the hypomethylation of the CpG islands of the tumor suppressing gene, causing it to be enhanced considerably. Thereby having an anti tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation or other epigenetic marks can have enduring effects on the epigenome; this is due to the fact that epigenetic marks are mitotically heritable, hence they remain stable for a long time once induced; there are well documented cases in mice and cohort studies, of epigenomes being transferred from parent to offspring. This means that during the period of epigenetic reprogramming at the embryogenisis and the gametogenisis stages of development there is incomplete reprogramming in respect to epigenetic marks. This period is also know as the sensitive stage, it is  " <span>A period of epigenetic reprogramming: the clearing and resetting of epigenetic marks" (quiz 4). Treating patients during sensitive periods would be highly inadvisable as due to the transgenerational heritability of Epigenitic marks through the gametes, treatment and all its ill effects on the germ cells would unfortunately be inherited by the children of the treated patient as well as the grandchildren. Like the Overkalix example which showed people who ate too much between ages of 10-15 had a higher chance of siring grandchildren with diabetes and other health related disorders.</span></p></div>
