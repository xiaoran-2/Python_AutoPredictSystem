    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in disease situations such as cancer. DNA methylation is the only epigenetic mechanism that is known to directly modify the DNA. It plays an important role for gene control during development and cell differentiation, and it is a  target in cancer research.<strong></strong>  In cancer cells promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which then causes silencing of the underlying gene. <span>Intragenic methylation is found at repetitive sequences such as satellite repeats and remnants of retroviral insertions such as LINEs and SINEs in human DNA.                                                                              </span>DNA methylation is a very stable epigenetic mark, which is passed on to subsequent cell generations, reprogramming of DNA methylation occurs during gametogenesis and after fertilization or after artificial reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells  ,                                <span>DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification, resulting in the addition of a methyl (CH3) group at the carbon 5 position of the cytosine ring.    <span>Cancer has both a genetic and epigenetic basis.</span><span>Epigenetic alterations are ubiquitous and an alternative to genetic changes such as mutations and transposition in gene disruption.</span><span>The cancer stem cell model suggests that epigenetic changes, which occur in normal stem or early progenitor cells, are the earliest events in cancer initiation. This view is strongly supported by the finding that DNA methylation–induced silencing of tumor suppressor genes occurs in the earliest stages of tumor genesis.<span>The repressive chromatin modifications in cancer cells resemble those observed in normal embryonic stem cells, which may help prevent stem/precursor cells from committing to differentiation until programmed to do so. <span>The bivalent chromatin pattern may render groups of genes more vulnerable to errors that result in recruitment of aberrant promoter DNA methylation early during the progression of adult cancers, abnormally locking in the silenced state of genes (particularly prodifferentiation genes) and making them incapable of responding properly to differentiation cues. </span></span></span></span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>
<p><span>Mammals inherit two complete sets of chromosomes, one from the mother and one from the father, and most autosomal genes will be expressed from both the maternal and the paternal alleles. Imprinted genes, however, are expressed from only one chromosome, in a parent-of-origin–dependent manner. Because silent and active promoters are present in a single nucleus, the differences in activity cannot be explained by transcription-factor abundance. Furthermore, because of their parent-of-origin–restricted expression, phenotypes determined by imprinted genes are susceptible not only to genetic alterations in the genes but also to disruptions in the epigenetic programs controlling regulation.</span></p>
<p><span> Imprinted genes are often associated with human diseases, including disorders affecting cell growth, development, and behavior.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In humans (and other mammals like mice and pigs) the </span><em>IGF2</em><span> allele inherited from the father (paternal) is expressed; the allele inherited from the </span></span>mother is not.</p>
<p><span>Imprinting can be considered a multistep developmental process. First, the chromosome must be marked as to its parental origin. </span></p>
<p><span>Second, a parent-of-origin mark must be stably maintained as the cells divide and differentiate. </span></p>
<p><span> Third, a parent-of-origin mark must be recognized by the transcriptional machinery, so as to result in monoallelic expression. </span></p>
<p><span>Finally, and specific to germ cells, the mark must be erased and reset. </span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.

            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Decitabine is a hyponethylating agent who </span><span> hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Decitabine recovers expression of silenced genes on chromosome 11q13 and has antineoplastic effects in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) cells.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Decitabine, as a hypomethylating agent that allows for the re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, represents an exciting new treatment option </span></p>
<p><span>for tumors. </span></p>
<p><span> Decitabine has been shown to be well tolerated with a toxicity profile expected for this class of agent.</span></p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>

    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Changes to the epigenome can result in changes to the structure of chromatin</span><span> and changes to the function of the genome.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sensitive Period is a developmental term and refers to a time when a child is particularly receptive to certain kinds of environmental experiences.</span><span><br /><br /><br /></span></span></p></div>
