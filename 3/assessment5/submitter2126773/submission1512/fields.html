    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Changes in DNA methylation in ICRs, both hypermethylation as hypomethylation can result in mistakes in cases of cancer in gene imprinting, causing overexpression of parental alleles or silencing of these, particularly those involved in growth. In normal cells, in the paternal allele the control region is methylated and then enhancers act on the Igf2 gene is only expressed because the f CFTC 4 will not bind to the methylated control region and the H19 gene is silenced. On the maternal allele, the control region is not methylated, and then element insulator, CTFC 4 binds to the control region and enhances act on the H19 gene, and it is expressed, the IgF2 gene is silenced in the maternal allele. In cancer cells imprinting is lost and develops the Wilm's tumor, in this case, the maternal allele has also methylated in the control region and has no expression of H19, but as in the IGF2 paternal allele, then there is a double dose of IGF2 compared with normal cells leading to the development of cancer.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The DNA methylation is required for cell differentiation and control of multiple biological processes, such as cell cycle and gene expression, usually, found in CpG islands in promoter regions of genes. In general, CpGs islands are little methylated in active genes and hard methylated in silenced gene. Aberrations in epigenetic control may occur in regions hypermethylation or locus-specific hypomethylation Cpg islands in control tumor suppressor genes, silencing them in regions of repetitive elements, and loss of imprinting in ICRs. Healthy cells in general are hypomethylation in CpG islands and there hypermethylation in regions of repetitive elements and intergenic regions. In cancer cells, the opposite occurs, usually regions of CpG islands are methylated, and regions of repetitive elements and are in hypomethylation. Generally, these CpG islands that are methylated in cancer are found in promoters of tumor suppressor genes then these genes are silenced, and control is lost. The silencing of repetitive elements in the genome is important to maintain stability, with the hypomethylation of these regions these elements are active and can promote DNA damage due to its instability.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent, ie, acts by inhibiting the enzymes DNMTs being incorporated into DNA chains preventing the action of DNMT. With the use of the drug containing decitabine, this will inhibit the action of enzymes of DNA methylation and lead to tumor suppression activity by the resumption of tumor suppressor genes.</p>
<p>Thus, the decitabine can be used as epigenetic treatment, for example, in the case of myelodysplastic syndrome, the manifestation of cancer which is due to hypermethylation and hence the silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>It is known that DNA methylation is heritable mitotically. Methyl groups are added to the DNA enzyme family DNMTs, DNMT1 seems to be responsible for the maintenance of the methylation pattern throughout the development while the DNMTs 3a and 3b appear to be responsible for the creation of methylation 'new' in cells cancer these functions are not well understood. Despite the positive results in epigenetic drug treatment, there are some periods such as pregnancy and lactation and growth stage in the use of these should be avoided. For example, decitabine has not recommended its use for pregnant women and during breastfeeding because it can cause severe damage to the embryo or newborn, also for men and women of reproductive age, it is recommended not playing since the drug can cause mutations and even infertility.</span></p></div>
