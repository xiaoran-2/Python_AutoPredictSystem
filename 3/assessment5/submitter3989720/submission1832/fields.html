    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can either be specific to a gene, known as locus specific DNA methylation or can be found throughout the genome, known as genome wide DNA methylation. In a normal cell, CPG islands are usually hypomethlyated and the rest of the genome is hypermethlyated. However, within a cancer cell, the opposite occurs- the CPG islands are likely to be hypermethlyated and the rest of the genome is likely to be hypomethylated. Since CPG islands are usually found at promoters of tumor suppressor genes, the DNA hypermethylation in a cancer cell silences the tumor suppressor genes. In turn, the tumor suppressor genes are inhibited from functioning and containing potential tumors. This DNA hypermethylation is quite frequent and also mitotically heritable for the next generation. Furthermore, as this process accumulates over time, one is more likely to suffer from cancer with age. DNA hypermethylation has known to play an active part in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, etc. In cancer cells, the hypomethylation that occurs in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is usually case-specific, but it is known that it occurs to a degree in mostly all tumor types. Although this hypomethylation occurs in CPG poor promoters, it is most likely found in repeats or intergenic regions. Genome-wide hypomethylation causes DNA to be loosely bound and this is associated with expression of unwanted or extraneous genes. For example, this hypomethylation can cause improper chromosome recombination, in which parts of chromosomes are inserted, deleted, or even exchanged from different chromosomes. Moreover, the hypomethylation can cause activation of repeats that may move around the genome as transposons or even activation of neighboring genes. Any and all of these lead to genomic instability and an increased chance of cancer as seen from mouse models and human cancers.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA hypermethylation and/or hypomethylation can occur at imprint control regions, also known as ICR’s and lead to reduced imprinting. This can lead to either dual expression or silencing from both the paternal and maternal allele. In the case of the Igf2/H19 cluster, the ICR on the paternal allele is hypermethylated, and therefore silenced, while the ICR on the maternal allele is hypomethylated, and therefore expressed through the H19 gene via enhancers. So, in a normal cell, the maternal allele expressed the H19 gene and the paternal allele expresses the Igf2 gene. However, in a cancer cell, both the paternal and the maternal allele have hypermethylated ICR’s, which leads to a loss of imprinting. Here, there is now a dual expression of the Igf2 gene and no expression of the H19 gene. Since the Igf2 gene is growth promoting, there now exists a dosage twice the normal amount which causes double the cell growth. This causes Wilm’s tumor, which is targets kidneys in children. The loss of imprinting often occurs very early in the process of tumorigensis, making is difficult to predict the manifestation of the tumor itself. This, in turns, contributes to disease. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The article “Cancer’s Epicentre” discusses multiple drugs that may counteract the adverse effects of epigenetics on cancer. One drug,Decibatine, is already in circulation and is used to treat patients with precursor syndromes related to myelogenous leukaemia (Cancer's epicentre). This drug belongs to a class of epigenetic inhibitors known as DNA-demethylating agents. Although the effect of the drug on hypomethlyation may be limited, it can control and contain areas of the genome that are hypermethylated. Since there are multiple areas of the genome that are epigenetically hypermethlyated such as specific loci, repetitive elements, and ICR’s, this may a breakthrough in terms of reversing the hypermethylation by removing methyl groups in these regions. With the proper amount of methylation, the genome would be able to function normally and therefore, this could have an anti-tumour effect and provide a treatment to cancer at least on the epigenetic level.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic drugs can provide a treatment to cancer that may be lasting within a person’s generation and even into the next generation. This is because epigenetic changes are mitotically heritable and are passed down from mother to daughter cells until they are erased by the genome itself (Cancer's Epicentre). However, there are sensitive periods in which treatment would adversely affect the patient. A sensitive period is any period of time in which the environment can affect the epigenetic control of a person within his/her lifetime as well as the lifetime of his/her offspring. There are two times in development defined to be sensitive- the time of primordial germ cell development and pre-implantation and early post implantation period. These times are sensitive because the epigenome is going through the active motion of removing and laying down epigenetic marks. During this time, temperature, diet, and other changes in environment are very likely to effect epigenetic control. So, treating patients during this period would cause an adverse effect on patients. Rather, treatments should be done in the somatic maintenance period in a person’s lives, during which the epigenome is less sensitive. </p>
