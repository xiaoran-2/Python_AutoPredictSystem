    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Methylation of DNA occurs by adding a single methyl group to cytosine at position 5. In mammals the cytosine almost always has to preceed a guanin. Although methylated cytosine is prone to point mutation it is required for proper embryogenesis and development, chromosomal stability, telomere length, and predetermined gene expression (2).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">While CpG dinucleotides are under-represented in the genome they are often clustered in the promoter region of genes, the so called CpG islands. Methylation of those CpG islands leads to silencing the gene expression by the formation of a dense chromatin structure through interaction with CpG binding proteins like MeCP1/MeCP2, or by prohibition of transcription factor binding. Usually CpG islands tend to be unmethylated and thus not silencing the associated gene.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In contrast to CpG islands the CpG dinucleotides in intergenic regions are usually methylated and thereby help maintain genomic integrity by reducing chromosome insertions, deletions, and translocations through silencing of cryptic transcription start or cryptic splice sites.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Repetitive elements – like intergenic regions – are also usually methylated to support genomic integrity. Due to methylation silencing or mutation of the repeats may prevent transposition and avoid transcriptional interference from strong promoters. Furthermore the methylation of repeats may prevent illegitimate recombination.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In cancer cells however the CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated so that expression of the associated gene is decreased. In contrast, the intergenic regions and the repetitive elements are hypomethylated leading to more genomic instability. A genomic change affecting a gene can lead to a decrease in functional transkripts (1).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">A decrease in growth controlling factors such like tumor suppressors either due to gene silencing or genomic instability lead to an uncontrolled growth of the affected cell and thus of its descendants as the disrupted methylation pattern as well as genomic changes will be mitotically inheritable</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:small;">Some genes are usually expressed from only 1 allele in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. They are located in clusters whose expression is controlled by an Imprint Control Region (ICR). There are different ways how the ICR results in expression of its controlled genes but it is always associated with methylation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">An example of an imprinted cluster is the H19/Igf2 cluster located on human chromosome 11. Its ICR can be bound by the insulator protein CTCF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small;">The paternal allele has a methylated ICR. This methylation prevents binding of CTCF and is spread to the promoter of the downstream H19. Thereby expression of H19 is silenced but the downstream enhancers now can enhance the expression of the upstream IGF2 gene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">The maternal allele has an unmethylated ICR that can be bound by CTCF preventing the expression of IGF2 and enhancing the expression of H19 through the downstream enhancers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">In Wilms tumor the ICR of the maternal allele is also methylated resulting in CTCF binding and thereby expression of IGF2 and silencing of H19 from the maternal allele. This disruption leads to an overexpression of growth promoting factor IGF2 now expressed from both alleles, causing increased cell growth. (1)</span></span></p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span style="font-size:small;">The drug Decita</span><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">bine belongs to the DNA-demethylating agents by inhibiting the DNA-methyltransferases. It is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into the DNA during cell division. Subsequently the DNMT is irreversibly bound to the incorporated agent thus not being able to methylate anything anymore. While toxic in high doses it decreases DNA methylation at lower doses leading to hypomethylated, or demethylated DNA respectively (1).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:small;">Tumors that rely on hypermethylation of CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes can be treated with Decitabine to decrease methylation of those islands and thereby increase expression of tumor suppressor genes again (1).</span></span></p>
