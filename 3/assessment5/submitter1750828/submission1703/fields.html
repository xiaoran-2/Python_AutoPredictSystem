    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is essential for normal development. </span>DNA methylation occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides and is carried out through maintenance methylation and <em>de novo</em> methylation.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is important in the development of nearly all types of cancer. Cancer cells typically exhibit aberrant DNA methylation patterns that can drive malignant transformation. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation compared to normal tissue, have been associated with malignancies. Hypermethylation typically occurs at CpG islands in the promoter region and is associated with gene inactivation. Hypomethylation is implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms. In cancer cells, gene promoter CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated, which results in transcriptional silencing of the gene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, RNA polymerase starts randomly transcribing DNA and the presence of transcription factors increases the transcription of genes. Hypomethylation has an impact in chromosomal and transcriptional stability of the genome, due to the presence of illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, activation of cryptic promoters and disruption to neighbouring genes. Depletion of DNA methylation appears to enhance tumorigenesis</p>
<p>Repetitive elements represent a large portion of the human genome and contain much of the CpG methylation found in normal somatic tissues. Loss of DNA methylation in these sequences might account for the hypomethylation that characterises human cancers.  DNA hypomethylation is likely to aid in tumor formation and progression by many different pathways, including effects on transcription in cis.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The H19 gene is expressed exclusively on one parental allele in a phenomenon known as imprinting. In most tissues IGF2 is expressed from the paternal allele only, while H19 is only expressed from the maternal inherited allele, while the paternal H19 allele is not expressed. This coupled expression is only lost when there is loss of imprinting (inherited CpG methylated) or promoter mutation<span style="font-size:11px;line-height:0px;">.</span></p>
<p>In Wilms tumour, has been associated with allele loss at 11p15.5 which seems to be specific for the maternally inherited allele, the significance of which is demonstrated by the pattern of imprinting of genes within the region of common allele loss. IGF2 gene which is maternally imprinted (paternally expressed), if there is maternal allele loss this will lead to either no change in effective gene dosage, or to increased gene dosage if there is associated paternal duplication. It has been shown that the maternal IGF2 imprint is relaxed which causes the gene to be expressed biallelically, and this has been associated with undetectable or very low levels of H19 expression.</p>
<p>Disruption on imprinting gene expression represents an evolutionary conflict, where natural selection favours different expression strategies for maternally and paternally inherited alleles.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a drug which is used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes, for instance it helps in medical conditions in which certain blood cells are dysfunctional. Decitabine is a hypomethylating or de-methylating agent, in other words, is capable of hypomethylating<span> DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. Has an e<span>ffect on the DNA of genes that control cell growth, and <span>can be incorporated into DNA strands. <span>Treatment of cancer cells, with low doses of this drug can cause changes in gene expression, and important signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Resetting or reprogramming abnormal epigenetic state might be the most proeminent therapy that can blunt multiple tumor signaling pathways, changes in the pattern of gene expression without changing primary DNA sequence, which leads to persistent epigenetic changes after withdrawn of the drug treatment. The new expression patterns are accompanied by a new cellular phenotype, in order words, anti-tumor effects.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>DNA methylation is postulated for indirect effects in which acute exposure to a drug influences signaling pathways that may lead to an alteration of transcription factor activity at gene promoters, which results in the altered expression of receptors and signaling molecules necessary to alter genetic regulatory circuits. When exposed chronically, cells adapt and this results in a more permanent modifications and chromatin structure, leading to enduring alteration of a given epigenetic network. Therefore, it has been shown that drug's effect may persist after it has been discontinued.</span></p>
<p>A sensitive period is a special sensitivity that occurs as a strong spontaneous desire to learn and master some skill or concept, it is usually a period of transitory and varies its duration. The time is spent to the acquire a particular desired skill or concept and once is acquired, the desire to learn and master it, disappears.</p>
<p>There are several sensitive periods during development, they are mainly divided in six different groups: Language, order, sensory refinement, refinement of motor skills, sensitivity to small objects and social behaviour.</p></div>
