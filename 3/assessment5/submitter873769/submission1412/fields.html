    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are 300 or greater nucleotide regions found in 70% of human promoters and are hypomethylated in normal cells.   During nornmal tissue differentiation, epigenetic marks silence un-needed proteins for the tissue type.   In cancer, CpG islands are hypermethylated leading to suppression of the coding region associated with the promoter.  A significant number of hypermethylated CpG promoters are associated with tumor suppressors, such as P53, which induces cellular apoptosis. Supression of tumor suppressor expression can constitude a single hit in the Knudson hypothesis and predispose to cancer.</p>
<p>Intergenic regions and repeats are normally hypermethylated in normal cells but progressively hypomethylate in cancer resulting in transpositions, deletions and additions which lead to genomic instability.  If repeats are transcribed, a condition of microsatelite instability can occur.   Repeats can be transcribed due to loss of methylation on the region, and can incorporate into the DNA with mismatches.  In conjunction with underexpression of DNA mismatch repair enzymes, possibly due to the hypermethylation of its promoter, such mismatches can perpetuate uncorrected.  This may result in mistranslated proteins and enzymes with loss of functionality, or deletion of entire genes.</p>
<p>Additionally many intragenic regions establish sequences for non-coding RNA.  While just over 1% of the human genome codes for proteins, much of the remainder is involved in RNA encoding. Transcribed non-coding RNA acts as regulators for gene expression and disruption of methylation of the intragenic and repeated regions can disrupt equilibrium in regulatory mechanisms. Such disruption manifests in disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cells, the paternal allele is methylated at the Igf2/H19 imprint control region (ICR) on human chromosome 11p15.5 preventing the binding of a CTCF protein which acts as a blocking factor.  Downstream enhancers promote expression of Igf2  preferentially over the H19 gene.  In the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated binding CTCF and blocking the action of the downstream enhancers on Igf2 and expressing H19 as a result.  In Wilm’s disease, both alleles are hypermethylated at the ICR blocking the action of CTCF resulting in Igf2 expression from both alleles – providing a double dose of growth factors.    Wilm’s disease, a nephroblastoma, is characterized by overgrowth of kidney tissue and it has been noted that Wilm’s cells behave like renal stem cells (which show little or no imprinting). Scott [1] showed 69% of Wilm’s tumors displayed epigenetic abnormalities in the 11p15 region indicating that abnormal methylation in the imprinting region is a likely contributory factor. Imprint disruption also causes Beckwidth-Weiderman syndrome through over expresion of IGF2 and/or underexpression of CDKN1C .</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a class of DNA demethylating agents.  Delivered into the cytoplasm and imported into the nucleus, Decitabine acts as a DNA methyltransferase inhibiting agent.   In vivo, it is phosphorylated and incorporates into DNA and covalently binds with DNA methyltransferase.   Non-proliferating cells are relatively unaffected by Decitabine suggesting that its action is passive resulting in progressive hypomethylation of DNA after each mitotic division.  By binding to and inactivating DNMT enzymes,  Decitabine eliminates the mitotic heritability of the abnormal epigenetic marks.  Induced hypomethylation of neoplastic cells restores normal gene action.  Since tumors can result from hypermethylation at promoters for tumor suppressor genes, reduction of promoter methylation can restore the action of such tumor suppressors.  Decitabine would be contraindicated for cancers induced through genomic instability resulting from hypomethylation of intragenic regions or repetitive regions, and would likely exacerbate the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since DNA methylation is mitotically heritable, via DNA methyltransferase enzymes actively methylating daughter strands, epigenome changes related to DNA methylation are preserved. Tumors treated with a DNMT inhibitor, while not resolving tumor growth, may render the tumor susceptible to other cytotoxic drugs – perhaps in lower doses. For example, cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug’s mechanism of action is binding preferentially to guanine in DNA, crosslinking DNA and inducing apoptosis.  Since apoptosis is mediated through tumor suppressors (e.g P53) which are typically hypermethylated, changes in epigenetic marks that upregulate tumor suppressor expression could allow cisplatin to be more effective.     </p>
<p>Any period where epigenetic marks are being reprogrammed constitutes a sensitive period.  This includes early embryo development from fertilization through post implantation up to significant tissue differentiation where the epigenetic marks are stable (epiblast).  It also includes the period where primordial germ cells (PGCs) are developing in testes and ova (gametogenesis), especially with respect to parental imprinting.  Sperm development to10 years and ova to 12 years are sensitive periods.   Treatment with epigenetically altering therapeutic agents, such as Decitabine, has the potential to disrupt embryo development and imprinting in germ cells.  Decitabine is specifically noted in the prescribing monograph as fetotoxic and embryotoxic.</p></div>
