    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Normally DNA at CpG islands in hypomethylated, however in cancer they are often hypermethylated. The consequence of hypermethylation is silencing the tumor supressor genes (the hypermethylation is often found in the promotors of these genes). Because DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and because epimutations are rapidly selected for, the CpG island hypermethylation is a good alternative to DNA mutations for silecing these genes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Normally DNA is hypermethylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, buth these regins are more likely hypomethylated in cancer. The consequences of hypomethylation depends on the location of the epimutation. It can cause genomic instabillity, due to illegitimate recombination between repeats, which occurs, because the DNA is not correctly packaged in heterochromatin. The result of genomic instabillity can be chromosomal  deletions, insertions or translocations. Repeats can also be activated - they can copy themselves and transpose around the genome - that can result in disruption or activation of te neighbouring genes (e.g. the Agouty or Axin genes).</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The common feature of cancer cells is loss of imprinting (normally imprinted genes are in cancer cells expressed or silenced from both parental alleles), probably because many genes that are imprinted are involved in growth. The loss of imprinting is a result of hyper or hypo methylation of imprint control regions and consequently the expression of growth restricting genes can be lost and the growth promoting genes can be overexpressed.</p>
<p>The H19/Igf2 cluster ICR is normaly methylated in paternal allele and unmethylated in maternal allele. When it is unmethylated, CTCF will bind to it and enhancers will act on H19 and Igf2 will be silenced. In paternal allele the insulator element won't bind to methylated ICR and the enhancers can act on Igf2, which is then expressed. With loss of imprinting, the ICR is hypermethylated also on the maternal allele and the Igf2 is expressed from both alleles. Igf2 is growth promoting and in because of the loss of imprinting it is expressed in double dose. In wilms tumor, the maternal allele is methylated and overexpression of Igf2 is seen.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes. It is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMT), which irreversibly binds DNMT and inhibits their action in dividing cells.  And because cancer cells are dividing rapidla it affects them most. Besides demethylation the drug could have other effects which are yet unclear. Myelodysplastic syndromes outcome is dependant on CpG island hypermethylation and that is probably the reason decitabine works so well in these patients.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effect on the epigenome, because  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable. Altered DNA methylation is passed on from the mother cell to the next generations.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods when epigenetic marks are being established - pre-implantation development and germ cell development/maturation. I wouldn't treat patients before puberty with such drugs (slow growth periods) or pregnant women.</p></div>
