    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer can result from a combination of oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation. In general, methylation would not be present in CpG islands. Methylation of CpG islands is usually associated with the formation of a repressive chromatin structure and will lead to gene silencing. In cancer, CpG islands are commonly hypermethylated. CpG islands are found in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes, in general.  DNA methylation is mitotically heritable and is very effective for silencing tumor suppressor genes. Epimutations are rapidly selected for and will eventually take over, causing disease.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, there is little to no methylation at CpG islands, but noticeable methylation in repetitive elements, intergenic regions, and introns. In cancer cells, however,  CpG islands are commonly hypermethylated and these other regions (repetitive elements and intergenic regions) are often hypomethylated. The consequence of hypomethylation in these repeats and intergenic regions leads to genomic instability. The loss of methylation removes this stability, which results in abnormal karyotypes from illegitimate recombinations including deletions, insertions and translocations. In a normal cell, these illegitimate recombinations between repeats would not occur because repeats would be heavily methylated and heterochromatinized. Hypomethylation can cause activation of repeats and transposition of genes, but also cryptic promoter activation and disruption to neighboring genes; all of this together leads to that instability of the genome, which can cause disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Any alterations to the DNA methylation at the imprint control regions can result in a loss of expression of growth-restricting genes and overexpression of growth-promoting genes. In a normal cell, the imprint control region (ICR) on the maternal allele is unmethylated, this allows the insulator protein CTCF to bind to the ICR and prevent the downstream enhancers from expressing Igf2. In the paternal allele, DNA methylation at the ICR blocks binding of CTCF. The DNA methylation spreads to the H19 promoter to silence it and then the enhancers can access and activate Igf2 from the paternal allele.</p>
<p>In a non-normal cell, both alleles would be either hyper or hypo-methylated. In the case of Wilm’s tumor, hypermethylation will lead to expression of Igf2 from both parental alleles, causing a double dose of Igf2 which is a growth promoting gene.</p>
<p>Common feature of cancer cells show a loss of imprinting, either expressing from both parental alleles, or silencing of both parental alleles. Many genes that are imprinted are involved in growth some way, either promoting or repressing, so any changes in methylation of the ICR can have negative effects to the cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a small molecule DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) that works as a DNA demethylating agent. It is a nucleoside analogue that can irreversibly bind DNMT after incorporation into the DNA after replication. This irreversible binding prevents further methylation by DNMT throughout the gene. Cells that are replicating very rapidly would be most severely affected by DNMTi, as in cancer cells. It essentially reverses the epigenetic alterations (methylation) that can lead to tumors, by targeting enzymatic epigenetic regulators (DMNT).</p>
<p>DNMT inhibitors are most effective against Myelodysplastic syndrome because this syndrome is dependent on CpG island hypermethylation. Demethylating these CpG islands on tumor-suppressing genes would therefore have an anti-tumor effect. When DNMT inhibitors like Decitabine are taken at an appropriate dose, it acts to demethylate genes including the CpG islands in tumor suppressing genes, reversing the effects of this syndrome, while causing little effect on normal cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When referring to epigenetic drugs acting in a lasting way, Dr. Baylin was referring to the mitotic heritability of the epigenome. If the cancer-causing epigenetic marks are passed to each daughter cell without any changes, cancer will endure, but if these cancer-causing epigenetic marks are erased, the subsequent generations of cells may not be cancerous.</p>
<p>Sensitive periods occur when epigenetic marks are being established (epigenetic reprogramming), rather than maintained. Sensitive periods include both embryogenesis and gametogenesis. Those that may be in periods of cell differentiation including early childhood or pregnancy would most likely be advised against taking any DNA methylation-altering drugs. It would be important to avoid treating these patients with drugs that can alter DNA methylation as the drug could not discriminate which genes to epigenetically alter. The methylation that is necessary to prevent insertions, deletions, and translocations would not be re-established, leading to systemic DNA mistakes. Even if adults don’t necessarily have these sensitive periods, if just one cell is adversely affected and cannot maintain epigenetic state, downstream consequences can result in a tumor. </p></div>
