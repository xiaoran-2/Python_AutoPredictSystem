    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark that is vital to genomic stability. When it malfunctions, cancer may result. In the normal cells, DNA methylation has a different role depending on the genomic region. Methylation of CpG islands tends to silence genes since these areas are usually promoters. Usually, methylation in these regions is minimal and gene expression is not silenced. On the other hand, intergenic regions and repetitive elements are heavily methylated. These sections of DNA do not code for genes and are usually harmful to other genes. Therefore, they are methylated in order to repress transcription and maintain genomic integrity. In cancer, DNA methylation is altered. CpG islands are hypermethylated and intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. The increased methylation of CpG islands causes increased silencing of genes, including tumor suppressor genes. These important genes normally regulate the cell cycle and prevent aberrant growth. When these genes are silenced by methylation of their promoters, the cell cycle can break down and the cell may become cancerous. The rest of the genome, especially intergenic regions and repetitive elements, becomes hypomethylated in cancer. These regions contain transposons elements that are free for transcription after methylation is removed. In summary, hypermethylation of CpG islands silences “good” DNA that stops cancerous growth, and hypomethylation of repetitive elements activates “bad” DNA that can damage the genome and lead to cancerous cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the process by which one allele, either maternal or paternal, is silenced. Therefore only one allele is transcribed and expressed. This process is vital for proper function of the organism. For example, incorrect imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster can lead to Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome and subsequent Wilm’s tumor growth. Under normal conditions, the paternal imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and the maternal ICR is unmethylated. On the maternal allele, an insulator protein, CTCF, binds to the unmethylated ICR. Enhancers downstream of the ICR normally promote the transcription of Igf2. However, CTCF blocks this action and the enhancers promote H19 instead. On the paternal allele, CTCF cannot bind to the ICR because of methylation. The enhancer proteins can therefore promote Igf2 and not H19. In the case of Wilm’s tumors, the maternal ICR in methylated so that is resembles the paternal allele. Both alleles will then produce Igf2, an oncogene. Igf2 promotes growth, which under normal circumstances is fine. However, when both alleles produce Igf2, its quantity becomes too high and can spur the cell to become cancerous. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) that has been developed the treat certain types of cancer. DNMT is the enzyme that restores DNA methylation after replication. In other words, it allows DNA methylation to be mitotically heritable. Decitabine stops the action of this enzyme, and so indirectly decreases DNA methylation. In most cancers, methylation is increased at CpG islands. This silences genes, most notability tumor suppressor genes. When decitabine is administered, it should decrease the methylation at these CpG island promoters. This will free tumor suppressor genes for transcription. By increasing these anti-tumor proteins, decitabine has an anti-tumor effect. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A hallmark of epigenetic marks is that they are mitotically heritable. That is, once established, the epigenome of a cell will be passed down to its daughter cells (unless it is cleared). When the DNA is copied, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) copy the methylation as well. As long as DNMT is present, DNA methylation can be sustained indefinitely. There are a couple time periods, however, in which DNA methylation, and other epigenetic marks are cleared and re-established. These periods are called sensitive periods, because the epigenome is very sensitive to environmental factors. The two main sensitive periods are early development of the embryo (around the time of implantation) and primordial germ cell development (development of the sperm or oocytes). During most other periods, the epigenome is pretty stable. However, during these two periods, various proteins are actively shaping the epigenome, including DNA methylation. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during these periods would not be safe. The epigenetic marks are not yet locked in and the drugs could alter them. Once changed, the epigenetic marks would most likely remain for the life of the organism. Therefore, epigenetic drugs should not be given during sensitive periods for risk of serious, permanent damage. </p></div>
