    <div class="field-value"><p>Cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled growth of cells.  In normal healthy cells, DNA is methylated in a way that keeps cell growth under control.  However in cancerous cells DNA methylation tends to be reversed, which permits cell growth to get out of control and may result in cancer tumors.</p>
<p>CpG islands often occur at or near transcription promoters for tumor suppressor genes.  In normal healthy cells, CpG islands are typically unmethylated.  Since they are unmethylated, CpG islands permit the tumor suppressors upstream to be activated which then produce proteins needed to protect cells from some sources of cancer.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, disruptive epigenetic modifications occur and methylation of CpG sites is reversed.  CpG islands change from unmethylated to methylated.  Methylation of CpG islands is called hypermethylation.  Hypermethylation can result in inactivation of tumor suppressors.</p>
<p>Disruption of DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to disease because production of tumor suppressor proteins is inactivated and these proteins are needed to protect cells.   Hypermethylation can be one of the hits in the Knudson hypothesis.  The result of not having active tumor suppressors is that tumors can grow and metastasis can occur.</p>
<p>Lower density CpG sites are found in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  In normal healthy cells, CpG sites tend to be methylated.  Methylation of these CpG sites is needed for chromosome stability and to inhibit activation of oncogenes.</p>
<p>In cancer cells, methylation of CpG sites at integenic regions and repetitive elements is disruptively reversed.  In these areas, the CpG sites change from methylated to unmethylated.  This is called hypomethylation.</p>
<p>Genome-wide hypomethylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements can cause genomic instability such as illegitimate recombination between repeats, disruption to neighboring genes, and activation of repeats, transposition, and cryptic promoters.  Hypomethylation of CpG poor promoters can result in onocogene activation.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer.  This has been documented in the H19/IGF2 cluster in which a loss of imprinting on the IGF2  (insulin-like growth factor II) gene has been identified in several embryonal cancers including a rare form of kidney cancer called Wilm’s tumor.</p>
<p>IGF2 is in a cluster of genes on chromosome 11.  Normally in the paternal allele, the ICR (imprinting control region) in front of H19 is methylated and blocks CTCF binding.  Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to and silences H19.  Enhancers access and express IGF2 .</p>
<p>Normally in the maternal allele, the ICR in front of H19 is unmethylated and CTCF binding occurs.  CTCF is an insulator protein, it insulates IGF2 and the enhancers activate H19.  IGF2 is not expressed.</p>
<p>In many cases of Wilm’s tumors there is a loss of imprinting which causes the ICRs in both maternal and paternal alleles to be methylated.  This methylation spreads to and silences H19 on both alleles. The enhancers on both alleles activate IGF2 which overexpresses IGF2.</p>
<p>Disruption of imprinting at the H19/IGF2 cluster results in IGF2 being overexpressed.  IGF2 is a growth promoting hormone, when IGF2 is overexpressed cancers can develop.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a new class of epigenetic drugs known as DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors (DNMTi).  These drugs act as "demethylating" agents by inhibiting methylation of newly replicated cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue which irreversibly binds the DNA methyltransferese (DNMT) that has been incorporated into DNA.  When a cell divides, the bound DNMT is then unable to methylate the newly formed daughter cells.   Thus newly replicated cells have reduced methylation and the Decitabine helped to reduce overall DNA methylation.  For this to work, cells need to be replicating.  Cancer cells divide more rapidly and are therefore more affected than other cells.</p>
<p>Decitabine can have an anti-tumor effect by creating a more favorable DNA methylation profile with reduced hypermethylation.  CpG islands in newly replicated cells will be unmethylated which will enable expression of tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressors inhibit both metastasis and the production of cancer tumors.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because the new methylation state induced by the drugs can replicate when the cell replicates.  Therefore, even when the drug is no longer in the patients system the effects of the drug will continue. </p>
<p>Sensitive periods are periods of development when the environment (including drugs) can have the biggest influence on the organism’s epigenetic makeup.  Sensitive periods occur when the epigenome is being actively reprogrammed and epigenetic marks are being established.</p>
<p>There are two major sensitive periods of development.  The first is the early development period (pre-implantation and early post-implantation).  The second is the primordial germ cell development phase (primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm).  There are other brief windows in time when particular organisms will have sensitive periods, however those periods are less sensitive than the major periods.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods is not inadvisable because their epigenome is already actively being reprogrammed.  If you give a patient a drug that alters DNA methylation while their epigenetic marks are actively being established, this may result in an unfavorable epigenetic profile that could prove disastrous for the patient.</p></div>
