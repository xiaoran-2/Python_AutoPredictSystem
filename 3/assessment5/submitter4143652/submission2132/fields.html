    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the process of monoallelic, or only one parent, expression of genes.  This makes it extra susceptible to problems such as mutations, deletion, or uniparental disonomy.  A lot of imprinted genes are involved in growth.  When previously silenced genes encoding for a growth factor are activated by either hypo or hypermethylation, uncontrolled cell growth can cause cancer.</p>
<p>Normally the maternal allele’s ICR is unmethylated and CTCF attaches to it, CTCF is an insulator protein and blocks Igf2 from downstream enhancement, thus the enhancers acts on H19 (secondary loop) producing a longnoncoding RNA.  The paternal allele is imprinted or methylated at the ICR and methylated upstream at the H19.  Thus CTCF cannot access the ICR (due to heterochromatin or DNA methylation spreading), this means the preferential loop with Igf2 is acted upon by the enhancer.  Igf2 is a growth hormone, the cell grows normally.</p>
<p>Loss of imprinting leads to hypermethylation/disruption on the female imprinting region as well, leading the enhancer to act upon Igf2, as with the paternal allele, promoting increased growth and is associated with wilm’s tumor.  These are early stages of tumorgenesis and a hallmark of cancer which includes uncontrolled growth of cells.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a <span>DNA-demethylating agent or</span> DNMTi (DNA methyl transferase inhibitor).  How it works is that it is a nucleoside analog, so it gets incorporated into the DNA upon replication.  Its purpose is to irreversibly bind to DNA methyltransferase. When DNMT1 tries to bind to it, in order to copy the DNA methylation to the new strand of DNA, it binds to it irreversibly.  Cancers cells are the one’s that are dividing most rapidly and since this process is division dependent, it will most strongly affect cancerous cells.</p>
<p>Atlow dosages they are able hit the cancer cells the strongest and cause DNA demethylation as a caveat they could  also adversely target normal cells, since they also divide, the effects are not completely known.  It’s possible that they are preventing hypermethylated CPG islands and thus allowing the tumor suppressor genes to be expressed and naturally inhibit cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption
of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and repetitive elements contributes to
cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA-methylation at CPG islands leads to a silencing of gene expression (CPG islands are mostly found in promoters where transcription factors bind).  Normally CPG-islands are protected from DNA-methylation, with a few exception, e.g.  X chromosome silencing in females.</p>
<p>Silencing occurs when the meCpG is bound by specific binding proteins (e.g. MeCP1 &amp; 2).  MeCP proteins can cause DNA transcriptional repression, bind to domains,  recruit chromatin condensing proteins, prohibit transcription factor from binding, or alter gene expression.  </p>
<p>In cancer cells we see hypermethylation at CPG islands at the site of the promoters for tumor suppressing genes thus silencing them.  Hypermethylation of CPG island increases as the cancer progresses.  Since  the transcription site is blocked, it is not expressed and the cell is allowed to undergo tumorgenesis.  This epigenentic change is heritable and can be advantageous over other cells, thus naturally selected.  </p>
<p>In intergenic and repetitive elements DNA-methylation supports stability.  In intergenic elements it silences cryptic splice sites and promoters; preventing deletion, insertion, and reciprocal-translocations. In repetitive elements methylation prevents transposition by silencing  and mutating repeats (meC--&gt;T).  Silencing repeats also prevents transcriptional interference from strong promoters and illegitimate recombination.   During cancer interegenic and repetitive elements are repeatedly hypomethylated, decreasing stability.  Previously blocked promoters are no longer methylated allowing incorrect expression.  Additionally, normally only homologous parts of chromosomes can be translocated, but now splicing sites are no longer modified and long repeating unmethylated sequences (due to repetitive nature, which had previously been methylated) seem similar/homologous allowing reciprocal translocation.  The integrity of the DNA is adversely affected causing aberrations and increase in growth, contributing to cancer.</p>
<p>A couple mechanisms have been suggested for these changes in methylation: mutations of epigenetic enzymes, misshapen cells leading to mistargeting of transcription clusters by transcription factories, or oxidative stress.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic changes are passed on to daughter cells during cell division, making them mitotically heritable unless actively deleted.  This is because enzymes such as DNMT1 have an affinity for methylated cytosines and will methylate any hemi-methylated DNA strands they comes across, as in cell division, thus insuring the new strand of DNA is methylated in a complimentary fashion.  Thus although the cancer cell may not have been killed by the medication, its progeny is ultimately changed.  Further epigenetic changes from say other drugs could come together to treat cancer</p>
<p>The sensitive period is when the environment can most likely have an effect on the epigenome and these effects will be passed transgenerationally. Two major periods of epigenetic reprogramming are the early preimplantation and early postimplantations period and primordial germ cell development all the way to the production of mature egg and sperm.  </p>
<p>If a patient’s gametes are still forming (second sensitive period), In addition to affecting cancer cells, DNA methylation targetting drugs could affect germ cells negatively. This isn't advisable for it could be very harmful to any future offspring as there could side effects to the drugs that would also effect them epigenetically.</p></div>
