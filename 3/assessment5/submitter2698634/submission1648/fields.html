    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>CpG islands are often located around the promoters of genes and are usually protected from methylation. DNA methylation at CpG islands result in silencing of gene expression. In cancer, this phenomenon tends to be exacerbated and so CpG islands tend to be hypermethylated. This hypermethylation will cause suppression of gene expression. When these genes are tumor suppressor genes, it creates an imbalance in cell mechanisms such as cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair, leading to cancer. Intergenic regions and repetitive elements are usually methylated. This methylation helps maintaining genomic integrity by protecting the genome from transposable elements. Silencing of repeats prevents transposition, transcriptional interference from strong promoters and abnormal recombination. In cancer, these regions are hypomethylated allowing instability caused by abnormal recombination and transposition of elements.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Igf2 and H19 are “neighbors” that are reciprocally imprinted and so Igf2 expression is silenced at the maternal allele and H19 is silenced at the paternal allele. At the Igf2/H19 imprinting control region there are CTCF binding-sites that mediate the assembly of this insulator protein that blocks the interaction between the Igf2 promoter and the enhancers that are located downstream of the H19 gene. The maternal allele is unmethylated and so this allows CTCF-binding to the imprinting control region (ICR). That connection will silence Igf2 and allow enhancers activity over H19 gene resulting in its expression. The paternal allele is methylated and so that blocks CTCF from binding, which enables methylation spread to H19 promoter. That causes H19 silencing and allows enhancers activity over Igf2 leading to its expression. In Wilm’s tumor, there’s loss of maternal imprinting, leading to biallelic expression leading to Igf2 overexpression and H19 silencing. So, when there’s loss of imprinting at this region it leads to overgrowth and increased risk of tumor development. When there’s hypomethylation, the opposite occurs - Igf2 loss of activity and increased activity of H19 gene. This will cause restriction of growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is an epigenetic drug that belongs to the <em>DNA methyltransferase inhibitors</em> class (DNA-demethylating agents). This drug is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated in DNA during replication. So when DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 binds to the strand so it can copy the methylation to the daughter strand, it becomes irreversibly bound. As this mechanism is replication dependent it will have higher effect on tumor cells as these are constantly replicating. This demethylation will then result in the expression of the previously hypermethylated (and silenced) genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation can have long lasting effects on the epigenome because epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells. These changes are only deleted during cell “reboot” at development, in the next generation. So, sensitive periods are those where there’s active remodeling of the epigenome during cell development. It includes two periods: primordial germ cell development through mature eggs/sperm and preimplantation and postimplantation periods. Treating patients with demethylation drugs for example is unadvisable because it would be useless as this periods are characterized by low methylation levels.</p></div>
