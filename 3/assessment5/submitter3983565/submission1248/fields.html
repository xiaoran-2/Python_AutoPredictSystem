    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the addition of methyl group to  cytosine and its  usually happens in cytosine that located befor guanine,  the sites that have many of this c-g combination calld CPG islands. the <strong>CPG island</strong> is often in the beginning of genes and the result of methylation in the CPG island is silencing the expression of the same gene.                                                                                           </p>
<p>in<strong> a normal cell</strong> the CPG islands  tends to avoid methylation and methylation of some CPG island is differ  by different cell types.                                                                                                                                    </p>
<p> in <strong>cancer cells</strong> the CPG islands are frequently hypermethylation, the hypermethylation includeing at the tumour suppressor gene and  this silencing cause to "promote" cancer, different tumour type have diffrend sets of tumour suppressor CPG island that have been methylation. </p>
<p>the hypermethylation in CPG islands cause silencing of many critical genes each of this genes encoder to some kind of protin with necessary of specific action or process and this lack of specific protin cause certain disease for example diabetes can by cause by  mutation in the insulin gene but also by silencing the expression of the same gene mainning methylation in the CPG island of insulin gene. in addition methylation in CPG can cause mutation in the DNA because c-me can become t  and this mutation can lead to difrent disorders.</p>
<p>the<strong> intergenic regions</strong> and<strong> repetitive elements</strong> are usually methylated in <strong>normal cells</strong> and this is necessary for genomic stabillity   </p>
<p>in <strong>cancer cells</strong> the intergenic regions and repetitive elements are frequently hypometlyted  and this leads to genomic instability as deletions reciprocal translocations insertions, mutations and diseases</p>
<p>hypomethylayion in this  intergenic regions leads to expression of helf gene or two genes togeder and like i said genomic instability  and when the repetitive is not silenc they can be deadly because they can "jump" on the DNA and destroy genes and they have astrong promoter so they can also activete genes that supuest to be silenc.   </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>imprint genes is when there is some rule in the expression of paternal and maternal alleles ,in most cases the imprint genes related to growth and keep balance in every cell. cancer cells loss the imprinting by hyper/hypo-methylation in the ICR.</p>
<p> <strong>normal cell                                                                                                                                              </strong>in the case of  H19/IGF2 cluster , before the ICR there is gene for IGF2(promote growt) and affter the ICR there is gene H19                                                                                                                                in the<strong> paternal</strong> allele this ICR is methlyted and its spread to the promoter of H19 and by that silenc the H19 gene and the igf2 is active and increased expression because of the ehhancers that located kb forward.<strong> H19-,IGF2 +                                                                                                                            </strong>in the <strong>maternal</strong> allele this ICR is not methylated and bind to CTCF this protin prevent the ehhancers to incres igf2 and lead to silenc igf2  the ehhancers "compromise" and incresd expression of H19   <strong>h19+ , igf2-  </strong> by that you can see the balance in every cell between this to protin.  </p>
<p>one of cancer cells character is evading growt suppressors and over expression of growt promoter and  in <strong>wilms tumour</strong> both alleles behave like the patrnal allele because of the hypermethylation at the ICR and it lead to over dosage of the igf2 which promote growt. the disruptinf at cluster cause over dosage of igf2 and change the cell balence.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>decitabine is <strong>inhibitor</strong> histon deacetlylas in other words it prevent the removeing of the histon acetylation or prevent the funxion of histon deacetyltransferasees.</p>
<p>decitabine cause to <strong>hypomethylation</strong> by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase and by that prevent DNA methylation.</p>
<p> ,one of the effect in cancer is hypermethylation in CPG island that cause cilencing of tumour suppressor genes(among others results) and in ICR that cause to chages in growt so this funxion of the drug that lower that methylation and cause hypometylation can reactivet this tumour suppressor gene and return the imprinting of the growt gene and by that the growt suppressors</p>
<p>and in addition it is also inhibitor of histon deacetlyas, histon acetylation is an active mark and result in activion of genes so again those gene that turn silenc incloding tumour suppressor can return active because its preventind deaceetlylas.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>dna methylation</strong> is a stable epigentic mark which is passed on to subsequent cell generations in other words it is mitotic inerited. so if you altering the methylation in some cells they will pase on this changes to daughter cells. </p>
<p><strong>sensitive period</strong> is times in develpment that the epigentic is reprograming maining most of epigentic marks comes off and reestablish the reasion it is sencitive is that every chang of envierment or chimical or urging this process can effect the reestablish of this epigentic markes and can be deadly because epigentic markes have huge effect on genome expression and regulation. there is two sensetive period:  one is the <strong>pre implantation/ early development</strong> which is last from the zygota through the blastocyst  the secone period is<strong> primordial germ cell development </strong> .the reason this sensetive prosses most happen is because the primordial germ cell are very diffrent from stem cell in structure and funxion so they have difrent epigentic marks.</p>
<p><strong>treating patients</strong> during this periods is very dangerous becuse most of the treathing incloding drugs and chimical matter and those can have effect on the reastablish of the epigentic marks and can cuse alot of disorders and epimutation.</p></div>
