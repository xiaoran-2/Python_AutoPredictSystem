    <div class="field-value"><p>In many cancers, the epigenetic alteration of DNA methylation rivals genetic mutations in frequency. Both regional, locus-specific DNA hypermethylation and global, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation effects are often seen.</p>
<p>Normally, the CpG islands near gene promoter regions are unmethylated and exhibit an open, euchromatin structure.  In cancer, the CpG islands and shores (2K base pairs upstream and 2K base pairs downstream) become hypermethylated.  Hypermethylation of the CpG islands blocks the expression of the associated gene.  With respect to cancer, hypermethylation causes serious problems at loci containing tumor-suppressor genes and at imprint control regions (ICRs).  By blocking expression, the normal cellular safeguards are disabled.  In these situations, DNA methylation is especially troubling since this epigenetic mark is mitotically heritable and the uncontrolled growth of cancer exhibits rapid positive selection.</p>
<p>In a manner inversely reciprocal to DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, cancerous cells display DNA hypomethylation at intergenic regions and repetitive elements.  Normally, these repeats and intergenic regions display high levels of methylation along with a closed, heterochromatin structure. The purpose of this epigenetic state is assumed to promote genomic stability.  In cancer, the repeats and intergenic regions become hypomethylated leading to genomic instability.  The defects caused by this instability include illegitimate recombination between repeats, activation of repeats and transposition, and chromosomal effects including deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is currently marketed for the treatment of myelogenous leukemia.  It is in a class of epigenetic drugs known as DNA methylation inhibitors.  Alternatively, these type of drugs are known as DNA-demethylating agents.</p>
<p>In cancers such as this, tumor-suppressor genes are inappropriately repressed allowing uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.  Tumor-suppressor genes would have an anti-tumor effect if normally expressed.</p>
<p>In these type of cancers, the CpG island associated with the promoter region becomes hyper-methylated and therefore silences the tumor-suppressor gene.</p>
<p>Decitabine inhibits the DNA methylation of this CpG island by targeting the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Drugs that alter DNA methylation have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment.  This is because DNA methylation status is passed on during cell division (mitosis) to daughter cells.  Therefore, these drugs induce changes to the epigenome that persist even when the drug is no longer taken.</p>
<p>Research studies have shown DNA methylation produces stable epigenetic marks.  During the process of mitosis,  the enzyme De Novo Methyl Transferase (DNMT1) maintains the existing DNA methylation pattern by copying the marks to the newly formed sister chromatids.</p>
<p>The epigenome normally controls organismal development in critical processes such as cell differentiation.  The epigenome experiences "sensitive periods" where the epigenetic state is erased and re-established during early embryonic development and the maturation of germ cells.  Therefore, it is advisable that caution be used when administering epigenetic drugs to pre-pubescent adolescents and pregnant women.  Epigenetic drugs could deleteriously alter the epigenome required for normal development during these "sensitive periods".</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprinting of alleles is an important mechanism to regulate growth.  By allowing only one of the parental alleles to be expressed, proper gene dosage is achieved via imprinting.</p>
<p>Wilm's tumour is a result of imprinting distruption at the H19/Igf2 cluster.  Normally, the action of "enhancer blocking" at this cluster only allows the maternal H19 allele to be expressed and only the paternal Igf2 allele to be expressed.</p>
<p>In the paternal allele, the imprint control region (ICR) is methylated and blocks the binding of CTCF, an insulator protein.  Without CTCF, DNA methylation spreads to silence the H19 promoter and downstream enhancers are able to activate the paternal Igf2 allele.</p>
<p>Normally, the maternal ICR is unmethylated, allowing the CTCF insulator to bind.  The enhancer is blocked from acting upstream to activate the maternal Igf2.  Instead, the enhancer activates the maternal H19.</p>
<p>In Wilm's tumour, the maternal ICR becomes abnormally hypermethylated.  This leads to a state exactly like the paternal allele described above.  In this situation, the maternal H19 is silenced and the maternal Igf2 is activated.</p>
<p>Since the dosage of Igf2 is abnormally doubled, this strongly growth-oriented gene epigenetically promotes cancer.</p>
