    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one epigenetic fact wich occurs normaly at the genome in specific places as CpG dinucleotides. It occurs when a methyl group binds to Cytosine. As long as this is an epigenetic fact, it is maintain through cell division by the enzime DNMT1, and it could be changed or removed in cancer therapy.</p>
<p>CpGs could be near and together forming CpG islands along the genome. In normal cells, these CpG islands tend to be demethylated. In cancer cells it is found that CpG islands are hypermethylated and if they are near to the promotor of tumor suppressor genes, it can result in silencing of the gene and carry to cancer expression of oncogenes.  </p>
<p>Along the genome there are intergenic regions and repetitive elements wich in a normal cell tend to be hypermethylated and this brings genome stability because cromatin tends to be more packaged and compact. In cancer cells it is found hypomethylation of the repetitive elements and intergenic regions, and that is associated with open cromatin (euchromatin) instead of heterocromatin where DNA is densely packaged. This hypomethylated repeats can be activated, as long as they have the capacity to make copies of themselves, so they can jump into another areas of the genome resulting in changes along the chromosome. Theses changes alter the genomic stability and they result in deletions, translocations, etc.        </p>
<p>It is possible to use hypermethylation and hypomethylation markers in order to make diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring and treatment of cancer, and have been great advances in that field. </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Imprint Control Regions are regions in the genome in wich certain genes can be expressed in order to get normal development. These regions are associated with genes involved in growth (promoting or suppressing). Hypermethylation or hipomethylation of theses regions can carry a disruption of imprinting and it can contribute to cancer expression, as it's seen in H19/Igf2 cluster hypermethilation.</p>
<p>In normal cells, paternal allele has its ICR methylated, there is no CTCF (insulator element) bind to ICR, and enhancers can access to Igf2 to activate it.    In maternal allele, ICR is unmethylated and bound to CTCF, so enhancers are able to act over H19, but CTCF bind to maternal ICR unmethylated and insulates Igf2 from enhancers.</p>
<p>However, In cancer as in Wilm's tomour, it is found that  maternal ICR is methylated, wich carry to Igf2 expression. That is because genes don't display monoallelic parent-of-origin-specific expression, they become either expressed from both parental alleles and it contributes to disease. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine (5-aza-2′-desoxicitidina) is a pyrimidine analog, so it takes Cytosine places when is incorporated in to the DNA. It is an hypomethilating agent because it blocks DNA methyltransferase (DNMTs) by an irreversible bound. It is know that epigenetic hypermethylation causes silencing of tumor suppresor genes.  It has been found that at low doses, Decitabine causes hipomethylation of genetic promoter, and reactivation of tumour suppressor genes. </p>
<p>Besides, MDR-1 gene encodes for drug resistance, and  Decitabine decrese expression or MDR-1 gene by causing demethylation of the repressor binding site of MDR-1 gene.</p>
<p>It has been used in mielodisplasic syndromes because it causes reativation of tumour suppresor genes, and induces celular differentiation and apoptosis (programmed cell death) </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>We don't know exactly how epigenetic drugs can have enduring effects on the epigenome. There is lack of specificity inheret to their mechanism of action.   There are some sensitive periods in human development in wich the enviroment may influence epigenetic makeup. These periods are during primordial germ cell development and during the production of mature eggs and sperms. During these periods there's an active remodelling of the epigenome. Any insult to epigenomic machinery during these periods could cause undetermined abnormalities.  That is why is inadvisable to give hypomethylating agents during sensitive periods, because of their undesireble and unknown effects.</p>
<p>As long as epigenetic drugs causes changes in the epigenetic DNA methylation, it is possible to infer that there will be effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment, and these long term effects could explain that tumor cells become more susceptible to standar chamotherapy. </p></div>
