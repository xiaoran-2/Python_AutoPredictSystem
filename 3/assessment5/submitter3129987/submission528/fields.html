    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.
In your answer include the following points:
<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of

    <div class="field-value"><p>The location of CpG islands in the genome have been associated with promoter regions (found in 60% of promoters) that in normal cells are mostly unmethylated independent of their activity state. In contrast, CpG islands tend to become hypermethylated in cancer cell promoters, which then leads to gene silencing. Often these genes encode for tumor suppressors whose silencing contributes to tumor formation. In normal cells, DNA is highly methylated in intergenic regions and repetitive elements, which keeps the genome integrity by blocking unwanted recombination events and establishing the formation of heterochromatin and gene imprints. When global methylation patterns change, that is, large regions become hypomethylated as is the case in cancer cells, genome becomes increasingly unstable.The loss of heterochromatin leads to improper chromosome segregation and thereby aneuploidity of cancer cells; transposable repeat elements are free to move to places where they disrupt normal gene expression in cancer cells, and global hypomethylation of intergenic regions affects overall gene regulation network specific for a particular tissue contributing to disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19 and Igf2 are neighbouring genes separated by an imprint control region (ICR). The ICR of paternal allele is methylated, which blocks the binding of a transcriptional repressor protein (CTCF) allowing the downstream enhancer to act upon upstream Igf2 promoter and activate its expression. The ICR of maternal allele is unmethylated, CTCF can bind it, whereby the effect of downstream enhancer on Igf2 expression is blocked, and instead H19 is expressed. Cells express double dose of growth promoting factor Igf2 in the case of Wilm’s tumour, because maternal allele of H19/Igf2 cluster also becomes methylated.       </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methyltransferase (DMT) inhibitor that leads to DNA hypomethylation. In cancer, promoters of certain genes including tumor suppressor genes become hypermethylated leading to gene silencing and enhanced cell growth. DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification and is passed on during cell division to daughter cells, hence the unmethylating effect of Decitabine spreads in cancer cells, finally erasing the methylation in the promoter of a tumor suppressor and leading to controlled cell growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification and is passed on during cell division to daughter cells. That is, the DNA methylation patterns in the original cell are retained in its progeny. Epigenetic reprogramming, that is global reorganization of epigenetic marks in chromatin takes place during sensitive periods of development that include primordial germ cell (PGC) and embryonic development. During sensitive periods, genomes are most susceptible to epigenetic alterations. Treating patients with epigenetic drugs during those periods blocks normal development by disrupting the establishment of gene imprints, cell type-specific chromatin modification patterns and proper chromatin structure.</p></div>
