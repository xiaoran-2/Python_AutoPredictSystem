    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications which is involved in the regulation of gene expression. In the genome of an organism there is an specific pattern of methylation, which is involved  in the spatio-temporal expression of that particular gene and hence maintains homeostasis in the cell. Altered methylation pattern can be harmful to the cell and might lead to the cancer. In a normal cell genome is hypomethylated at CpG islands and hypermethylated in intergenic and repititive elements where as in cancer cell the situation reverses.</p>
<p>CpG islands are generally present in the promoter regions of the genes and since they are hypomethylated (that is,open chromatin), they promote the transcription of the genes to form proteins or non coding RNAs and perform normal function in the cell, where as intergenic and repititive elements are generally hypermethlated and which results into condensed chromatin and hence reduces the chances of recombination between non homologous chromosomes and hence increase genomic stability. But in a cancerous cell the situation reverses as said earlier. Hypomethylation of intergenic regions and repititive elements leads to open chromatin formation, more chances of recombination with different chromosomes and hence results in formation of faulty genomic complement.</p>
<p>Another important aspect in cancer formation is tumor suppressor and activator genes. There is a fine interbalance in the expression of these genes in the normal cells, whereas it has been seen in cancerous cells there is an altered expression of these genes. This observations can easily be explained by the changes in the overall genome methylation pattern of normal and cancerous cells as said above if tumor supressor gene is switched off and activator genes (c-myc) are on then it may lead to the cancer. Hence, DNA methylation plays an important role in cancer development.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>H19/Igf2 cluster is present on chromosome number 11. Inside the cluster there is an imprint control region (ICR) which can be either methylated and unmethylated. In this case, the maternal allele is unmethylated whereas the paternal allele is methylated hence it is paternally imprinted. Since, the maternal allele is unmethylated so it can be bound by CTCF (insulator protein) which insulates the Igf2 promoter from the downstream enhancer. So these enhancer are free to act on H19 and enhances its expression on maternal allele. While in case of paternal allele its opposite happens, since enhancers are free bind to Igf2 promoters they increase Igf2 production which is involved in cell growth.</p>
<p>In wilm's tumor, there is a methylation of the maternal allele as a result it starts to behave like a paternal chromosome. It causes the downstream enhancer to bind to the Igf2 promoter and hence the total amount of the Igf2 product becomes double. Since it causes the cell growth as a result the cells grow abnormally and lead to the tumor formation. It might occur due to the faulty formation of methylation marks during the epigenetic programming of the cell. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA methylation enzyme inhibitor. So these inhibitors decrease the level of methylation in the genome. The cellular DNA methyltransferases are involved in the transfer of  methyl group, which in turn make epigenetic changes and alters gene expression which might lead to cancer. So by the use of dectabine which is an nucleotide homologue binds to the active sites of the DNA methyl transferases and renders them in active. So this may prevent the methylation of tumor suppressor genes and rendering them to be transcriptionally active. Since it is cancerous cell which divide very fastly so they are the ones which are effected the most. But one thing should be taken care of while using these drugs to treat cancer, they are to be used in context dependent manner. A specific type of tumor is to be treated with a specific drug and there is no universnality.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Since the epigenome of the cell can be reveresed so it is better to treat the cancer/ tumor by using the epigenetic drugs rather than chemotherapy.Since DNA methylation is been involved in the the change in gene expression (proto oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes) and in genome stability, so targetting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT's) in the treatment of the tumor is of prime importance. recent data also states that by using the epigenetic modifier drugs against DNMT's can help in the improvements of the patients. Use of these drugs in the sensitive periods ( Where there is an influence of the environment on the system) can play a major role in the reversal of the tumor cell into a normal cell. since old epigenetic marks are cleared and the new are laid.</p></div>
