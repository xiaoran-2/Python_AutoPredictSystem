    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation shows abberant patterns in cancer.</p>
<p>DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group by de novo methyltransferases to the 5´end of the cytosine in the CpG dinucleotides, and is maintained by DMNT1.</p>
<p>CpG clusters are called CpG islands. CpG islands generally are located at the promoter region of the gene (the place where the transcription machinery binds). Methylation of CpG islands lead to gene silencing. Methyl groups recruit protein complexes and deacetylases that densely package the chromatin and therefore transcription can´t ocurr and gene expression is silenced.</p>
<p>CpG Islands tend to be protected from methylation. In normal cells, CpG islands are generally hypomethylated, they are expressed. </p>
<p>CpG islands in cancer cells show an aberrant pattern of hypermethylation which silences their gene expression. This specially ocurrs in the CpG islands located in tumor suppresor genes (genes involved in apoptosis or that decrease the proliferation of cells), which are deactivated and then tumorogenesis may ocurr. Tumor suppresor genes with hypermethylated CpG islands behave in the same way as a genetically mutated gene.</p>
<p>In normal cells Intergenic regions, introns  and repetitive elements are usually methylated, they are turned off. One of the functions of DNA methylation is to maintain genomic stability (protects against transposable elements) by repeat silencing, it prevents illegitimate deletions, insertions, reciprocal translocations, duplication or loss of chromosomes. </p>
<p>In cancer these regions are unmethylated, repeats are active and make copies of themselves wrongly attaching to parts of the gene, leading to transcriptional mistakes and genomic disruption in the surrounding regions.</p>
<p>All of these aberrant DNA methylation patterns lead to activation (overexpresion) of oncogenes (genes involved in growth promotion: inmmortality of cell),inactivation of tumor suppresors and division of repetitive elements. Each of these aberrant patterns in DNA methylation constitute epimutations hits that contribute to cancer onset.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>On the paternal allele, ICR methylation stops binding of CTCF. CTCF acts as an insulator protein from enhancer activity.  With no CTCF protein present, enhancers are free to act on Igf2 (oncogene,growth promotor gene), and this gene is expressed.</p>
<p>On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to the unmethylated ICR, where it insulates Igf2 from the downstream enhancers. With no action from the downstream  enhancers, Igf2 gene expression is silenced.</p>
<p>In a normal cell, then Igf2 is paternally expressed and maternally silenced. </p>
<p>Mutations, deletions or epigenetic disruptions can cause the loss of imprinting. In Wilm´s tumour, loss of imprinting of the Ifg2 gene ocurrs. This loss of imprinting makes both alleles behave like the paternal alleles. When both alleles behave as paternal, Igf2 is overexpressed, leading to an uncontrolled cell growth and to the formation of tumours like Wilm´s in kidney.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine belongs to the epigenetic inhibitor class called DNA demethylating agents.</p>
<p>It acts as a DMNT (DNA methyltransferase) inhibitor.</p>
<p>In the presence of decitabine cells incorporate it do DNA during replication as a nucleoside analog. The incorporation of decitabine in DNA irreversibly binds DMNT and it is therefore no longer released, then DMT cant do its work and copy the methylation on the daughter strand, and therefore causes demethylation in that sequence.</p>
<p>Demethylation with decitabine can induce the normal function of genes that are aberrantly silenced in cancer, like genes which cause growth arrest (tumor suppresors) and apoptosis (cell death) in tumor cells. It thus has an antineoplastic(anti-tumour) effect. Cancer cells which divide more rapidily than other cells in the body will be mostly affected by decitabine because they are replicating more.</p>
<p>The good thing about decitabine is that non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to it. </p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alteration of DNA methylation with drugs can have effects beyond the period of treatment by 1. mitosis, the change in methylation is transmited to the daughter cells upon replication and 2. by meiosis, the change is transmitted epigenetically via the gametes to the offspring (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance).</p>
<p>The epigenome is more vulnerable to environment during the sensitive periods of development. The sensitive periods in mammals are</p>
<p>during the primordial germ cell development through the production of mature eggs and sperm, and the second sensitive period is the period of pre-implantation and post-implantation of the embryo. Both these periods are periods of active remodelling of the epigenome.</p>
<p>Treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable. You can´t treat a pregnant mother with decitabine since the fetus, undergoing his sensitive periods would have birth defects with the changes in methylation(due to changes in gene expression)  or not be born at all. Also men and women shouldnt concieve during the use of decitabine, he may epigenetically transmit the changes of methylation in his DNA via his sperm to the fetus or she via her eggs. </p></div>
