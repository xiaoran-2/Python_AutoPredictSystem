    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, CpG islands are unmethylated leading to the activation of the tumour suppressor gene. However, in an aberrant cancer cell, you can see that hypermethylation of the CpG islands leading to the silencing of tumour suppressor genes. Tumour suppressor genes normally serve to stop cells from dividing. When this function is turned off, the cell no longer has any “brakes” to inhibit its growth. Following this, more mutations develop as well as more problems. DNA methylation is also one of the first of at least two “hits” necessary to lead to the completion of the Knudson hypothesis. The Knduson hypothesis states that cancer is the result of multiple hits to DNA. DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands makes the gene primed for another attack and increases the likelihood of potential cancer. In the intergenic regions and repetitive elements of a normal functioning cell, there is methylation. This means that this portion is effectively silenced in normal cells. In cancer cells the opposite is true. The intergenic regions and repetitive elements are hypomethylated. They are not silenced. This allows the intergenic regions which contain promoters and enhancers to become active. These newly active promoters and enhancers in turn effect the repetitive elements by allowing them to become active and transpose within other places in the gene, causing further mutation and thus increasing the likelihood of cancer in the individual.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The disruption of imprinting can lead to cancer in many ways. Imprinted genes that should be showing mono-allelic parent of origin specific expression now either show expression from both parental alleles or are silenced from both. The change in the methylation pattern of Imprint Control Regions (ICR) can cause growth in one of two ways. Either the growth promoting genes become overexpressed or the growth suppressing genes become underexpressed. First we must consider the methylation pattern of the paternal allele in a normal cell. On the paternal allele, there is methylation of the ICR and this causes the paternal enhancers to act on Igf2 and there is no binding of CTCF to the ICR and Igf2 is expressed. On the maternal allele, the ICR is unmethylated and this allows an insulator called CTCF to bind allowing the enhancers to act on H19 and Igf2 will be silent and unexpressed. In loss of imprinting, there is hypermethylation on both alleles. Therefore on the maternal allele, there is expression of Igf2. This gives the cell a double dose of the growth promoting factor, Igf2, in Wilm’s tumour compared to a normal cell.  This increased growth contributes to the disease.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA- demethylating agent that can treat myelodysplastic syndromes. By demethylating genes that have traditionally been silenced through DNA- methylation, tumour suppressor genes that have been silenced can now be active again. These genes can stop the unwarranted growth of cells. These changes can be inherited by all the daughter cells because these changes are inherited mitotically. When tumour suppressor genes are activated or when other genes that suppress tumours are not in heterochromatin these genes can be expressed and decrease the chances of tumours forming. With both the activation of tumour suppressor genes and inheritance of these changes by the daughter cells, there is a notable anti-tumour effect that can last the lifetime of the organism.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The most exciting thing about epigenetic treatment of tumours is that epimutations can be reversed. Another aspect of epimutations that can be manipulated for our benefit is that they are mitotically inherited. This means that when the epimutations are reversed, this new epigenome will be inherited by all the daughter cells and the epigenome will not revert back to its old state. These effects will last long after the period of drug administration to the patient. You should not administer drugs during the sensitive period. The sensitive periods are characterized by an ability of the environment to have an effect on epigenetic control. The sensitive periods are periods in which the epigenetic marks are getting actively remodelled. There are two sensitive periods of development. The first is the period of primordial germ cell development to mature gametes. The second is pre-implantation to early post-implantation. Treating patients during sensitive periods would be dangerous because these changes could be inherited in future generations because the germ cells are being developed in this time period as well. </p></div>
