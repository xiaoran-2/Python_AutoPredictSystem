    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">In a normal cell, CpG islands (CGIs) generally are not methylated. When they are methylated, they tend to be associated with gene silencing.</p>
<p class="p1">All cancer tumors that we have studied show hypermethylation of specific CGIs, groups of CGIs, or shores of CGIs. This is called an epimutation. CGI methylation is mitotically heritable, so once it occurs, daughter cells also have these epigenetic marks.</p>
<p class="p1">The hypermethylation associated with CGIs silences tumor suppressor genes. This is considered a "hit" in the Knudson hypothesis (that cancer arises only after multiple events that damage a cell's genome or epigenome). </p>
<p class="p1">Tumor suppressor genes prevent cells from dividing out of control. So when they are turned off, a cell is free to make more copies of itself. As a result, these cells are selected for—that is, they quickly outnumber normal cells and gain a competitive advantage.</p>
<p class="p1">Hypermethylation that silences tumor suppressor genes occurs more often in cancer than mutations to the genes themselves. The specific location of the hypermethylation (the DNA methylation profile) depends on the type of tumor. CGI hypermethylation and tumor suppressor silencing increases as cancer progresses. (And also with age.)</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">In a normal cell, DNA is often methylated in intergeneic regions and at repetitive elements, which prevents this DNA from being expressed. Silencing this DNA promotes genomic stability.</p>
<p class="p1">In all forms of cancer studied so far, repeats and intergenic regions are hypomethylated and become available for transcription. This usually happens early in the development of the cancer and increases as the cancer progresses.  </p>
<p class="p1">Hypomethylation disrupts genomic instability. When repeats are not silenced, they can recombine, make copies of themselves, insert themselves in different parts of a chromosome, and engage in reciprocal transposition (jump to other chromosomes). They can also turn on genes that are normally silenced.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">In genomic imprinting, the allele from a specific parent is expressed. These genes occur in clusters, each with an imprint control region (ICR).  </p>
<p class="p1">Imprinted clusters often have to do with growth and growth suppression. Loss of imprinting can result in overgrowth. Loss of imprinting is seen in many types of cancer.</p>
<p class="p1">The H19/Igf2 cluster is an imprinted gene cluster. H19 limits growth by limiting expression of Igf2, an oncogene (growth promoting gene).</p>
<p class="p1">In a normal cell, H19 is expressed from the maternal allele and Igf2 is expressed from the paternal allele. The ICR on the maternal allele is unmethylated. This allows the CTCF insulator protein to bind. CTCF prevents downstream enhancers from acting on Igf2. The enhancers act on H19 instead. </p>
<p class="p1">The paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which prevents CTCF from binding. The enhancers now act on Igf2.  </p>
<p class="p1">Loss of imprinting causes the ICR on the maternal allele to be methylated. This prevents CTCF from binding and limiting expression of Igf2. Furthermore Igf2 is now expressed from both alleles. The result is overgrowth. One result is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is associated with embryonic or childhood tumors, including Wilm's tumor, which occurs in the kidney.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">Decitabine belongs to a class of drugs that target epigenetic machinery called small molecule inhibitors or enzyme inhibitors. Decitabine belongs to the subset of this class called DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT inhibitors). </p>
<p class="p1">DNA methyltransferase is an enzyme that helps lay down methylation on DNA. One of the functions of DNA methylation in a cell is to silence genes and non-gene parts of the DNA that are not being used by that line of cells. In some cancers, the methylation process is disrupted, and there is excessive (hyper) methylation of the DNA in which tumor suppressor genes that limit cell growth are silenced.</p>
<p class="p1">Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. It is incorporated into the DNA during cell replication and permanently binds DNMT. This causes hypomethylation of the DNA. </p>
<p class="p1">Decitabine may prevent tumors by reversing the silencing via methylation of tumor suppressor genes.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p class="p1">During most of its life, an organism is in somatic maintenance: DNA methylation has been laid down in the cells of most tissues, and these epigenetic marks are inherited by daughter cells, so the epigenome is stable in most cell lines. </p>
<p class="p1">Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed (cleared and laid down) during certain periods of an organism's development. These are known as sensitive periods because this process requires a stable environment. During these periods, inadequate supplies of the chemicals needed for DNA methylation, or other disruptions, can cause death or lead to serious health problems in the offspring. </p>
<p class="p1">The sensitive periods are early post-implantation (the zygote/blastocyst stage), primordial germ cell development (mid-gestation embryo stage), and production of mature eggs and sperm (adult). Females produce mature eggs just before conception, so pre-implantation is also a sensitive period.</p>
<p class="p1">Epigenetic drugs are capable of changing the epigenetic marks in a cell. These changes are inherited by the daughter cells. These drugs usually enter all cells, not just cancerous ones, and often cause hypomethylation. Hypomethylation in a cell during its sensitive period could inhibit its epigenetic machinery. Treatment with epigenetic drugs could therefore cause damage in early pregnancy or in gametes.</p></div>
