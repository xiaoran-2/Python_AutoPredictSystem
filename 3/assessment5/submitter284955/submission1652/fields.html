    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation (adding a methyl group on the 5C position of the cytosine base)­ is one of the few epigenetic mechanisms that results with blocking the gene expression and creating the silent heterochromatin. In a normal cell DNA methylation is present in approximately 70–80% of the CpG dinucleotides in somatic mammalian cells, but some of the CpG islands are not methylated and they are found in 60 % of the promoters. In a cancer cell this situation is different, CpG islands are hypermethylated. This results with silencing a lot of genes including the tumor suppressor genes that control normal cell growth. This causes genomic instability and deregulation of the normal cell cycle and creating a cancer tissue.</p>
<p>Actually, the global level of DNA methylation in a normal cell decreases as the cell progresses into a hyperplasia and neoplasia, but the level of DNA methylation on CpG islands on some of the promoters increases. </p>
<p>In a normal cell intergenic regions such as repetitive sequences and remainings of retroviral transposons are methylated which  means they are silenced, but in cancer cells they are hypomethylated which means they are active. This activation can cause genomic instability like abnormal recombination between repeats, transposition of repeats, activating neighboring gene promoters etc. Abnormal recombination can occur between long repeats that have identical or similar DNA sequences in different regions of the genome that are not silenced with methylation, because in normal cells these repeats are methylated and condensed which makes them heterchromatonized and for recombination to occur normally we need  open chromatin. Repeats that are not methylated can make copies of themselves and these copies can jump in different regions of the genome and insert in other gene sequences disrupting it’s normal function. All these changes cause mutations that contributes to creating a cancer tissue.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a member of a new class of drugs known as DNA "demethylating" agents  sold as Dacogen by Eisai, a Japanese company, and it’s used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</p>
<p>We know that DNA methylation is epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression in cell. In tumor cells we have increased DNA methylation, this increased methylation causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes that regulate cell division and growth.</p>
<p>The way that this drug works is by direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, causing hypomethylation of DNA.</p>
<p>With this process of demethylation, the normal function of the tumor suppressor genes will be  restored and this will result with gaining control over normal cell growth again.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There are some scientific data that provide evidence that environment  can influence epigenetic control and also it opens the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. This means that not only genetic information can be inherited from the parents to the offspring, but also epigenetic marks. But, altered environment at any stage of development doen’t result in a different epigenetic outcome. This can only occur in the sensitive periods, and they’re periods of active remodelling of the epigenome. There are two periods of epigenetic reprogramming throughout the genome, first is the period of primordial germ cell development all the way through to the production of mature eggs and sperms and the second sensitive period is the pre-implanted and early post-implantation period. In the active period of reprogramming all the epigenic marks, including DNA methylation, are removed and than reestablished again. So, if we use drugs that blocks DNA metylation in these sensitive periods we can cause incomplete recombination in the germ cells that can have serious results in the offspring of the treated patient. So, pregnant women or men and women that plan to have children, should avoid this kind of drugs, also can be avoided from preadolescent or adolescent children.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Aberrant imprinting of the <em>lgf2</em> gene plays a significant role in pathogenesis of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome as well as various human cancers including Wilms tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, hepatoblastoma, colorectal and breast carcinomas.</p>
<p>H19/lgf2 clusters typically contain genes that are expressed only from the maternally or paternally-inherited chromosomes. Each of these clusters is under the control of a region, named imprinting control region (ICR). The imprinted control region it's unmethylated on the maternal allele, and methylated on the paternal allele, and this means it's paternally imprinted. On the maternal allele the ICR remains unmethylated allowing CTCF (insulator protein) to bind. This interaction mediates enhancer blocking allowing downstream enhancers to access the H19 promoter. Paternal methylation at the ICR prevents CTCF binding and together with methylation at the H19 promoter allows the enhancers to access Igf2.</p>
<p>What Igf2 does is it promotes growth, it's an oncogene and because of epigenetic disruption it may occur loss of DNA methylation imprints that will result with up regulation, overexpression of lgf2 gene. So if you have no Cdkn1c (tumor suppressor) expression and up regulation of IGF2 in other words in it's overall you're growth promoting.</p></div>
