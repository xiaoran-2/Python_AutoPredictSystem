    <div class="field-name" id="d6002606a5ec3d03">Q1. Describe how DNA methylation is altered in cancer.

<br><p></p><ul><li>Describe the normal
function of DNA methylation at CpG islands.<br></li><li>Describe how DNA
methylation of CpG islands is disrupted in cancer.<br></li><li>Explain how disruption of
DNA methylation at CpG islands contributes to cancer.<br></li><li>Describe the normal

cancer.<br></li></ul><p></p></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is an alternative to genetic mutation, to silence tumour suppressor genes in cancer.Tumour suppressor hypermethylation is often more frequent than mutations. The DNA methylation control the expresion of severel genes that can cause cancer. Alterations in DNA methylation at ICRs (hypo or hypermethylation), can result in loss of expression of growth restricting genes, overexpression of growth promoting genes. This events generate a genomic instability tha can promote the activation of repeats and transposons, activation or disruption of neighbouring genes and illegitimate recombination between repeats .</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In a normal cell, there are two alleles the patternal imprinting is methylated but in the maternal allele is unmethylated so CTCF 4 bind that is an insulator element that it means that the enhancers act on the H19 gene and Igf2 will be silent. In the patternal allele the enhancers will act on Igf2 because CTCF is not binding to the imprinting area.</p>
<p>However, in a cancer cell, with loss of imprinting and what happened is you have high permethylation of the imprint control region on the maternal allele as well. Now, on the matternal allele, you also have expression of Igf2. So now it has a double dose of Igf2 in comparasion of a normal cell. And Igf2 is a growth promoting and this is associatted with Wilm´s tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Decitabine is a DNA-demethylating agent that it has an anti-neoplastic effect because it can reduce the hypermethylation of ICRs.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the epigenome because this drugs are division dependents. So this means that cancer cells which are dividing much more rapidly than most other cells in the body will be more severy affected because they are replicating more.</p>
<p>If we target multiple components of the epigenetic machiniery that go wrong in cancer, we can have a more effective outcome. And then combining these drugs with standard chemotherapy. The drugs has to be used only in the moment of hematological malignancies.</p>
<p>A sensitive period, it is a period of time where it is not recommended for taking these pills because it could inhibit the epigenetic machinery. Younger patients are in a sensitive period of time, particulary those that have developing germ cells.</p></div>
