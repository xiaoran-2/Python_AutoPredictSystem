    <div class="field-value"><p>DNA methylation is the post replicational modification of human genome, attachment of methy at C5 of cytosine . DNA methylation is the basis for different epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, X chromosome inactivation or the formation of heterochromatin. DNA methylation of promoter regions at which most of CpG island situated is inversely correlates with gene expression. In normal cell, CpG island at promoter region is hypomenthylated to express the gene and, intergenic regions, introns and repeatitive elements are hypermethylated to suppresse the expression of these genes to prevent antisense replication. In cancer cell, promoter cpG island tends to become hypermethylated and silence the gene especially the tumor suppressor gene. The DNA methylation of tumor suppressor gene is more frequent than the mutation of these gene. Tumor suppressor gene expresses of tumor suppressor protein which is a cell cycle control protein. The hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene causes the reduced expression of protein and inhibit the cell cycle control and cause the cancer. And also the intergenic region and repeatitive elements are hypomethylated and cause the expression of these genes and cause the cancer.The epigenome of cancer cells displays numerous alterations in comparison to the epigenome of their normal counterpart. Changes in DNA methylation include a genome-wide loss and a regional gain of DNA methylation. This causes on one hand genomic instability and deregulation of tissue specific and imprinted genes and on the other hand silencing of tumor suppressor genes controlling cell cycle, apoptosis or DNA repair by hypermethylation of their promoter CpG islands. Interestingly, no global hypomethylation but rather a directed hypomethylation at satellite repeats could be detected in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors using a genome-wide approach. These defined alterations are currently evaluated for their use as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and response prediction for different cancers.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In normal cell, some genes are mono allelic parental expression. The insulator model of imprinting is employed by the H19/Igf2 imprinted locus. The maternally-expressed H19 gene and paternally-expressed Igf2 gene share enhancers and their reciprocal imprinting is governed by a CTCF-dependent insulator located between the genes. On the maternal allele, CTCF binds to 4 binding sites within the ICR, generating an insulator that prevents Igf2 from accessing the shared enhancers that are located on the H19 side of the insulator. Thus, the insulator effectively acts as an enhancer-blocker. On the paternal chromosome, methylation at the ICR not only prevents CTCF from binding, allowing Igf2 to engage the enhancers, but it is also required for methylation at the H19 promoter and silencing of H19. The ICR includes a differentially methylated promoter that regulates the expression of an ncRNA; when unmethylated the ncRNA is expressed and represses cis-linked genes. In contrast, when the ICR is methylated, the ncRNA is repressed and the cis-linked genes are expressed. Hypermethylation of maternal imprint control region (ICR) causes loss of function. In Wilm’s tumor, maternal ICR is methylated and makes double doses of Igf2 and cause tumor.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The gene switches on and off by plastering either their DNA or the proteins which support that DNA in chromosomes with clusters of atoms called methyl and acetyl groups. The nature of these reactions means epigenetic processes are susceptible to chemical intervention in a way that genetic mutations are not.Two other sorts of epigenetic drugs are already on the market. DNA-demethylating agents, in the form of azacitidine sold as Vidaza and decitabine sold as Dacogen are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, the precursors of acute myelogenous leukaemia. And histone-deacetylase inhibitors are being used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Decitabine is nucleoside analog which binds DNMT after they are incorporated into the DNA upon replication and inhibit the function of DNMT. Therefore this drugs are replication dependent and targets to suppress rapid growth of cancer but there is still unclear in their mechanism of action.</p>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>More recently, researchers led by Stephen Baylin have shown that a combination of a histone-deacetylase inhibitor and azacitidine slowed tumour growth in some people with advanced lung cancer. It was the first time epigenetic drugs had been deployed successfully against a solid tumour, rather than a leukaemia or a lymphoma. Dr Baylin speculates that his epigenetic drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more susceptible to standard chemotherapy. Unlike other forms of gene regulation, epigenetic changes are passed on during cell division to daughter and granddaughter cells until they are actively erased. Once erased, though, they do not return. It might be that epigenetic therapies can effect changes which stop a cancer growing without having to kill all its cells. In contract, epigenetic drugs should not be given in younger patients, particularly those who have been developing germ cells because they are in sensitive period. The sensitive period is the time at which the epigenetic reprogramming is done.There are two periods: primodial germ cell development and preimplantation period. If the epigenetic machinery is inhibited at sensitive period by epigenetic drugs such as DNMTi, germ cell cannot be methylated and this process is inherited .</p></div>
