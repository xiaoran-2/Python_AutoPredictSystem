    <div class="field-value"><p>Dysregulation of normal epigenetic mechanisms is found in all cancer tumor types, highlighting the fundamental importance of epigenetic as well as genetic changes in the pathogenesis of cancer. Of these epigenetic mechanisms, aberrant DNA methylation is the best understood in the context of cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DNA methylation occurs at CpGs in three distinct regions in the genome – CpG islands (CGIs) at the promoters of genes, within repetitive elements and between coding regions, namely intergenic regions and introns. Although approximately 60% of promoters contain CGIs (Magazine article: (2012, 7th April). <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168">Cancer's epicentre</a>. The Economist), such regions are generally unmethylated and such genes may be either active or inactive in normal tissue. Those few promoters containing methylated CGIs invariable result in silencing of those loci. In cancerous tissue, and as the disease progresses, CGIs at promoters and the adjacent CGI shores become increasingly methylated. The genes that are affected tend to be tumor suppressors or silencing of imprint control regions containing growth-restricting genes, allowing cancer cells to escape normal growth suppression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In normal tissue, DNA methylation is found predominantly in repetitive elements and intergenic or intronic regions. The genome contains many cryptic transcription start sites and splice sites, which are silenced by DNA methylation to maintain correct transcription. Repetitive elements are methylated to prevent transposition and illegitimate recombination between repeats. When DNA methylation is removed from these intergenic and intronic regions or from repetitive elements, as occurs to varying degrees in all cancers, genomic instability ensues and leads to a range of genetic recombination events and disruption of the normal transcription program. For example, hypomethylation of CpG-poor promoters can occur and results in activation of growth-promoting onocogenes, such as <em>R-RAS </em>in gastric cancer.  </p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="323cdd9789545f83">Q2. Describe how disruption of imprinting can contribute to cancer, using the example of the H19/Igf2 cluster. In your
answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the paternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe the methylation pattern of the maternal allele and how this determines
        Igf2 expression status.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Describe how imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster is disrupted in Wilm’s tumour.&nbsp;
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain how disrupting imprinting at the H19/Igf2 cluster contributes to cancer.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Genomic imprinting is the means by which a cell achieves monoallelic gene expression in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. Imprinting is achieved through various mechanisms but all imprint control regions (ICRs) display DNA methylation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imprinting of the H19/Igf2 cluster achieves monoallelic expression through enhancer blocking. The imprinted paternal allele is methylated at the ICR, which prevents binding of the ICR by CTCF, an insulator protein. On the maternal allele, CTCF bind to the unmethylated ICR, preventing the access of downstream enhancers to the upstream <em>Igf2</em> gene. The enhancers therefore default to activating expression of the adjacent <em>H19</em> gene, whilst maternal <em>Igf2</em> remains unexpressed. In the absence of CTCF binding to the methylated ICR on the paternal locus, the enhancers are free to access and activate paternal expression of <em>Igf2</em>. Furthermore, DNA methylation at the ICR spreads to the <em>H19 </em>promoter, silencing its expression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wilms tumour is characterized by the maternal H19/Igf2 allele taking on a paternal allele-like identity. In tumour tissue, the maternal ICR is aberrantly methylated, resulting in activation of <em>Igf2</em> expression from both parental alleles. As IGF2 is a growth promoter, overexpression results in abnormal, uncontrolled tissue growth, resulting in a tumour.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="961ab4c640df430a">Q3. The Economist article “<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552168" target="_blank">Cancer’s epicentre</a>” describes several drugs that affect
    epigenetic processes. Explain how Decitabine may be used to treat cancer,
    with reference to effects on the epigenome. In your answer include the
    following points:
<br>
<p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the class of epigenetic inhibitors that Decitabine belongs to.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the impact of Decitabine on DNA methylation.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>Describe how Decitabine can have an anti-tumour effect.&nbsp;
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Epigenetic mechanisms are attractive drug targets as they can be manipulated in ways that are impossible with cancer-causing mutations at the genetic level. The drug Decitabine specifically targets DNA methyltransferases and is therefore called a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi). Decitabine is a nucleoside analogue, meaning it can be incorporated into a cell’s DNA through DNA replication during cellular division. Rapidly diving cancer cells are therefore more targeted than normal cells.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once incorporated into the cellular genome, Decitabine molecules irreversibly bind to DNA methyltransferases, effectively sequestering them away and preventing them from aberrantly hypermethylating the genome. Although Decitabine’s mechanism of action is not fully understood, given that it is effective in haematological malignancies that depends upon hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, Decitabine is likely to act by indirectly restoring hypomethylation and therefore expression at tumour suppressor loci, restoring growth-suppression and restricting tumour growth.</p></div>

    <div class="field-name" id="10aa9d89e69a5f7a">Q4. Dr Stephen Baylin speculates in the Economist article that "epigenetic
drugs altered the tumour cells in some lasting way that made them more
susceptible to standard chemotherapy." How can drugs that alter DNA methylation
have effects that last beyond the period of drug treatment? Discuss whether
there are any periods of development when you would avoid treating patients
with such drugs. In your answer include the following points:
<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>Describe how altering DNA methylation can have enduring effects on the
        epigenome.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Define what is meant by a sensitive period.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Identify sensitive periods of development.
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Explain why treating patients during sensitive periods would be inadvisable.
    <br>
</li>
</ul></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Unlike other epigenetic marks, it is well understood how DNA methylation is maintained through DNA replication and cell division. DNMT1 methylates newly replicated DNA, using the parent, methylated strand as a template for the daughter, unmethylated strand and thus new cells maintain the same DNA methylation pattern as the parent cells. Drugs that affect DNA methylation, such as azacitidine which demethylates DNA, can therefore have enduring effects as the changes to DNA methylation are inherited beyond the period of drug treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, the action of such drugs is not limited to cancer tissues and the long term effects of treatment on normal cells is not currently known. Furthermore, it is imperative to avoid treating patients at sensitive periods of development. Such periods occur when the genome is susceptible to external influences affecting normal epigenetic reprogramming, namely during early development of the pre-implantation blastocyst and during primordial germ cell development and germ cell maturation. Thus, women with any chance of being pregnant should not be treated by drugs such as azacitidine to avoid affecting the epigenetic reprogramming of her pre-implantation embryo or the primordial germ cells of her unborn child later in pregnancy. </p></div>
